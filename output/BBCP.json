(Nasdaq: BBCP) (the “Company” or “CPH”), a leading provider of concrete pumping and concrete waste management services in the U.S. and U.K., announced that Brundage-Bone Concrete Pumping Holdings Inc. (the \"Issuer\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has amended and restated its existing ABL credit agreement (the “ABL Facility”) to provide up to $350 million (previously $225 million) of commitments and extend the maturity of the ABL Facility to September 6, 2029. Of the additional $125 million in commitments, $75 million was provided by Bank of America, N.A., which joins the facility as a joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner, and $50 million in additional commitments was provided by PNC Bank, National Association, acting as a joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner.\n\n“We are delighted to welcome the team at Bank of America to our ABL banking relationship,” said Iain Humphries, CFO of Concrete Pumping Holdings. “The additional commitment provided by the PNC team and continued support from our Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase relationships are greatly appreciated as we focus on executing our long-term strategic growth plan. This ABL upsize and maturity extension significantly improves our already strong liquidity position, enhances our ability to pursue accretive investment opportunities and creates optionality as we address our long-term capital structure to support our growth strategy.”\n\n**About Concrete Pumping Holdings**\n\nConcrete Pumping Holdings is the leading provider of concrete pumping services and concrete waste management services in the fragmented U.S. and U.K. markets, primarily operating under what we believe are the only established, national brands in both geographies – Brundage-Bone for concrete pumping in the U.S., Camfaud in the U.K., and Eco-Pan for waste management services in both the U.S. and U.K. The Company’s large fleet of specialized pumping equipment and trained operators position it to deliver concrete placement solutions that facilitate labor cost savings to customers, shorten concrete placement times, enhance worksite safety and improve construction quality.

(Nasdaq: BBCP) (the \"Company\" or \"CPH\"), a leading provider of concrete pumping and waste management services in the U.S. and U.K., reported financial results for the third quarter ended July 31, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Summary vs. Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023**(unless otherwise noted)\n\n● | Revenue of $109.6 million compared to $120.7 million.  \n---|---  \n● | Gross profit of $44.5 million compared to $49.5 million.  \n● | Income from operations of $16.6 million compared to $19.5 million.  \n● | Net income of $7.6 million compared to $10.3 million.  \n● | Net income attributable to common shareholders of $7.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share and net income margin of 6.9%, compared to $9.9 million or $0.18 per diluted share and net income margin of 8.6%.  \n● | Adjusted EBITDA1 of $31.6 million compared to $34.9 million, with Adjusted EBITDA margin1 of 28.8% compared to 28.9%.  \n● | Amounts outstanding under debt agreements were $375.0 million with net debt1 of $348.7 million. Total available liquidity was $236.3 million as of July 31, 2024, compared to $195.5 million as of July 31, 2023.  \n  \n**Management Commentary**\n\n“In the third quarter, continued organic growth in our U.S. Concrete Waste Management business was offset by a series of factors that impacted volume-driven declines in our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment,” said CPH CEO Bruce Young. “Historic rainfall in Texas and across the southeast region, together with ongoing restrictive monetary policy, curtailed construction volumes for the quarter. Higher interest rates have impacted the timing of more rate-sensitive commercial projects, and higher commercial building vacancy rates have delayed project starts on new build projects. Meanwhile, our Concrete Waste Management business continued to grow at an impressive double-digit rate, driven by healthy market share growth and our ability to improve pricing. We expect the tailwinds in this business to continue.\"\n\n“Despite the weaker overall demand environment, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by paying down debt and preserving our free cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA margin. This speaks to our strong financial profile and unit economics, as well as our disciplined approach to managing our fleet. While we expect the demand environment to remain variable in the final quarter of our fiscal year, we believe our scale, the strength of our balance sheet and our robust liquidity has us positioned to drive strong shareholder returns as the commercial end market recovers.”\n\n1 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt and leverage ratio are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release and a reconciliation to their most comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024** **Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $109.6 million compared to $120.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The decrease was mostly attributable to a decline in the Company’s U.S. Concrete Pumping segment due to a slowdown in commercial construction work, an oversaturation of concrete pumps in certain markets and higher than normal rainfall throughout the quarter in certain markets. This was partially offset by continued strong growth in the Concrete Waste Management Services segment.\n\nGross profit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $44.5 million compared to $49.5 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin was 40.6% compared to 41.0% in the prior year quarter, primarily related to lower revenue in the Company's U.S. Concrete Pumping segment and higher depreciation expense, offset by improved labor, fuel and repair and maintenance costs.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the third quarter decreased to $27.9 million compared to $29.9 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was largely due to non-cash decreases in amortization expense of $1.0 million, stock-based compensation of $0.3 million and lower labor costs of approximately $0.8 million. As a percentage of revenue, G&A costs were 25.5% in the third quarter compared to 24.8% in the prior year quarter.\n\nNet income in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $7.6 million compared to $10.3 million in the prior year quarter. Net income attributable to common shareholders in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $7.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $9.9 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $31.6 million compared to $34.9 million in the prior year quarter due to the lower revenue and gross profit, as discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.8% compared to the prior year quarter at 28.9%.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nOn July 31, 2024, the Company had debt outstanding of $375.0 million, net debt of $348.7 million and total available liquidity of $236.3 million.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\n**_U.S. Concrete Pumping._** Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased to $75.2 million compared to $87.3 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower volumes caused by a general slowdown in commercial construction work, mostly due to the price sensitive impact on project starts from high interest rates, oversaturation of concrete pumps in certain markets and higher than normal rainfall in the Company's southeast regions and historically high rainfall in the Company's Texas markets. Net income in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $3.5 million compared to $3.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $20.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to $22.7 million in the prior year quarter, largely driven by the revenue decline.\n\n**_U.K. Operations._** Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $15.9 million compared to $17.3 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact from foreign currency translation, revenue was down 9% year-over-year due to lower volumes caused by a general slowdown in commercial construction work, mostly due to the impact from high interest rates. Net income in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $0.9 million compared to $1.6 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to $4.8 million in the prior year quarter due to lower volumes caused by a general slowdown in commercial construction work, mostly due to the impact from high interest rates, partially offset by a reduction in repair costs.\n\n**_U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services._** Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 increased 15% to $18.5 million compared to $16.1 million in the prior year quarter, driven by robust organic growth and pricing improvements. Net income in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $3.1 million compared to $4.0 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased 2% to $7.3 million compared to $7.5 million in the prior year quarter as inflationary increases in labor and higher corporate allocations more than offset the impact to net income and Adjusted EBITDA from the increase in revenue.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company now expects fiscal year 2024 revenue to range between $420.0 million and $430.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA to range between $108.0 million and $113.0 million and free cash flow2 of at least $67.0 million. The Company expects to end fiscal year 2024 with a leverage ratio3 of approximately 3.0x.\n\n2 Free cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less net replacement capital expenditures and cash paid for interest.3 Leverage ratio defined as net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA over the trailing four quarters.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its third quarter 2024 results.\n\nDate: Wednesday, September 4, 2024Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (3:00 p.m. Mountain time)Toll-free dial-in number: 1-877-407-9039International dial-in number: 1-201-689-8470Conference ID: 13748082\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

The Company’s actual results may differ from expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"budget,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"believes,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"outlook\" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the Company’s expectations with respect to future performance, including the Company's fiscal year 2024 outlook. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Most of these factors are outside the Company’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the adverse impact of recent inflationary pressures, global economic conditions and developments related to these conditions, such as fluctuations in fuel costs on our business; adverse weather conditions; the outcome of any legal proceedings, rulings or demand letters that may be instituted against or sent to the Company or its subsidiaries; the ability of the Company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; the ability to complete targeted acquisitions and to realize the expected benefits from completed acquisitions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release presents Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt and free cash flow, all of which are important financial measures for the Company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.\n\nEBITDA is calculated by taking GAAP net income and adding back interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and adding back loss on debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation, changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities, other expense (income), net, goodwill and intangibles impairment and other adjustments. Other adjustments include non-recurring expenses, non-cash currency gains/losses, transaction expenses and interest income. Transaction expenses represent expenses for legal, accounting, and other professionals that were engaged in the completion of various acquisitions. Transaction expenses can be volatile as they are primarily driven by the size of a specific acquisition. As such, the Company excludes these amounts from Adjusted EBITDA for comparability across periods.\n\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends related to our financial condition and results of operations, and as a supplemental tool for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with competitors who also present similar non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, these measures (1) are used in quarterly and annual financial reports and presentations prepared for management, our board of directors and investors, and (2) help management to determine incentive compensation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as comparative measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue for the period presented. See below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nNet debt is calculated as all amounts outstanding under debt agreements (currently this includes the Company’s term loan and revolving line of credit balances, excluding any offsets for capitalized deferred financing costs) measured in accordance with GAAP less cash. Cash is subtracted from the GAAP measure because it could be used to reduce the Company’s debt obligations. A limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. CPH believes this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to management and investors in order to monitor the Company’s leverage and evaluate the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. See \"Non-GAAP Measures (Reconciliation of Net Debt)\" below for a reconciliation of Net Debt to amounts outstanding under debt agreements calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four quarters. The Company believes its leverage ratio measures its ability to service its debt and its ability to make capital expenditures. Additionally, the leverage ratio is a standard measurement used by investors to gauge the creditworthiness of an institution.\n\nFree cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less net replacement capital expenditures and cash paid for interest. This measure is not a substitute for cash flow from operations and does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt servicing payments, are not deducted from the measure. CPH believes this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to management and investors in order to monitor and evaluate the cash flow yield of the business.\n\nThe financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and net debt to the applicable most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. However, the Company has not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance range and free cash flow range included in this press release to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the lack of predictability regarding the various reconciling items such as provision for income tax expense and depreciation and amortization**.**\n\nCurrent and prospective investors should review the Company’s audited annual and unaudited interim financial statements, which are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, net debt and free cash flow differently and therefore these measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n**Contact:**\n\n**Company:** Iain HumphriesChief Financial Officer1-303-289-7497 |  **Investor Relations:** Gateway Group, Inc.Cody Slach1-949-574-3860BBCP@gateway-grp.com  \n---|---  \n**Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n---  \n**As of July 31,** | **As of October 31,**  \n_(in thousands, except per share amounts)_ | **2024** | **2023**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 26,333 | $ | 15,861  \nReceivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,076 and $978, respectively | 56,214 | 62,976  \nInventory | 6,568 | 6,732  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 13,357 | 8,701  \n**Total current assets** | 102,472 | 94,270  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net | 423,486 | 427,648  \nIntangible assets, net | 109,253 | 120,244  \nGoodwill | 222,964 | 221,517  \nRight-of-use operating lease assets | 26,734 | 24,815  \nOther non-current assets | 4,392 | 14,250  \nDeferred financing costs | 1,489 | 1,781  \n**Total assets** | $ | 890,790 | $ | 904,525  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nRevolving loan | $ | -

          "content": "September 4, 2024\nConcrete Pumping Holdings Reports Third\nQuarter Fiscal Year 2024 Results\nDENVER, Sept. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc.\n(Nasdaq: BBCP) (the \"Company\" or \"CPH\"), a leading provider of concrete pumping and\nwaste management services in the U.S. and U.K., reported financial results for the third\nquarter ended July 31, 2024.\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Summary vs. Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023 (unless\notherwise noted)\n●Revenue of $109.6 million compared to $120.7 million.\n●Gross profit of $44.5 million compared to $49.5 million.\n●Income from operations of $16.6 million compared to $19.5 million.\n●Net income of $7.6 million compared to $10.3 million.\n●Net income attributable to common shareholders of $7.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share and net income margin of 6.9%,\ncompared to $9.9 million or $0.18 per diluted share and net income margin of 8.6%.\n●Adjusted EBITDA1 of $31.6 million compared to $34.9 million, with Adjusted EBITDA margin1 of 28.8% compared to 28.9%.\n●Amounts outstanding under debt agreements were $375.0 million with net debt1 of $348.7 million. Total available liquidity was\n$236.3 million as of July 31, 2024, compared to $195.5 million as of July 31, 2023.\nManagement Commentary\n“In the third quarter, continued organic growth in our U.S. Concrete Waste Management\nbusiness was offset by a series of factors that impacted volume-driven declines in our U.S.\nConcrete Pumping segment,” said CPH CEO Bruce Young. “Historic rainfall in Texas and\nacross the southeast region, together with ongoing restrictive monetary policy, curtailed\nconstruction volumes for the quarter. Higher interest rates have impacted the timing of more\nrate-sensitive commercial projects, and higher commercial building vacancy rates have\ndelayed project starts on new build projects. Meanwhile, our Concrete Waste Management\nbusiness continued to grow at an impressive double-digit rate, driven by healthy market\nshare growth and our ability to improve pricing. We expect the tailwinds in this business to\ncontinue.\"\n“Despite the weaker overall demand environment, we continue to strengthen our balance\nsheet by paying down debt and preserving our free cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nThis speaks to our strong financial profile and unit economics, as well as our disciplined\napproach to managing our fleet. While we expect the demand environment to remain\nvariable in the final quarter of our fiscal year, we believe our scale, the strength of our\nbalance sheet and our robust liquidity has us positioned to drive strong shareholder returns\nas the commercial end market recovers.”\n1 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt and leverage ratio are financial\nmeasures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\"\nbelow for a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release and a\nreconciliation to their most comparable GAAP measures.\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results\nRevenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $109.6 million compared to $120.7\nmillion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The decrease was mostly attributable to\na decline in the Company’s U.S. Concrete Pumping segment due to a slowdown in\ncommercial construction work, an oversaturation of concrete pumps in certain markets and\nhigher than normal rainfall throughout the quarter in certain markets. This was partially offset\nby continued strong growth in the Concrete Waste Management Services segment.\nGross profit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $44.5 million compared to $49.5\nmillion in the prior year quarter. Gross margin was 40.6% compared to 41.0% in the prior\nyear quarter, primarily related to lower revenue in the Company's U.S. Concrete Pumping\nsegment and higher depreciation expense, offset by improved labor, fuel and repair and\nmaintenance costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the third quarter decreased to $27.9 million\ncompared to $29.9 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was largely due to non-\ncash decreases in amortization expense of $1.0 million, stock-based compensation of $0.3\nmillion and lower labor costs of approximately $0.8 million. As a percentage of revenue, G&A\ncosts were 25.5% in the third quarter compared to 24.8% in the prior year quarter.\nNet income in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $7.6 million compared to $10.3\nmillion in the prior year quarter. Net income attributable to common shareholders in the third\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 was $7.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $9.9\nmillion, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $31.6 million\ncompared to $34.9 million in the prior year quarter due to the lower revenue and gross profit,\nas discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.8% compared to the prior year\nquarter at 28.9%.\nLiquidity\nOn July 31, 2024, the Company had debt outstanding of $375.0 million, net debt of $348.7\nmillion and total available liquidity of $236.3 million.\nSegment Results\nU.S. Concrete Pumping. Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased to $75.2\nmillion compared to $87.3 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily\nattributable to lower volumes caused by a general slowdown in commercial construction\nwork, mostly due to the price sensitive impact on project starts from high interest rates,\noversaturation of concrete pumps in certain markets and higher than normal rainfall in the\nCompany's southeast regions and historically high rainfall in the Company's Texas markets.\nNet income in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $3.5 million compared to\n$3.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $20.1 million in the third quarter\nof fiscal year 2024 compared to $22.7 million in the prior year quarter, largely driven by the\nrevenue decline.\nU.K. Operations. Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $15.9 million\ncompared to $17.3 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact from foreign\ncurrency translation, revenue was down 9% year-over-year due to lower volumes caused by\na general slowdown in commercial construction work, mostly due to the impact from\nhigh interest rates. Net income in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased to $0.9\nmillion compared to $1.6 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.2 million\nin the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to $4.8 million in the prior year quarter due\nto lower volumes caused by a general slowdown in commercial construction work, mostly\ndue to the impact from high interest rates, partially offset by a reduction in repair costs.\nU.S. Concrete Waste Management Services. Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year\n2024 increased 15% to $18.5 million compared to $16.1 million in the prior year quarter,\ndriven by robust organic growth and pricing improvements. Net income in the third quarter of\nfiscal year 2024 decreased to $3.1 million compared to $4.0 million in the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased 2% to $7.3 million\ncompared to $7.5 million in the prior year quarter as inflationary increases in labor and\nhigher corporate allocations more than offset the impact to net income and Adjusted\nEBITDA from the increase in revenue.\nFiscal Year 2024 Outlook\nThe Company now expects fiscal year 2024 revenue to range between $420.0 million and\n$430.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA to range between $108.0 million and $113.0 million and\nfree cash flow2 of at least $67.0 million.

Highly\ncomplementary to its core concrete pumping service, Eco-Pan seeks to provide a full-\nservice, cost-effective, regulatory-compliant solution to manage environmental issues\ncaused by concrete washout. As of July 31, 2024, the Company provided concrete pumping\nservices in the U.S. from a footprint of approximately 100 branch locations across 21 states,\nconcrete pumping services in the U.K. from approximately 30 branch locations, and route-\nbased concrete waste management services from 20 operating locations in the U.S. and 1\nshared location in the U.K. For more information, please visit\nwww.concretepumpingholdings.com or the Company’s brand websites at\nwww.brundagebone.com, www.camfaud.co.uk, or www.eco-pan.com.\nForward‐Looking Statements\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe\nharbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company’s\nactual results may differ from expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you\nshould not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words\nsuch as \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"budget,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\"\n\"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"believes,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"outlook\" and\nsimilar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-\nlooking statements include, without limitation, the Company’s expectations with respect to\nfuture performance, including the Company's fiscal year 2024 outlook. These forward-\nlooking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results\nto differ materially from expected results. Most of these factors are outside the Company’s\ncontrol and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are\nnot limited to: the adverse impact of recent inflationary pressures, global economic\nconditions and developments related to these conditions, such as fluctuations in fuel costs\non our business; adverse weather conditions; the outcome of any legal proceedings, rulings\nor demand letters that may be instituted against or sent to the Company or its subsidiaries;\nthe ability of the Company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key\nemployees; the ability to complete targeted acquisitions and to realize the expected benefits\nfrom completed acquisitions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that\nthe Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive\nfactors; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the Company’s filings\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors in the Company's\nlatest Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Company\ncautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. The Company cautions readers not\nto place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the\ndate made. The Company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to\nrelease publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any\nchange in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which\nany such statement is based.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release presents Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt and free\ncash flow, all of which are important financial measures for the Company but are not\nfinancial measures defined by GAAP.\nEBITDA is calculated by taking GAAP net income and adding back interest expense and\namortization of deferred financing costs, income tax expense, and depreciation and\namortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and adding back loss on debt\nextinguishment, stock-based compensation, changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities,\nother expense (income), net, goodwill and intangibles impairment and other adjustments.\nOther adjustments include non-recurring expenses, non-cash currency\ngains/losses, transaction expenses and interest income. Transaction expenses represent\nexpenses for legal, accounting, and other professionals that were engaged in the completion\nof various acquisitions. Transaction expenses can be volatile as they are primarily driven by\nthe size of a specific acquisition. As such, the Company excludes these amounts from\nAdjusted EBITDA for comparability across periods.\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful\nsupplemental information to management and investors regarding certain financial and\nbusiness trends related to our financial condition and results of operations, and as a\nsupplemental tool for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends\nand in comparing our financial measures with competitors who also present similar non-\nGAAP financial measures. In addition, these measures (1) are used in quarterly and annual\nfinancial reports and presentations prepared for management, our board of directors and\ninvestors, and (2) help management to determine incentive compensation. EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures\nexclude certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. In addition, other\ncompanies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently or may\nnot calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as\ncomparative measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by\ntotal revenue for the period presented. See below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to\nnet income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNet debt is calculated as all amounts outstanding under debt agreements (currently this\nincludes the Company’s term loan and revolving line of credit balances, excluding any\noffsets for capitalized deferred financing costs) measured in accordance with GAAP less\ncash. Cash is subtracted from the GAAP measure because it could be used to reduce the\nCompany’s debt obligations. A limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts\ncash and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable\nGAAP measure indicates. CPH believes this non-GAAP measure provides useful information\nto management and investors in order to monitor the Company’s leverage and evaluate the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheet. See \"Non-GAAP Measures (Reconciliation of Net\nDebt)\" below for a reconciliation of Net Debt to amounts outstanding under debt agreements\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four\nquarters. The Company believes its leverage ratio measures its ability to service its debt and\nits ability to make capital expenditures. Additionally, the leverage ratio is a standard\nmeasurement used by investors to gauge the creditworthiness of an institution.\nFree cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less net replacement capital expenditures\nand cash paid for interest. This measure is not a substitute for cash flow from operations and\ndoes not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since\ncertain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt servicing payments, are not deducted\nfrom the measure. CPH believes this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to\nmanagement and investors in order to monitor and evaluate the cash flow yield of the\nbusiness.\nThe financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of\nAdjusted EBITDA and net debt to the applicable most comparable U.S. GAAP financial\nmeasure. However, the Company has not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA\nguidance range and free cash flow range included in this press release to the most directly\ncomparable forward-looking GAAP measures because this cannot be done without\nunreasonable effort due to the lack of predictability regarding the various reconciling items\nsuch as provision for income tax expense and depreciation and amortization.\nCurrent and prospective investors should review the Company’s audited annual and\nunaudited interim financial statements, which are filed with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the\nCompany’s business. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, net debt and free\ncash flow differently and therefore these measures may not be directly comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies.\nContact:\nCompany: Investor Relations:\nIain Humphries Gateway Group, Inc.\nChief Financial Officer Cody Slach\n1-303-289-7497 1-949-574-3860\nBBCP@gateway-grp.com\nConcrete Pumping Holdings, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of October\nAs of July 31, 31,\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) 2024 2023\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 26,333 $ 15,861\nReceivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,076 and $978, respectively 56,214 62,976\nInventory 6,568 6,732\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 13,357 8,701\nTotal current assets 102,472 94,270\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 423,486 427,648\nIntangible assets, net 109,253 120,244\nGoodwill 222,964 221,517\nRight-of-use operating lease assets 26,734 24,815\nOther non-current assets 4,392 14,250\nDeferred financing costs 1,489 1,781\nTotal assets $ 890,790 $ 904,525\nCurrent liabilities:\nRevolving loan $ -

(the \"Company\") is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Thornton, Colorado. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries including Brundage-Bone Concrete Pumping, Inc. (\"Brundage-Bone\"), Camfaud Group Limited (\"Camfaud\") and Eco-Pan, Inc. (\"Eco-Pan\").\n\n**_Nature of business_**\n\nBrundage-Bone is a concrete pumping service provider in the United States (\"U.S.\") and Camfaud is a concrete pumping service provider in the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"). Their core business is the provision of concrete pumping services to general contractors and concrete finishing companies in the commercial, infrastructure and residential sectors. Most often equipment returns to a \"home base\" nightly and these service providers do _not_ contract to purchase, mix, or deliver concrete. Brundage-Bone has approximately  _100_ branch locations across 21 states, with its corporate headquarters in Thornton, Colorado. Camfaud has approximately 30 branch locations throughout the U.K., with its corporate headquarters in Epping (near London), England.\n\nEco-Pan provides industrial cleanup and containment services, primarily to customers in the construction industry. Eco-Pan uses containment pans specifically designed to hold waste products from concrete and other industrial cleanup operations. Eco-Pan has 20 operating locations across the U.S. with its corporate headquarters in Thornton, Colorado. In addition, we have concrete waste management operations under our Eco-Pan brand name in the U.K. and currently operate from a shared Camfaud location.\n\n_**Seasonality**_\n\nThe Company’s sales are historically seasonal, with lower revenue in the _first_ quarter and higher revenue in the _fourth_ quarter of each year. Such seasonality also causes the Company’s working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter and primarily depends on the variability of weather patterns with the Company generally having lower sales volume during the winter and spring months.\n\n**[](# \"Note 2 Summary of Sig Acct Policies\")Note _2._ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\nWe describe our significant accounting policies in Note _2_ of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in our annual report on [Form _10_ -K for the year ended _October 31, 2023 (_ \"Annual Report\")](http://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1703956/000143774924001415/bbpp20231031_10k.htm). During the _nine_ months ended _July 31, 2024_ , there were _no_ changes to those accounting policies.\n\n**_Basis of presentation_**\n\nOur condensed consolidated balance sheet as of _October 31, 2023,_ which was derived from our audited condensed consolidated financial statements and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements provided herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form _10_ -Q. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Accordingly, they do _not_ include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The enclosed statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present a fair statement of the interim periods. The consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the _first_ _nine_ months of the year are _not_ necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations and cash flows that might be expected for the entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form _10_ -K for the year ended _October 31, 2023._\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nDuring the _first_ quarter of fiscal year _2024,_ certain assets and associated revenues and expenses previously part of the Company's Other activities were aggregated into its U.S. Concrete Pumping segment in order to better align its placement with the manner in which the Company now allocates resources and measures performance. As a result, segment results for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. For further discussion, see [Note _18_](#Note_17_Segment_Reporting).\n\n_9_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Use of estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n**_Revenue recognition_**\n\nThe Company generates revenues primarily from (_1_) concrete pumping services in both the U.S. and U.K and (_2_) the Company’s concrete waste services business, both of which are discussed below. In addition, the Company generates an immaterial amount of revenue from the sales of replacement parts to customers. The Company’s delivery terms for replacement part sales are FOB shipping point. Revenue is disaggregated between _two_ accounting standards: (_1_) ASC _606,_ _Revenue Recognition_(\"ASC _606\"_) and (_2_) ASC _842,_ _Leases_(\"ASC _842\"_).\n\n_Leases as Lessor_\n\nOur Eco-Pan business involves contracts with customers whereby we are a lessor for the rental component of the contract and therefore, such rental components of the contract are recorded as lease revenue. We account for such rental contracts as operating leases. We recognize revenue from pan rentals in the period earned, regardless of the timing of billing to customers. The lease component of the revenue is disaggregated by a base price that is based on the number of contractual days and a variable component that is based on days in excess of the number of contractual days.\n\nThe table below summarizes our revenues as presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods ended  _July 31, 2024_ and _2023_ by revenue type:\n\n**__Three Months Ended July 31,__** |  **__Nine Months Ended July 31,__**  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands)_ |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_** |  **_2024_** |  **_2023_**  \nService revenue | $| 100,575| $| 112,340| $| 289,262| $| 299,521  \nLease fixed revenue | 5,744| 5,237| 15,516| 13,453  \nLease variable revenue | 3,298| 3,094| 9,612| 9,063  \nTotal revenue | $| 109,617| $| 120,671| $| 314,390| $| 322,037  \n  \n**_Receivables and contract assets and liabilities_**\n\nReceivables are carried at the original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts. Generally, the Company does _not_ require collateral for their accounts receivable; however, the Company _may_ file statutory liens or take other appropriate legal action when necessary on construction projects in which collection problems arise. A receivable is typically considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than _30_ days. The Company does _not_ typically charge interest on past-due receivables.\n\nPursuant to CECL (defined below), Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts, Management’s understanding of the current economic circumstances within the Company’s industry, reasonable and supportable forecasts and Management’s judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate payment based upon available data. Receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received. Our estimate of doubtful accounts could change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, the Company _may_ be required to increase or decrease the allowance for doubtful accounts.\n\nThe Company does _not_ have contract liabilities associated with contracts with customers. The Company’s contract assets and impairment losses associated therewith are _not_ significant. Contracts with customers do _not_ result in amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue.\n\n_10_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Newly adopted accounting pronouncements_**\n\nASU _2016_ -_13,_ Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic _326_) (\"ASU _2016_ -_13\"_) - In _June 2016,_ the FASB issued ASU _No._ _2016_ -_13,_ which, along with subsequently issued related ASUs, requires financial assets (or groups of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, among other provisions (known as the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model). Under the new guidance, the Company recognizes an allowance for its estimate of expected credit losses over the entire contractual term of its receivables from the date of initial recognition of the financial instrument. Measurement of expected credit losses are based on relevant forecasts that affect collectability. The Company’s receivables are in scope for CECL. At the point that these receivables are recorded, they become subject to the CECL model and estimates of expected credit losses over their contractual life are recorded at inception based on historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU is effective for smaller reporting companies with fiscal years beginning after _December 15, 2022,_ with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted CECL as of _November 1, 2023_ for fiscal year ending _October 31, 2024._ The adoption of CECL did _not_ have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures or the existing internal controls because the Company’s accounts receivable are of short duration and there is _not_ a material difference between incurred losses and expected losses.\n\n**_Recently issued accounting pronouncements _not_ yet effective _**\n\nASU _2023_ -_07,_ Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU _2023_ -_07\"_) - In _November 2023,_ the FASB issued ASU _No._ _2023_ -_07,_ which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The purpose of the amendments is to enable investors to better understand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. This ASU is effective for public companies with annual periods beginning after _December 15, 2023,_ and interim periods within annual period beginning after _December 15, 2024,_ with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nASU _2023_ -_09,_ Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\"ASU _2023_ -_09\"_) - In _December 2023,_ the FASB issued ASU _No._ _2023_ -_09,_ which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. This ASU is effective for public companies with annual periods beginning after _December 15, 2024,_ with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n_11_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Note _3._ Fair Value Measurement**\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and current accrued liabilities approximate their fair value as recorded due to the short-term maturity of these instruments, which approximates fair value. The Company’s outstanding obligations on its asset-backed loan (\"ABL\") credit facility are deemed to be at fair value as the interest rates on these debt obligations are variable and consistent with prevailing rates. There were _no_ changes since _October 31, 2023_ in the Company's valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\n\n_Long-term debt instruments_\n\nThe Company's long-term debt instruments are recorded at their carrying values in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, which _may_ differ from their respective fair values. The fair values of the long-term debt instruments are derived from Level _2_ inputs. The fair value amount of the long-term debt instruments as of  _July 31, 2024_ and _October 31, 2023_ is presented in the table below based on the prevailing interest rates and trading activity of the Senior Notes.\n\n**__As of July 31,__** |  **__As of October 31,__**  \n---|---  \n**__2024__** |  **__2023__**  \n_(in thousands)_ |  **_Carrying Value_** |  **_Fair Value_** |  **_Carrying Value_** |  **_Fair Value_**  \nSenior Notes | $| 375,000| $| 372,188| $| 375,000| $| 353,438  \n  \n_Warrants_\n\nAt  _October 31, 2023_ , there were 13,017,677 public warrants and no private warrants outstanding.

Effective _April 1, 2020,_ the state of Washington Department of Revenue (\"DOR\") published a rule which amended Washington Administrative Code _458_ -_20_ -_211,_ otherwise known as Rule _211,_ by designating sales of stand-alone concrete pumping services as solely retail transactions. The Company sought to strongly defend its position that _no_ sales tax should be charged for customers that provide a reseller certificate. As such, for the period from _April 1, 2020_ through _January 31, 2024,_ the Company did _not_ charge sales tax where its customers provide a reseller certificate and petitioned for declaratory relief from the amended rule.\n\nIn _February 2023,_ the Company received an adverse ruling from the Thurston County superior court in Washington State regarding its position, which it appealed. In _February 2024,_ oral arguments were heard in the Court of Appeals in Tacoma, Washington and the Company received an unfavorable judgement during the same month. As of _October 31, 2023,__no_ liability had been recorded in connection with this contingency as a loss was _not_ deemed probable at that time. However, as a result of the unfavorable judgment in _February 2024,_ the Company concluded loss is probable and therefore recorded a loss of $3.5 million in the quarter ended _January 31, 2024._ The loss is included in general and administrative expenses in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the _nine_ months ended _July 31, 2024_. During the quarter ended _January 31, 2024,_ the Company made a payment of $1.8 million to the DOR.

Revenue by segment is further discussed below.\n\n_U.S. Concrete Pumping._ Revenue for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment decreased by 13.9%, or $12.1 million, from $87.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to $75.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily attributable to a decrease in volumes driven by (1) a general slowdown in commercial construction work, mostly due to the price sensitive impact on project starts from high interest rates, (2) oversaturation of concrete pumps in certain markets and (3) higher than normal rainfall in the Company's southeast regions and historically high rainfall in the Company's Texas markets.\n\n_U.K. Operations._ Revenue for our U.K. Operations segment decreased by 8.1%, or $1.4 million, from $17.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to $15.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact from foreign currency translation, revenue was down 9% year-over-year, due to lower volumes caused by a general slowdown in commercial construction work, mostly due to the impact from high interest rates.\n\n_U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services._ Third-party revenue for the U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment improved by 15.3%, or $2.4 million, from $16.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to $18.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in revenue was driven by robust organic growth and pricing improvements.\n\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\n\n**Three Months Ended July 31,** |  **Change**  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands, unless otherwise stated)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **$** |  **%**  \n**Gross Profit and Gross Margin**  \nGross Profit | $ | 44,505 | $ | 49,484 | $ | (4,979 | ) | (10.1 | )%  \nGross Margin | 40.6 | % | 41.0 | %  \n  \n_Gross margin._ Our gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 40.6% compared to 41.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The slight decrease in gross margin was primarily related to lower revenue in our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment and an increase in depreciation expense offset by improved labor, fuel and repair and maintenance costs.\n\n26 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\n_General and administrative expenses (\"G &A\"). _G&A expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $27.9 million, a decrease of $2.0 million from $29.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. G&A expenses as a percent of revenue were 25.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 24.8% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in G&A expenses was largely due to (1) non-cash decreases in amortization expense of $1.0 million and stock-based compensation of $0.3 million, and (2) lower labor costs of approximately $0.8 million.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2024, excluding amortization of intangible assets of $3.7 million, depreciation expense of $0.6 million, and stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million, G&A expenses were $23.0 million (20.9% of revenue). For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, excluding amortization of intangible assets of $4.7 million, depreciation expense of $0.6 million and stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million G&A expenses were $23.7 million (19.6% of revenue). This decrease of $0.7 million is primarily due to the decreases in labor costs, as discussed above.\n\nTotal other income (expense)\n\n_Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs._ Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $6.3 million, down $0.8 million from $7.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average ABL revolver draw during the fiscal 2024 third quarter as compared to the same quarter a year ago.\n\n_Change in fair value of warrant liabilities._ During the three months ended July 31, 2024 the Company did not recognize any warrant fair value remeasurement as no warrants were outstanding during the period. During the three months ended July 31, 2023 the Company recognized a $0.9 million gain on the fair value measurement of our liability-classified warrants. On December 6, 2023, we announced the expiration of the Company's 13,017,677 warrants, as such they are no longer recognized as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 31, 2024.\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n_Income tax expense._ For the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate was 29.0% and 24.3%, respectively. The comparability of effective tax rates between both periods was primarily impacted by (1) increases in the UK corporate income tax rate to 25% and (2) the warrants fair value activity in the three months ended July 31, 2023, as it is not recognized for tax purposes.\n\n27 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_**Nine Months Ended July 31, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended July 31, 2023**_\n\nThe tables included in the period-to-period comparisons below provide summaries of our revenue and gross profit for our business segments for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nRevenue\n\n**Nine Months Ended July 31,** |  **Change**  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands, unless otherwise stated)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **$** |  **%**  \n**Revenue**  \nU.S. Concrete Pumping | $ | 216,514 | $ | 232,896 | $ | (16,382 | ) | (7.0 | )%  \nU.K. Operations | 46,813 | 45,207 | 1,606 | 3.6 | %  \nU.S. Concrete Waste Management Services - Third parties | 51,063 | 43,934 | 7,129 | 16.2 | %  \nU.S. Concrete Waste Management Services - Intersegment | 331 | 511 | (180 | ) | *  \nIntersegment eliminations | (331 | ) | (511 | ) | 180 | *  \nReportable segment revenue | $ | 314,390 | $ | 322,037 | $ | (7,647 | ) | (2.4 | )%  \n  \n_*Change is not meaningful_\n\n_Total revenue._ Total revenues were $314.4 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to $322.0 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. Revenue by segment is further discussed below.\n\n_U.S. Concrete Pumping._ Revenue for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment decreased by 7.0%, or $16.4 million, from $232.9 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023 to $216.5 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 primarily attributable to (1) a general slowdown in commercial construction work, mostly due to the impact from high interest rates, (2) oversaturation of concrete pumps in certain markets, and (3) much higher than normal rainfall in the Company's Texas markets for the nine months ended July 31, 2024.\n\n_U.K. Operations._ Revenue for our U.K. Operations segment increased by 3.6%, or $1.6 million, from $45.2 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023 to $46.8 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024. Excluding the impact from foreign currency translation, revenue was up 1% year-over-year. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to pricing improvements that more than offset the volume declines as a result of continued delays on project start dates and awards.\n\n_U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services._ Third-party revenue for the U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment increased by 16.2%, or $7.2 million, from $43.9 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023 to $51.1 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024. The increase in revenue was driven by robust organic growth and pricing improvements despite higher than normal rainfall.\n\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\n\n**Nine Months Ended July 31,** |  **Change**  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands, unless otherwise stated)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **$** |  **%**  \n**Gross Profit and Gross Margin**  \nGross Profit | $ | 119,586 | $ | 129,412 | $ | (9,826 | ) | (7.6 | )%  \nGross Margin | 38.0 | % | 40.2 | %  \n  \n_Gross margin._ Our gross margin for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 was 38.0% compared to 40.2% in the nine months ended July 31, 2023. The decrease in our gross margin was primarily related to lower revenue in our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment, decreased labor efficiencies driven by the reduced revenue in our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment and inflationary increases in commercial insurance premium costs. These amounts were partially offset by improved fuel expense and lower repair and maintenance costs.\n\n28 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\n_General and administrative expenses (\"G &A\"). _G&A expenses for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 were $89.5 million, an increase of $2.3 million from $87.2 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. G&A expenses as a percent of revenue were 28.5% for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to 27.1% for the same period a year ago. The increase in G&A expenses was largely due to (1) a non-recurring charge of $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of a recent adverse court ruling related to sales tax in Washington State, as further described in [Note 13](#Commitments_and_Contingencies) in Part I, Item 1 of this report, and (2) higher labor and health insurance costs of approximately $2.7 million as a result of wage inflation. These increases were partially offset by non-cash decreases in amortization expense of $2.8 million and stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million.\n\nFor the nine months ended July 31, 2024, excluding amortization of intangible assets of $11.5 million, depreciation expense of $1.7 million, stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million and non-recurring charges of $4.1 million which include $3.5 million related to the sales tax court ruling, G&A expenses were $70.3 million (22.4% of revenue). For the nine months ended July 31, 2023, excluding amortization of intangible assets of $14.3 million, depreciation expense of $1.8 million and stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million, G&A expenses were $68.0 million (21.1% of revenue). The increase of $2.3 million was primarily due to the higher labor and increased health insurance costs as discussed above.\n\nTotal other income (expense)\n\n_Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs._ Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 was $19.7 million, down $1.6 million from $21.3 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average ABL revolver draw during the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2024 as compared to the same quarters a year ago.\n\n_Change in fair value of warrant liabilities._ During the nine months ended July 31, 2024, the Company recognized a $0.1 million gain on the fair value remeasurement of our liability-classified warrants. During the nine months ended July 31, 2023 the Company recognized a $6.6 million gain on the fair value measurement of our liability-classified warrants. The decline in the fair value remeasurement of the public warrants is due to the Company's share price trading below the exercise price as the warrants were closer to expiring in December 2023. On December 6, 2023, we announced the expiration of the Company's 13,017,677 warrants. As such they were no longer recognized as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 31, 2024.\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n_Income tax expense._ For the nine months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate was 38.5% and 19.5%, respectively. The comparability of effective tax rates between both periods was primarily impacted by (1) higher excess tax deficiencies from share-based compensation exercise and vesting activity in the nine months ended July 31, 2024, (2) the warrants fair value activity in the nine months ended July 31, 2023, as it is not recognized for tax purposes, (3) increases in the UK corporate income tax rate to 25% and (4) the expiration of the capital allowances super deduction in the UK in fiscal 2024.\n\n29 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income/(Loss)**\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company moved certain assets and associated revenues and expenses, which were previously categorized in the Company's Other activities, into the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment in order to better align its placement with the manner in which the Company allocates its resources and measures performance. As a result, segment results for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. For further discussion, see [Note 18](#Note_17_Segment_Reporting) in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information. In addition, in order to appropriately distribute the use of corporate resources and better align measures with segment performance, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company is no longer adding back intercompany allocations to segment Adjusted EBITDA.

Net income for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment was $3.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, versus net income of $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment was $20.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, down $2.6 million from $22.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2023. The decrease in net income and Adjusted EBITDA were primarily attributable to lower revenue volumes due to factors described above in Results of Operations three months ended July 31, 2024.\n\nNet loss for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment was $4.3 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024, versus net income of $3.8 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment was $48.0 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024, down $10.8 million from $58.8 million for the same period in fiscal 2023. The decrease in net income and Adjusted EBITDA were primarily attributable to lower revenue volumes, decreased labor efficiencies driven by the reduced revenue, and inflationary increases in commercial insurance.\n\n_U.K. Operations._ Net income for our U.K. Operations segment was $0.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, versus net income of $1.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.K. Operations segment was $4.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, down $0.6 million from $4.8 million from the same period in fiscal 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to lower volumes caused by a general slowdown in commercial construction work, mostly due to the impact from high interest rates and non-recurring charges of $0.3 million that were partially offset by reductions in repair costs. Apart from the non-recuring charges, the change in adjusted EBITDA was impacted by the same items.\n\nNet income for our U.K. Operations segment was $2.4 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024, versus net income of $2.4 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.K. Operations segment was $11.6 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024, up $0.6 million from $11.0 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. The increases were primarily attributable to the year-over-year improvement in revenue and reductions in fuel and repair costs.\n\n_U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services._ Net income for our U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment was $3.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, versus net income of $4.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment was $7.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, down $0.2 million from $7.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2023. The decrease in net income was attributable to the inflationary increases in labor, higher corporate allocations and slightly higher depreciation, partially offset by the increase in revenue as described above. Apart from the slight increase in depreciation, the change in adjusted EBITDA was impacted by the same items.\n\nNet income for our U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment was $8.5 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024, versus net income of $9.5 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment was $18.9 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024, down $0.1 from $19.0 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by adverse weather impacts in the first quarter on labor efficiencies, coupled with inflationary increases in commercial insurance and labor costs, higher corporate allocations and slightly higher depreciation, partially offset by an increase in revenue as described above. Apart from the slight increase in depreciation, the change in adjusted EBITDA was impacted by the same items.\n\n_Other._ There was no net income for Other activities for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to a net income of $0.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The change in net income is related to the change in warrant liability, as discussed above.\n\nNet income for Other activities was $0.1 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024, compared to a net income of $6.6 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. The change in net income is related to the change in warrant liability, as discussed above.\n\n31 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n**_Overview_**\n\nOur capital structure is primarily a combination of (1) permanent financing, represented by stockholders’ equity; (2) zero-dividend convertible perpetual preferred stock; (3) long-term financing represented by our Senior Notes (as defined below) and (4) short-term financing under our ABL Facility (as defined below). Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and access to our revolving credit facility under our ABL Facility (as defined below), which provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $225.0 million, subject to a borrowing base limitation. We use our liquidity and capital resources to: (1) finance working capital requirements; (2) service our indebtedness; (3) purchase property, plant and equipment; and (4) finance strategic acquisitions. As of July 31, 2024, we had $26.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $210.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility (as defined below), providing total available liquidity of $236.3 million.\n\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or pay down borrowings on the outstanding balance of our ABL Facility or Senior Notes using cash on hand. Such repayments, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\n\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, potential acquisitions and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity could result in dilution to our stockholders and the incurrence of additional debt could restrict our operations.\n\n**_Material Cash Requirements_**\n\nOur principal uses of cash historically have been to fund operating activities and working capital, purchases of property and equipment, strategic acquisitions, fund payments due under facility operating and finance leases, share repurchases and to meet debt service requirements.\n\nOur working capital surplus as of July 31, 2024 was $35.9 million. We are in compliance with our debt covenants and believe that we have sufficient working capital to meet our material cash requirements.\n\nThe amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects. In response to changing economic conditions, we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them (either up or down) to match our actual performance. Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $37.5 million and $43.2 million, respectively. See \"Cash Flow\" discussion below for more information.\n\nTo service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of borrowings under the ABL Facility and/or other debt and equity financing alternatives available to us, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and conditions in the global credit and capital markets, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and given the current state of the capital markets, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the ABL Facility will be adequate to service our debt and meet our future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. See \"Senior Notes and ABL Facility\" discussion below for more information.\n\n32 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Future Contractual Obligations_**\n\nFor information regarding our future contractual obligations, see the MD&A discussion included in Item 7 of Part II of our [Annual Report](http://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1703956/000143774924001415/bbpp20231031_10k.htm). \n\n**_Senior Notes and ABL Facility_**\n\nThe table below is a summary of the composition of the Company’s debt balances as of July 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023:\n\n**July 31,** |  **October 31,**  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands)_ |  **Interest Rates** |  **Maturities** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nABL Facility - short term |  Varies |  June 2028 | $ | - | $ | 18,954  \nSenior notes - all long term |  6.00% |  February 2026 | 375,000 | 375,000  \nTotal debt, gross | 375,000 | 393,954  \nLess: Unamortized deferred financing costs offsetting long term debt | (2,088 | ) | (3,132 | )  \nLess: Current portion | - | (18,954 | )  \nLong term debt, net of unamortized deferred financing costs | $ | 372,912 | $ | 371,868  \n  \nOn January 28, 2021, Brundage-Bone Concrete Pumping Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Issuer\") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (i) completed a private offering of $375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.000% senior secured second lien notes due 2026 (the \"Senior Notes\") issued pursuant to an indenture, among the Issuer, the Company, the other Guarantors (as defined below), Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee and as collateral agent (the \"Indenture\") and (ii) entered into an amended and restated ABL Facility (as subsequently amended, the \"ABL Facility\") by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as agent, sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, the other lenders party thereto, which originally provided up to $125.0 million of asset-based revolving loan commitments to the Company and the other borrowers under the ABL Facility. The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company, Concrete Pumping Intermediate Acquisition Corp. and each of the Issuer’s domestic, wholly-owned subsidiaries that is a borrower or a guarantor under the ABL Facility (collectively, the \"Guarantors\").\n\nOn June 1, 2023, the ABL Facility was amended to, among other changes, (1) increase the maximum revolver borrowings available to be drawn thereunder to $225.0 million, (2) increase the letter of credit sublimit to $22.5 million and (3) extend the maturity of the ABL Facility to the earlier of (a) June 1, 2028 or (b) the date that is 180 days prior to (i) the final stated maturity date of the Senior Notes or (ii) the date the Senior Notes become due and payable. The ABL Facility also provides for an uncommitted accordion feature under which the borrowers under the ABL Facility can, subject to specified conditions, increase the ABL Facility by up to an additional $75.0 million. The amended ABL Facility was treated as a debt modification. The Company capitalized an additional $0.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the June 1, 2023, ABL Facility amendment. The preexisting unamortized deferred costs of $1.4 million and the additional costs of $0.5 million will be amortized from June 1, 2023 through June 1, 2028.\n\nThere was no outstanding balance under the ABL Facility as of July 31, 2024 and as of that date, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In addition, as of July 31, 2024, the Company had $1.1 million in credit line reserves and a letter of credit balance of $13.9 million. As of July 31, 2024, we had $210.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility. Debt issuance costs related to revolving credit facilities are capitalized and reflected as an asset in deferred financing costs in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. The Company had debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facilities of $1.5 million as of July 31, 2024. See [Note 8](#Debt_FN) of Part I, Item I in this document for more information on the Senior Notes and ABL Facility.\n\n33 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Cash Flows**\n\nCash generated from operating activities typically reflects net income, as adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Generally, we believe our business requires a relatively low level of working capital investment due to low inventory requirements and timely customer payments due to daily billings for most of our services.\n\n_Cash flow provided by operating activities._ Net cash provided by operating activities generally reflects the cash effects of transactions and other events used in the determination of net income or loss.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended July 31, 2024 was $64.5 million. The Company had net income of $6.8 million, which included net non-cash expense items of $50.3 million. In addition, we had cash inflows related to a decrease in our working capital of $7.4 million. Cash inflows related to working capital activity include a decrease in receivables of $7.2 million, an increase in other operating liabilities of $2.1 million and a decrease in inventory of $0.3 million. These were offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in accounts payable and an increase in other operating assets of $0.6 million. The decrease in receivables is due to decreases in sales volumes during the nine months ended July 31, 2024. The decrease in accounts payable is driven by a change in timing.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended July 31, 2023 was $66.2 million. The Company had net income of $22.4 million, which included non-cash expense items of $46.5 million. In addition, we had cash outflows related to an increase in our working capital of $2.6 million. Cash outflows related to working capital activity include an increase in other operating liabilities of $4.5 million, an increase in trade receivables of $3.2 million, a decrease of $2.1 million to accounts payable, an increase in inventory of $1.0 million and an increase in other operating assets of $0.9 million. The increase in other operating liabilities is primarily related to timing of the payment of accrued interest. The Company makes semi-annual interest payments in February and August each year. The increase in trade receivables is due to stronger revenue growth. The decrease in accounts payable is driven by a change in timing.\n\n_Cash flow used in investing activities._ Net cash used in operating activities generally reflects the cash outflows for property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe used $30.0 million to fund investing activities during the nine months ended July 31, 2024. The Company used $37.5 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, which was partially offset by $7.5 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe used $35.9 million to fund investing activities during the nine months ended July 31, 2023. The Company used $43.2 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and $0.8 million for the purchase of intangible assets, which was partially offset by $8.0 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe decrease in capital expenditures of $5.7 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to the fact that we have sufficient capacity from our current fleet to meet the demand of the business going forward.\n\n_Cash flow used in financing activities_.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $24.8 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2024. Cash used in financing activities included $19.0 million in net payments under the Company's ABL Facility and $7.2 million in purchase of treasury stock, which included $4.0 million purchased under the share repurchase program and $3.2 million in outflows from the purchase of shares into treasury stock in order to fund the employee tax obligations for certain stock award vesting and stock option exercise activities.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $26.7 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2023. Cash used in financing activities included $16.4 million in net proceeds under the Company's ABL Facility and $9.7 million in purchase of treasury stock, which included $8.6 million purchased under the share repurchase program and $1.1 million in outflows from the purchase of shares into treasury stock in order to fund the employee tax obligations for certain vested stock awards.\n\n34 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Accounting and Other Reporting Matters**\n\n_**[](# \"Non-GAAP Measures\")Non-GAAP Measures (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA)**_\n\nWe calculate EBITDA by taking GAAP net income and adding back interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and adding back loss on debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation, changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities, other income, net, goodwill and intangibles impairment and other adjustments. Other adjustments include non-recurring expenses, non-cash currency gains/losses, transaction expenses and interest income. Transaction expenses represent expenses for legal, accounting, and other professionals that were engaged in the completion of various acquisitions. Transaction expenses can be volatile as they are primarily driven by the size of a specific acquisition. As such, we exclude these amounts from Adjusted EBITDA for comparability across periods.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company moved certain assets and associated revenues and expenses that were previously categorized in the Company's Other activities, into the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment in order to better align its placement with the manner in which the Company allocates its resources and measures performance. As a result, segment results for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. For further discussion, see [Note 18](#Note_17_Segment_Reporting) in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information. In addition, in order to appropriately distribute the use of corporate resources and better align measures with segment performance, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company is no longer adding back intercompany allocations to segment Adjusted EBITDA. As a result, segment results for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to our current period presentation. See the section \"Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income/(Loss)\" above for more information.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends related to our financial condition and results of operations, and as a supplemental tool for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with competitors who also present similar non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, these measures (1) are used in quarterly and annual financial reports and presentations prepared for management, our board of directors and investors, and (2) help management to determine incentive compensation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as comparative measures.\n\n35 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Three Months Ended July 31,** |  **Nine Months Ended July 31,**  \n---|---  \n_(in thousands)_ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Consolidated**  \nNet income | $ | 7,560 | $ | 10,336 | $ | 6,780 | $ | 22,399  \nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs | 6,318 | 7,066 | 19,744 | 21,285  \nIncome tax expense | 3,081 | 3,318 | 4,250 | 5,427  \nDepreciation and amortization | 14,491 | 14,707 | 42,827 | 43,877  \nEBITDA | 31,450 | 35,427 | 73,601 | 92,988  \nStock-based compensation | 644 | 934 | 1,917 | 3,138  \nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities | - | (911 | ) | (130 | ) | (6,639 | )  \nOther expense (income), net | (276 | ) | (262 | ) | (360 | ) | (296 | )  \nOther adjustments(1) | (180 | ) | (272 | ) | 3,439 | (396 | )  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 31,638 | $ | 34,916 | $ | 78,467 | $ | 88,795  \n**U.S. Concrete Pumping**  \nNet income (loss) | $ | 3,535 | $ | 3,823 | $ | (4,309 | ) | $ | 3,785  \nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs | 5,585 | 6,337 | 17,577 | 19,163  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) | 1,162 | 1,421 | (426 | ) | 1,339  \nDepreciation and amortization | 9,874 | 10,714 | 30,374 | 32,108  \nEBITDA | 20,156 | 22,295 | 43,216 | 56,395  \nStock-based compensation | 644 | 934 | 1,917 | 3,138  \nOther expense (income), net | (252 | ) | (257 | ) | (279 | ) | (273 | )  \nOther adjustments(1) | (448 | ) | (301 | ) | 3,175 | (489 | )  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 20,100 | $ | 22,671 | $ | 48,029 | $ | 58,771  \n**U.K. Operations**  \nNet income | $ | 905 | $ | 1,616 | $ | 2,433 | $ | 2,449  \nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs | 733 | 729 | 2,167 | 2,122  \nIncome tax expense | 436 | 545 | 1,210 | 831  \nDepreciation and amortization | 1,907 | 1,879 | 5,564 | 5,555  \nEBITDA | 3,981 | 4,769 | 11,374 | 10,957  \nOther expense (income), net | (21 | ) | (6 | ) | (71 | ) | (23 | )  \nOther adjustments | 268 | 29 | 264 | 93  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 4,228 | $ | 4,792 | $ | 11,567 | $ | 11,027  \n**U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services**  \nNet income | $ | 3,120 | $ | 3,986 | $ | 8,526 | $ | 9,526  \nIncome tax expense | 1,483 | 1,352 | 3,466 | 3,257  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,710 | 2,114 | 6,889 | 6,214  \nEBITDA | 7,313 | 7,452 | 18,881 | 18,997  \nOther expense (income), net | (3 | ) | 1 | (10 | ) | -  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 7,310 | $ | 7,453 | $ | 18,871 | $ | 18,997  \n**Other**  \nNet income | $ | - | $ | 911 | $ | 130 | $ | 6,639  \nEBITDA | - | 911 | 130 | 6,639  \nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities | - | (911 | ) | (130 | ) | (6,639 | )  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | - | $ | - | $ | - | $ | -  \n1 Other adjustments include the adjustment for non-recurring expenses, non-cash currency gains/losses, transaction expenses and interest income.

These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of\noperation, cash flows, strategies and prospects, and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These forward-looking statements may be identified\nby terminology such as “likely,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue,” or the negative of\nsuch terms and other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are\nreasonable, we cannot guarantee future results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no\nobligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their\npotential effects. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and other factors that may cause the actual\nresults, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and\nuncertainties include, but are not limited to, the items in the following list, which also summarizes some of the principal risks relating to the Company and its business:\n● the adverse impact of inflation, including increases in fuel costs, global economic conditions and events related to these conditions;\n● general economic and business conditions, which may affect demand for commercial, infrastructure, and residential construction and adverse effects of major\nendemics or pandemics on our business;\n● our ability to successfully implement our operating strategy;\n● our ability to successfully identify, manage and integrate acquisitions;\n● our ability to maintain effective internal controls necessary to provide reliable financial reports;\n● governmental requirements and initiatives, including those related to mortgage lending, financing or deductions, funding for public or infrastructure\nconstruction, land usage, and environmental, health, and safety matters;\n● seasonal and inclement weather conditions, which impede the installation of ready-mixed concrete;\n● the cyclical nature of, and changes in, the real estate and construction markets, including pricing changes by our competitors;\n● our ability to maintain favorable relationships with third parties who supply us with equipment and essential supplies;\n● our ability to retain key personnel and maintain satisfactory labor relations;\n● disruptions, uncertainties or volatility in the credit markets that may limit our, our suppliers’ and our customers’ access to capital;\n● personal injury, property damage, results of litigation and other claims and insurance coverage issues;\n● our substantial indebtedness and the restrictions imposed on us by the terms of our indebtedness;\n● the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and financial condition;\n● other factors as described below in the section entitled “Risk Factors.”\n1\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nConcrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Thornton (near Denver), Colorado. We refer to Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. as\nthe “Company,” “CPH,”, “us”, “we” or “our” in this Annual Report, and these designations include our subsidiaries unless we state otherwise.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 500 E. 84th Ave., Suite A-5, Thornton, Colorado, 80229.

Since then, the Company has expanded across the\nU.S. and U.K. through more than 70 strategic acquisitions. Eco-Pan was founded in 1999 and was acquired by CPH in 2014. In November 2016, we entered the U.K.\nmarket through the acquisition of Camfaud. In recent years, we have successfully executed on our acquisition strategy, including (1) our fiscal 2022 acquisition of Pioneer\nConcrete Pumping Service, Inc. (“Pioneer”), which provided us with complementary assets and operations in both Georgia and Texas, and (2) our acquisition of Coastal\nCarolina Concrete Pumping, Inc. (\"Coastal\") in August of 2022, which expanded our operations in the Carolinas and Florida.\nConcrete pumping is a highly specialized method of concrete placement that requires skilled operators to position a truck-mounted, fully-articulating boom for\nprecise delivery of ready-mix concrete from mixer trucks to placing crews on a construction job site. In addition, given the rising awareness of environmental factors, proper\nconcrete washout handling is an important area of focus for our Company. We believe that our large fleet of specialized pumping equipment, washout pans and trucks, and\nhighly-trained operators enable us to be the trusted provider of concrete placement and concrete waste management solutions to our customers. We deliver and facilitate\nsubstantial labor cost savings, shortened concrete placement times, enhanced worksite safety, and efficient concrete washout containment, and thereby help improve the\noverall quality of construction projects. As of October 31, 2023, we operated a fleet of approximately 1,580 units of equipment, with approximately 1,720 employees and\napproximately 150 locations globally.\nWith 40 years of experience, we believe we are the only nationally-scaled provider of concrete pumping services in the U.S. and the U.K., with the most\ncomprehensive and reliable fleet and highly-skilled operators to provide quality service. We are especially equipped to support large and technically complex construction\nprojects, which generally command higher price points than smaller projects. In addition, we have actively focused our business on commercial and infrastructure\nconstruction projects, while continuing to pursue profitable residential opportunities. Our fleet is capable of handling multiple large projects concurrently and can be\ndeployed on short-notice across the U.S. and the U.K., thereby allowing us to efficiently allocate resources depending on market conditions to more profitable markets. Our\ncomplementary Eco-Pan business provides concrete washout services to customers. We plan to continue establishing additional Eco-Pan locations across the U.S. and the\nU.K., and further penetrate our existing concrete pumping customer base by cross-selling our Eco-Pan services.\nAs of October 31, 2023, we estimate our share of the concrete pumping market to be approximately 17% in the U.S. and approximately 30% in the U.K., based on\nfleet size. In the U.S. and U.K. markets, we serve a large and diverse customer base and as of October 31, 2023, our top ten customers represented less than 10% of our total\nrevenue and had an average tenure of more than 20 years.\n2\nTable of Contents\nSegments\nWe operate through the following reportable segments:\nU.S. Concrete Pumping: Our U.S. concrete pumping services segment represented 72% of our total revenue for the year ended October 31, 2023, and services from\nthis segment are primarily provided under our Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands, which as of October 31, 2023 operated a total fleet of approximately 1,060\nequipment units from a diversified footprint of approximately 100 locations across 21 states. We provide operated concrete pumping services, for which customers are billed\non a negotiated time and volume basis based on the duration of the job and yards of concrete pumped. Additional charges (such as a fuel surcharge and travel costs) are\nfrequently added based on specific project requirements. Typically, we send a single operator with each concrete pump. We do not take ownership of the concrete and thus\nhave minimal inventory or product liability risk. We typically do not engage in fixed-bid work or have surety bonding requirements and operate a daily fee-based revenue\nmodel regardless of overall construction project completion.\nU.S. Concrete Waste Management Services: Our U.S. concrete waste management services segment represented 14% of our total revenue for the year ended\nOctober 31, 2023. Operating under our Eco-Pan brand, with approximately 115 trucks and over 10,000 custom metal pans or containers for construction sites from 19\nlocations in the U.S. as of October 31, 2023, we are a leading provider of concrete waste management services in the U.S, providing a full-service, route-based, cost-\neffective, regulation-compliant solution to manage environmental issues caused by concrete washout. We charge a fixed fee that includes (1) the round-trip delivery and\npickup of watertight pans / containers, (2) environmental disposal of concrete washout and (3) a specified number of days the pans / containers can be used for. This\nprovides a turnkey solution to the customer compared to the alternatives of bagging the waste concrete, pouring it into an on-site lined pit, or disposing of it into trash\ndumpsters and arranging for a pick-up. To the extent that the pans or containers are held at the job site for an extended number of days or irregular waste is found in the pan,\nwe charge incremental fees. Our trucks are designed to allow for the pick-up and re-delivery of multiple pans, leading to significant incremental efficiencies as route\ndensities increase.\nU.K. Operations: Our U.K. operations segment represented 14% of our total revenue for the year ended October 31, 2023, and consisted of concrete pumping and\nconcrete waste management services. Our concrete pumping services are primarily provided through either our Camfaud brand (operated pumping services) or our Premier\nConcrete Pumping brand (rental of pumping equipment without an operator). Mobile equipment is charged to customers under a minimum hire rate, which is typically five\nto eight hours. Our concrete pumping business in the U.K. is comprised of a fleet of approximately 400 equipment units that are serviced from approximately 30 locations\nas of October 31, 2023. In addition, the results of our concrete waste management operations under our Eco-Pan brand name in the U.K. are included in this segment. Our\nEco-Pan business in the U.K. is operated from a shared Camfaud location as of October 31, 2023. We bill our customers for our Eco-Pan services in the same manner as our\nU.S. Eco-Pan services.\nCompetitive Environment\nThe concrete pumping industry is highly fragmented in both the U.S. and the U.K. In the U.S., we believe there are approximately 1,000 industry participants, the\nmajority of which operate with an average of five to ten pumps each. A limited number have a multi-regional presence (average of 50-60 pumps) and no other companies\nhave a national presence. We believe many industry participants are undercapitalized, utilize aged equipment and operate only smaller and significantly fewer boom pumps.\nIn a typical geographic market, we generally compete with only one or two other concrete pumping companies that can perform the larger and more complex projects that\nwe typically target.\nIn the concrete waste management industry, we compete with local operators who may have a small number of washout pans but are not capable of offering\nservices across the U.S. We believe we are the only operator of scale with a national footprint in this industry and estimate that there is only one competitor on a national\nlevel. While the technology underlying the washout pans is less sophisticated than that for a concrete pump, we believe having the capacity and route density that Eco-Pan\nhas achieved is a differentiator in terms of profitability. Our U.K. operations segment is the pioneer of the concrete waste management service in the U.K. and as such, we\nare not aware of any equivalent competitor in the U.K.\n3\nTable of Contents\nEquipment\nOur fleet is operated by approximately 1,010 experienced employees as of October 31, 2023, each of whom is required to complete rigorous training and safety\nprograms. In addition, we have approximately 160 skilled mechanics who perform in-house equipment servicing. As of October 31, 2023, we owned 100% of our fleet\nconsisting of approximately 930 boom pumps, ranging in size from 16 to 66 meters, 90 placing booms, 20 telebelts, 300 stationary pumps, and 115 waste management\ntrucks. As of October 31, 2023, the average age of our fleet was approximately 9 years old and most of our equipment had useful lives of 20 to 25 years.\nCustomers\nWe serve a base of approximately 12,000 customers (often with several projects per customer) across the U.S. and the U.K. and have an approximate 90%\ncustomer retention rate based on our top 500 customers and ~100% customer retention rate of our top 100 customers as of October 31, 2023. In addition, as of October 31,\n2023, our top ten customers represented less than 10% of our total revenue and had an average tenure of more than 20 years. Our customer composition is largely dependent\non geographic location and general economic and construction market trends within individual operating markets. We actively monitor regional trends and target customers\nin fast-growing markets through our extensive geographic footprint and knowledge of the local construction markets in each region in which we operate.\nOur customer base consists of general contractors or concrete contractors that span across the commercial, infrastructure and residential end markets. We also sell\nreplacement parts to regional operators that lack the capital and scale to independently maintain a sufficiently stocked replacement parts inventory. Our contractual\narrangements with customers are typically on a project-to-project purchase order basis.\nSuppliers\nWe primarily purchase pumping equipment, replacement parts, and fuel for our day-to-day operations. Concrete pumping equipment is primarily sourced from\nthree suppliers – Schwing, Putzmeister, and Alliance. There are a number of other suppliers as well and we are not solely dependent upon any single one. We believe we are\nthe concrete pumping industry’s largest consumer of concrete pumping supplies and, as such, have significant purchasing efficiencies. We typically purchase fuel in bulk at\nfavorable prices and utilize onsite fuel storage facilities.\nEmployees\nAs of October 31, 2023, we had approximately 1,720 employees across the U.S. and the U.K., of which approximately 1,170 are highly-skilled equipment\noperators and mechanics, approximately 230 are managers, approximately 50 are in sales, and approximately 70 are dispatchers. The remaining employees include\nadministrative support, corporate functions, and laborers. Our employees have an average tenure of approximately four years for pump operators. Additionally, our regional\nmanagers have, on average, approximately 32 years of experience in the concrete pumping industry. We maintain a highly sophisticated, industry recognized training\nprogram, which ensures all operators can meet the requirements of any project. Operators are trained in concrete pumping as well as in basic mechanical repair, while shop\nmanagers are trained in inspection and maintenance of all critical truck systems.\nApproximately 120 employees in CPH’s workforce are unionized across California, Oregon and Washington. These individuals are represented by the International\nUnion of Operating Engineers (“IUOE”) under three separate collective bargaining agreements. We have historically maintained favorable relations with the IUOE and have\nnot experienced any significant disputes, disagreements, strikes or work stoppages.\nSafety\nWe maintain an active safety program, including an in-house corporate safety department and a designated safety trainer at each branch. As part of our safety\nmanagement program, we track key safety performance indicators at each branch location to monitor safety performance and seek to implement corrective actions when\nneeded. Over the last two years, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) has remained better than industry averages.\n4\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local and environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into air or water,\nthe management, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous substances and wastes, the responsibility to investigate and clean up contamination, and occupational\nhealth and safety. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and the failure to have or to\ncomply with the terms and conditions of required permits. We are not aware of any material instances of non-compliance with respect to environmental regulations.\nAvailable Information\nWe make our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished\npursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably\npracticable after we file or furnish the materials electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Company’s Business and Operations\nOur business is cyclical in nature and a slowdown in economic activity, especially as it pertains to construction spending, has in the past and could in the future\nnegatively impact our financial results.\nSubstantially all of our customer base comes from the commercial, infrastructure and residential construction markets. Global economic challenges including\ninflation, increased fuel costs, supply-chain disruptions, and adverse labor market conditions have caused macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility in markets where we\noperate, and as a result of these challenges, (1) we have experienced negative impacts to our gross margins where we have not been able to fully pass these cost increase\nfactors on to our customers and (2) some of our customers’ projects have been delayed or potentially cancelled. Although economic conditions have shown signs of\nimprovement in recent months, any further worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in construction expenditures and/or investments could cause weakness in our\nend markets, cause declines in construction and industrial activity, and materially adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nThe following factors, among others, may cause weakness in our end markets, either temporarily or long-term:\n● the depth and duration of an economic slowdown and lack of availability of credit;\n● lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic factors, which have resulted in a tight labor market and impacted supply chains, our operations\nand our customers’ operations;\n● uncertainty regarding general or regional economic conditions;\n● reductions in corporate spending for plants and facilities or government spending for infrastructure projects;\n● reductions in commercial and residential construction spending activity;\n● the cyclical nature of our customers’ businesses, particularly those operating in the commercial, infrastructure and residential construction sectors;\n● an increase in the cost of construction materials;\n● a decrease in investment in certain of our key geographic markets;\n● changes in interest rates and lending standards;\n● an overcapacity in the businesses that drive the need for construction;\n● adverse weather conditions, which may temporarily affect a particular region or regions;\n● reduced construction activity in our end markets;\n● terrorism or hostilities involving the U.S. or the U.K.;\n● change in structural construction designs of buildings (e.g., wood versus concrete);\n● risks of political or economic instability; and\n● oversupply of equipment or new entrants into the market area resulting in greater competitive activity.\nA downturn in any of our end markets in one or more of our geographic markets caused by these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is seasonal and subject to adverse weather conditions.\nSince our business is primarily conducted outdoors, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions affect our business. Adverse\nweather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms, cold weather, snow, and heavy or sustained rainfall, reduce construction activity, restrict the demand for our\nproducts and services, and impede our ability to deliver and pump concrete efficiently or at all. In addition, during periods of extended adverse weather or other operational\ndelays, we may elect to continue to pay certain hourly employees to maintain our workforce, which may adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, severe\ndrought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production. Consequently, these events have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur revenue and operating results have varied historically from period to period and any unexpected periods of decline could result in an overall decline in our\navailable cash flows.\nOur revenue and operating results have varied historically from period to period and may continue to do so. We have identified below certain of the factors that\nhave in the past and may in the future cause our revenue and operating results to vary:\n● seasonal weather patterns in the construction industry on which we rely, with activity tending to be lowest in the winter and spring;\n● the timing of expenditures for maintaining existing equipment, new equipment and the disposal of used equipment;\n● changes in demand for our services or the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions, competition or other factors;\n● changes in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt, and the overall level of our debt;\n● fluctuations in fuel costs;\n● general economic conditions in the markets where we operate;\n● the cyclical nature of our customers’ businesses;\n● price changes in response to competitive factors;\n● other cost fluctuations, such as costs for employee-related compensation and benefits;\n● labor shortages, work stoppages or other labor difficulties and labor issues in trades on which our business may be dependent in particular regions;\n● potential enactment of new legislation affecting our operations or labor relations;\n● timing of acquisitions and new branch openings and related costs;\n● possible unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies and difficulties associated with integrating acquired companies into our existing operations;\n● changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar (“USD”) and Great Britain pound sterling (“GBP”);\n● potential increased demand from our customers to develop and provide new technological services in our business to meet changing customer preferences;\n● our ability to control costs and maintain quality;\n● our effectiveness in integrating new locations and acquisitions; and\n● possible write-offs or exceptional charges due to changes in applicable accounting standards, reorganizations or restructurings, obsolete or damaged\nequipment or the refinancing of our existing debt.\nAccordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year.\nFurthermore, negative trends in the concrete pumping and waste management industries or in our geographic markets could have material adverse effects on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is highly competitive and competition may increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe concrete pumping industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by several competitors, ranging from\nlarger regional companies to small, independent businesses with a limited fleet and geographic scope of operations. Some of our principal competitors may have more\nflexible capital structures or may have greater name recognition in one or more of our geographic markets. We generally compete on the basis of, among other things,\nquality and breadth of service, expertise, reliability, price and the size, quality and availability of our fleet of pumping equipment, which is significantly affected by the level\nof our capital expenditures. If we are required to reduce or delay capital expenditures for any reason, including due to restrictions contained in, or debt service payments\nrequired by, our credit facilities or otherwise, the ability to replace our fleet or the age of our fleet may put us at a disadvantage to our competitors and adversely impact our\nability to generate revenue. In addition, our industry may be subject to competitive price decreases in the future, particularly during cyclical downturns in our end markets,\nwhich can adversely affect revenue, profitability and cash flow. We may encounter increased competition from existing competitors or new market entrants in the future,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n7\nTable of Contents\nWe are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment for our business.\nWe depend on a small group of key manufacturers of concrete pumping equipment to sell equipment to us. We have historically relied primarily on three suppliers\nand we cannot provide assurance that our favorable working relationships with our suppliers will continue in the future or that they will continue to provide high-quality\nproducts, service and support. Any deterioration in the quality of such products, service or support could result in additional maintenance costs and operational issues.\nIn addition, the concrete industry has historically been subject to periods of supply shortages, particularly in a strong economy or due to macroeconomic supply\nchain issues. We cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of changes in the economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses. Insolvency,\nfinancial difficulties, strategic changes or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us, whether satisfactorily or at\nall. Further, such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts\nwith us. Termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers, or interruption of our access to concrete pumping equipment, pipe or other supplies, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs the average fleet age increases, our offerings may not be as attractive to potential customers and our operating costs may materially increase, impacting our results\nof operations.\nAs our equipment ages, the cost of maintaining such equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time or amount of use, will likely increase. We estimate\nthat our fleet assets generally will have a useful life of up to 25 years depending on the size of the machine, hours in service, yardage pumped, and, in certain instances,\nother circumstances unique to an asset. We manage our fleet of equipment according to the wear and tear that a specific machine or type of equipment is expected to\nexperience over its useful life. As of October 31, 2023, the average age of our concrete pumping equipment was approximately nine years. If the average age of our\nequipment increases, whether as a result of our inability to access sufficient capital to maintain or replace equipment in a timely manner or otherwise, our investment in the\nmaintenance, parts and repair for individual pieces of equipment may exceed the book value or replacement value of that equipment. We cannot provide assurance that costs\nof maintenance will not materially increase in the future. Any material increase in such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. Additionally, as our equipment ages, it may become less attractive to potential customers, thus decreasing our ability to effectively compete for new\nbusiness.\nThe costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase, requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a\ntimely basis.\nThe cost of new equipment for use in our concrete pumping fleet has increased and could further increase due to increased material costs to our suppliers or other\nfactors beyond our control. Such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods. Furthermore,\nchanges in technology or customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe sell used equipment on a regular basis. Our fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect.\nWe continuously evaluate our fleet of equipment as we seek to optimize our vehicle size and capabilities for our end markets in multiple locations. We therefore\nseek to sell used equipment on a regular basis. The market value of any given piece of equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market\nvalue of used equipment depends on several factors, including:\n● the market price for comparable new equipment;\n● the time of year that it is sold;\n● the supply of similar used equipment on the market;\n● the existence and capacities of different sales outlets;\n● the age of the equipment, and the amount of usage of such equipment relative to its age, at the time it is sold;\n● worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment;\n● the effect of advances and changes in technology in new equipment models;\n● changing perception of residual value of used equipment by the Company’s suppliers; and\n● general economic conditions.\nWe include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the net book value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions\nregarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used concrete pumping\nequipment at prices that fall significantly below our expectations or in lesser quantities than we anticipate could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nWe have in the past and may in the future incur impairment charges as a result of an impairment to goodwill or intangible assets, which would negatively impact our\noperating results.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations.\nWe assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets,\nnegative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. An impairment of our goodwill may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic drove a sustained decline in our stock price and a deterioration in general economic\nconditions, resulting in us recording goodwill and intangibles impairment charges totaling $57.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. At October 31, 2023, we had\nremaining recorded goodwill of $221.5 million related to multiple acquisitions.\nIf we are unable to collect on contracts with a significant number of customers, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe have billing arrangements with a majority of our customers that provide for payment on agreed terms after our services are provided. If we are unable to\nmanage credit risk issues adequately, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses could increase significantly\nabove their low historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected. Further, delinquencies and credit losses increased during the last recession and\ngenerally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions.\nFluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business.\nFuel costs represent a significant portion of our operating expenses and we are dependent upon fuel to transport and operate our equipment. We have in the past and\ncould in the future be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs of transporting equipment to and from job sites\nand higher costs to operate our concrete pumps and other equipment. Although we are able to pass through the impact of fuel price charges to most of our customers, there\nis often a lag before such pass-through arrangements are reflected in our operating results and there may be a limit to how much of any fuel price increases we can pass onto\nour customers. Any such limits may adversely affect our results of operations.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on access to our branch facilities to service our customers and maintain and store our equipment, and natural disasters and other developments could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our primary branch facilities in the U.S. and U.K., respectively, to store, service and maintain our fleet. These facilities contain most of the\nspecialized equipment we require to service our fleet, in addition to the extensive secure storage areas needed for a significant number of large vehicles. If any of our\nfacilities were to sustain significant damage or become unavailable to us for any reason, including natural disasters, our operations could be disrupted, which could in turn\nadversely affect our relationships with our customers and our results of operations and cash flow. Any limitation on our access to facilities as a result of any breach of, or\ndispute under, our leases could also disrupt and adversely affect our operations. In addition, if natural disasters such as forest fires were to cause significant disruptions to\nthe construction projects where we focus our business, our operations could be disrupted, which could in turn materially adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nDue to the material portion of our business conducted in currency other than U.S. dollars, we have significant foreign currency risk.\nOur consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP, and we report, and will continue to report, our results in U.S. dollars. Some of our\noperations are conducted by subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and the results of operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries are recorded in the relevant\nforeign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars. Any change in the value of the pound sterling against the U.S. dollar during a given financial reporting period would\nresult in a foreign currency loss or gain on the translation of U.S. dollar denominated revenues and costs. The exchange rates between the pound sterling against the U.S.\ndollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may fluctuate significantly in the future. Consequently, our reported earnings has in the past and could in the future\nfluctuate materially as a result of foreign exchange translation gains or losses and may not be comparable from period to period.\nAcquisitions and expansions into new markets may result in significant transaction expense and expose us to risks associated with entering new markets and\nintegrating new or acquired operations.\nWe may encounter risks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience. New operations require significant capital expenditures\nand may initially have a negative impact on our short-term cash flow, net income and results of operations, or may never become profitable.\nIn addition, our industry is highly fragmented, and we expect to consider acquisition opportunities when we believe they would enhance our business and financial\nperformance. However, acquisitions may impose significant strains on our management, operating systems and financial resources, and could experience unanticipated\nintegration issues. The pursuit and integration of acquisitions has in the past and can continue to require substantial attention from our senior management, which will limit\nthe amount of time they have available to devote to our existing operations. Our ability to realize the expected benefits from any future acquisitions depends in large part on\nour ability to integrate and consolidate the new operations with our existing operations in a timely and effective manner. Future acquisitions could also result in the\nincurrence of substantial amounts of indebtedness and contingent liabilities (including environmental, employee benefits and safety and health liabilities), accumulation of\ngoodwill that may become impaired, and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Any significant diversion of management’s attention from our\nexisting operations, the loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business, any major difficulties encountered in the opening of start-up locations or the\nintegration of acquired operations or any associated increases in indebtedness, liabilities or expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings or profits from acquisitions.\nWe have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years that we believe present revenue, profit and cost-saving synergy opportunities. However, the integration\nof recent or future acquisitions may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the revenue, profit and cost synergies that we expected at the time or currently expect\nwithin the anticipated time frame or at all. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses or unforeseen liabilities in connection with the integration of acquired businesses.\nWhile we anticipate that certain expenses will be incurred, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed our estimates. Accordingly, the expected\nbenefits of any acquisition may be offset by costs or delays incurred in integrating the businesses. Failure of recent or future acquisitions to meet our expectations and be\nintegrated successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n10\nTable of Contents\nDisruptions in our information technology systems due to cyber security threats, incidents or other factors could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our\noperations and adversely affect our operating results, and unauthorized access to customer information on our systems could adversely affect our relationships with our\ncustomers or result in liability.\nOur information technology systems, including our enterprise resource planning system, facilitate our ability to monitor and control our assets and operations and\nadjust to changing market conditions and customer needs. Any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the\nmagnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our assets and operations and adjust to changing\nmarket conditions in a timely manner. Many of our business records at most of our branches are still maintained manually, and loss of those records as a result of facility\ndamage, personnel changes or otherwise could also cause such disruptions. In addition, because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and\nbusinesses, our failure to appropriately safeguard the security of the data it holds, whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our\nreputation or give rise to legal liabilities, leading to lower revenue, increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nWe have taken important steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis.\nHowever, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Furthermore, instability in the\nfinancial markets as a result of terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks, or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are exposed to liability claims on a continuing basis, which may exceed the level of our insurance or not be covered at all, and this could have a material adverse\neffect on our operating performance.\nOur business exposes us to claims for personal injury, death or property damage resulting from the use of the equipment we operate, rent, sell, service or repair and\nfrom injuries caused in motor vehicle or other accidents in which our personnel are involved. Our business also exposes us to workers’ compensation claims and other\nemployment-related claims. We carry comprehensive insurance, subject to deductibles, at levels we believe are sufficient to cover existing and future claims; however,\nfuture claims may exceed the level of our insurance, and our insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Certain types of claims,\nsuch as claims for punitive damages, are not covered by our insurance. In addition, we are self-insured for the deductibles on our policies and have established reserves for\nincurred but not reported claims. If actual claims exceed our reserves, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected. Whether or\nnot we are covered by insurance, certain claims may generate negative publicity, which may lead to lower revenues, as well as additional similar claims being filed.\nOur business is subject to significant operating risks and hazards that have in the past and could in the future result in personal injury or damage or destruction to\nproperty, which could result in losses or liabilities to the Company.\nConstruction sites are potentially dangerous workplaces and often put our employees and others in close proximity with mechanized equipment and moving\nvehicles. Our equipment has been involved in workplace incidents and incidents involving mobile operators of our equipment in transit in the past and may also be involved\nin such incidents in the future.\nOur profitability and relationships with our customers is dependent on our safety record. If serious accidents or fatalities occur, regardless of whether we were at\nfault, or our safety record were to deteriorate, we may be ineligible to bid on certain work, be exposed to possible litigation, and existing service arrangements could be\nterminated, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Adverse experiences with hazards and\nclaims could have a negative effect on our reputation with our existing or potential new customers and our prospects for future work.\nIn any concrete construction environment, our workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction\nsites, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, hurricanes, adverse weather conditions and flooding. Operating hazards have in the past and could in the\nfuture cause personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment, environmental damage, performance delays, monetary losses or legal\nliability.\n11\nTable of Contents\nWe have operations throughout the United States and the United Kingdom, which subjects us to multiple federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Moreover, we\noperate at times as a government contractor or subcontractor which subjects us to additional laws, regulations, and contract provisions. Changes in law, regulations,\ngovernment contract provisions, or other legal requirements, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs and have other negative impacts\non our business.\nEach of our sites exposes us to a host of different local laws and regulations. These requirements address multiple aspects of our operations, such as worker safety,\nconsumer rights, privacy, employee benefits, antitrust, emissions regulations and may also impact other areas of our business, such as pricing. In addition, government\ncontracts and subcontracts are subject to a wide range of requirements not applicable in the purely commercial context, such as extensive auditing and disclosure\nrequirements; anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and anti-gratuity rules; political campaign contribution and lobbying limitations; and small and/or disadvantaged business\npreferences. Even when a government contractor has reasonable policies and practices in place to address these risks and requirements, it is still possible for problems to\narise. Moreover, government contracts or subcontracts are generally riskier than commercial contracts, because, when problems arise, the adverse consequences can be\nsevere, including civil false claims (which can involve penalties and treble damages), suspension and debarment, and even criminal prosecution. Moreover, the requirements\nof laws, regulations, and government contract provisions are often different in different jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements, or any material failure by us to comply\nwith them, can increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, reduce our business, require significant management time and attention and generally otherwise impact\nour operations in adverse ways.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. If we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated, our\nliquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur facilities and operations are subject to comprehensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental\nprotection and health and safety. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, occupational safety, employee relations, the discharge of substances into the air,\nwater and land, the handling, storage, transport, use and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup of properties affected by pollutants. If we violate\nenvironmental or safety laws or regulations, we may be required to implement corrective actions and could be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties or other\nsanctions. We cannot assure you that we will not have to make significant capital or operating expenditures in the future in order to comply with applicable laws and\nregulations or that we will comply with applicable environmental laws at all times. Such violations or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental laws also impose obligations and liability for the investigation and cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substance or fuel spills or releases.\nThese liabilities are often joint and several and may be imposed on the parties generating or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of affected property,\noften without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. We may also have liability for past\ncontaminated properties historically owned or operated by companies that we have acquired or merged with, even though we never owned or operated such properties.\nAccordingly, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for investigation, remediation, monitoring and other costs even if the contaminated property\nis not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. Contamination\nand exposure to hazardous substances can also result in claims for damages, including personal injury, property damage, and natural resources damage claims.\nMost of our properties currently have above or below ground storage tanks for fuel and other petroleum products and oil-water separators (or equivalent\nwastewater collection/treatment systems). Given the nature of our operations (which involve the use of diesel and other petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous\nsubstances) for fueling and maintaining our equipment and vehicles, and the historical operations at some of our properties, we may incur material costs associated with soil\nor groundwater contamination. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may\ngive rise to remediation liabilities or other claims or costs that may be material.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls could adversely affect our financial reporting, results of operations and share price and harm our\nbusiness.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in effective compliance and the prevention of fraud. Any inability to\nprovide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could adversely affect our results of operations and share price and harm our business.\nWe must annually evaluate our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of SOX, which requires management and auditors to assess\nthe effectiveness of our internal controls. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including\nthe possibility of human error, failure or interruption of technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can\nprovide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. The failure to maintain effective internal controls, as\nregulatory or financial reporting standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, could subject us to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or\nstockholder litigation.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could also result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition or results of operations.\nInadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our\nfinancial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a system of internal controls that\nfully complies with the requirements of SOX or that our management and independent registered public accounting firm will continue to conclude that our internal controls\nare effective.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks related to our internal controls and compliance systems, which may not be able to protect us from acts committed by employees,\nagents, or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to\ngovernment officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks, and false claims, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money\nlaundering, and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally\nprohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Any such improper\nactions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related\nshareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could have in the past and could in the\nfuture adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and U.K., and our domestic tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our\nfuture effective tax rates have in the past and could in the future be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n● expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n● tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n● costs related to intercompany restructurings;\n● changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and\n● lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in\njurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities or by U.K. authorities. Outcomes from\nthese audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the past, we have also been subject to adverse rulemaking positions and\nrulings regarding our tax positions, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, effective April 1, 2020,\nthe state of Washington Department of Revenue (“DOR”) published a rule which effectively deems the provision of standalone concrete pumping services as a retail sale\nsubject to sales tax. The Company does not charge sales tax to its customers that provide a reseller certificate, treating this as a wholesale transaction rather than as a retail\nsale. As such, for the period from April 1, 2020 through October 31, 2023, the Company has continued to not charge sales tax where its customers provide a reseller\ncertificate and has petitioned for declaratory relief from the rule. In February 2023, the Company received an adverse ruling from the Thurston County superior court\nregarding its position, which it has appealed and oral argument is scheduled for February 2024 in the Court of Appeals in Tacoma, Washington. If the Company is not\nsuccessful in its arguments against the DOR in its appeal, an estimated $3.5 million in sales tax, inclusive of interest and penalties, may be owed and would be accrued in\nthe quarter in which the court makes any unfavorable determination.\n13\nTable of Contents\nChanges in laws or, regulations or rules, or a failure to comply with any laws, regulations or rules, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of\noperations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and Nasdaq. In particular, we are required to comply with certain\nSEC, Nasdaq and other legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. and U.K. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult,\ntime consuming and costly.\nFor example, there is a growing concern from advocacy groups and the general public that the emissions of greenhouse gases and other human activities have\ncaused, or will cause, significant changes in weather patterns and temperatures and the frequency and severity of natural disasters. These concerns have resulted in\nincreasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting,\ndiligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change, waste production, water usage, human capital, labor, and risk oversight, and could expand the nature, scope, and\ncomplexity of matters on which we are required to control, assess, and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as\nwell as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, may create challenges for us, including for our compliance and ethics programs, the\nenvironment in which we do business and by increasing our ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nThese laws, regulations or rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect\non our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nEmployee Related Risks\nOur business depends on favorable relations with our employees. Any deterioration of these relations, including those with our union-represented employees, issues\nwith our collective bargaining agreements, labor shortages or increases in labor costs could disrupt our ability to serve our customers, lead to higher labor costs or the\npayment of withdrawal liability in connection with multiemployer plans, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of October 31, 2023, approximately 9% of our employees in the United States (but none of our employees in the United Kingdom) were represented by unions\nor covered by collective bargaining agreements. The states in which our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements are California,\nWashington and Oregon. There can be no assurance that our non-unionized employees will not become members of a union or become covered by a collective bargaining\nagreement, including through an acquisition of a business whose employees are subject to such an agreement. Any significant deterioration in employee relations, shortages\nof labor or increases in labor costs at any of our locations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A slowdown or\nwork stoppage that lasts for a significant period of time could cause lost revenues and increased costs and could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs.\nFurthermore, our labor costs have in the past and could in the future increase as a result of the settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes. In addition, our\ncollective bargaining agreement with our union in California was renewed as of July 1, 2022 and is effective through June 30, 2025. It will continue on a year-to-year basis\nafter unless parties provide advance written notice to change, amend, modify, or terminate the Agreement. No such notices have been given or received. Our collective\nbargaining agreement with our union in Oregon expires in 2024. Our collective bargaining agreement with our union in Washington expires in 2037. We cannot assure you\nthat renegotiation of these agreements will be successful or will not result in adverse economic terms or work stoppages or slowdowns.\nUnder our collective bargaining agreements, we are, and have previously been, obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of our\nunionized employees. A multiemployer pension plan is a defined benefit pension plan that provides pension benefits to the union-represented workers of various generally\nunrelated companies. Under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), an employer that has an obligation to contribute to an underfunded\nmultiemployer plan, as well as any other entities that are treated as a single employer with such employer under applicable tax and ERISA rules, may become jointly and\nseverally liable, generally upon complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer plan, for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded benefit obligations. These\nliabilities are known as “withdrawal liabilities.” Certain of the multiemployer plans to which we are obligated to contribute have been significantly underfunded in the past.\nIf any of the multiemployer plans were to become significantly underfunded again, and go into an “endangered status,” the trustees of the plan would be required to adopt\nand maintain a rehabilitation plan and we may be required to pay a surcharge on top of our regular contributions to the plan.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe currently have no intention of withdrawing, in either a complete or partial withdrawal, from any of the multiemployer plans to which we currently contribute,\nand we have not been assessed any withdrawal liability in the past when we have ceased participating in certain multiemployer plans to which we previously contributed. In\naddition, we believe that the “construction industry” multiemployer plan exception may apply if we did withdraw from any of our current multiemployer plans. The\n“construction industry” exception generally delays the imposition of withdrawal liability in connection with an employer’s withdrawal from a “construction industry”\nmultiemployer plan unless and until (among other things) that employer continues or resumes covered operations in the relevant geographic market without continuing or\nresuming (as applicable) contributions to the multiemployer plan. If this exception applies, withdrawal liability may be delayed or even inapplicable if we cease\nparticipation in any multiemployer plan(s). However, there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future, that the\n“construction industry exception” would apply if we did withdraw, or that we will not incur withdrawal liability if we do withdraw. Accordingly, we may be required to pay\nmaterial amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans is underfunded at the time of withdrawal and withdrawal liability applies in connection with our\nwithdrawal. In addition, we may incur material liabilities if any multiemployer plan(s) in which we participate requires us to increase our contribution levels to alleviate\nexisting underfunding and/or becomes insolvent, terminates or liquidates.\nLabor relations matters at construction sites where we provide services may result in increases in our operating costs, disruptions in our business and decreases in our\nearnings.\nLabor relations matters at construction sites where we provide services may result in work stoppages, which would in turn affect our ability to provide services at\nsuch locations. If any such work stoppages were to occur at work sites where we provide services, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Also, labor relations matters affecting our suppliers\ncould adversely impact our business from time to time.\nTurnover of members of our management, staff and pump operators and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may affect our ability to efficiently manage our\nbusiness and execute our strategy.\nOur business depends on the quality of, and our ability to attract and retain, our senior management and staff, and competition in our industry and the business\nworld for top management talent is generally significant. Although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages, we can provide no assurance that our efforts to\nattract and retain senior management staff will be successful. In addition, the loss of services of certain members of our senior management could adversely affect our\nbusiness until suitable replacements can be found.\nWe depend upon the quality of our staff personnel, including sales and customer service personnel (who routinely interact with and fulfill the needs of our\ncustomers), and on our ability to attract and retain and motivate skilled operators and fleet maintenance personnel and other associated personnel to operate our equipment\nin order to provide our concrete pumping services to our customers. There is significant competition for qualified personnel in a number of our markets where we face\ncompetition from the oil and gas industry for qualified drivers and operators. There is a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and\nsuch positions require a significant investment by us in initial and ongoing training of operators of our equipment. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to\nlocate, employ, or retain such qualified personnel on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our costs of operations and selling, general and administrative expenses have increased\nin certain markets and may increase in the future if we are required to increase wages and salaries to attract qualified personnel, and there is no assurance that we can\nincrease our prices to offset any such cost increases. There is also no assurance that we can effectively limit staff turnover as competitors or other employers seek to hire our\npersonnel. A significant increase in such turnover could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur financing agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nOur credit facilities impose, and any future financing agreements could impose, operating and financial restrictions on our activities, including restricting our\nability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other payments, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into transactions with\naffiliates and consolidate, merge or sell assets. These covenants could limit the ability of the respective restricted entities to fund future working capital and capital\nexpenditures, engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or otherwise realize the value of their assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a\nportion of cash flow from operations to payments on debt. In addition, such covenants limit the flexibility of the respective restricted entities in planning for, or reacting to,\nchanges in the industries in which they operate.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business and to fulfill our obligations under\nour indebtedness.\nAs of October 31, 2023, we had $394.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, consisting of (1) $375.0 million for our fixed 6.000% senior secured second lien notes\ndue 2026 (the \"Senior Notes\") and (2) $19.0 million outstanding under our ABL credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\"), in addition to $200.8 million of availability under\nour ABL Facility. Through June 29, 2022, borrowings in U.S. Dollars bore interest at either (1) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25% or (2) a base rate\nplus an applicable margin of 1.25%. After June 29, 2022 and through May 31, 2023, borrowings in U.S. Dollars bore interest at (1) the secured overnight financing rate\n(\"SOFR\") rate plus an applicable margin currently set at 2.00% or (2) a base rate plus an applicable margin currently set at 1.00%. After May 31, 2023, borrowings in U.S.\nDollars bear interest at (1) the SOFR rate plus an applicable margin currently set at 2.25% or (2) a base rate plus an applicable margin currently set at 1.25%. The applicable\nmargins for U.S. Dollar loans are subject to a step down of 0.25% based on excess availability levels. Through May 31, 2023, borrowings in GBP bore interest at the\nsterling overnight indexed average (\"SONIA\") rate plus an applicable margin currently set at 2.0326%. After May 31, 2023, borrowings in GBP bear interest at the SONIA\nrate plus an applicable margin equal to 2.2826%. The applicable margins for SONIA are subject to a step down of 0.25% based on excess availability levels. The ABL\nFacility matures the earlier of (a) June 1, 2028 or (b) the date that is 180 days prior to (i) the final stated maturity date of the Senior Notes or (ii) the date the Senior Notes\nbecome due and payable.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may not generate enough cash flow from operations to pay, when due, the principal of,\ninterest on or other amounts due in respect of, these obligations. Other risks relating to our long-term indebtedness include:\n● increased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n● we have recently experienced higher interest expense on our ABL Facility due to interest rate increases and we could experience higher interest expense on\nour ABL Facility if interest rates increase any further and our hedging strategies do not effectively mitigate the effects of these increases;\n● need to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund\nworking capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n● limited ability to obtain additional financing, on terms we find acceptable, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other\ninvestments, which may adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy;\n● limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate or to take advantage of market\nopportunities; and\n● a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of our Senior Notes and ABL\nFacility allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. In addition, our\ninability to maintain certain leverage ratios could result in acceleration of a portion of our debt obligations and could cause us to be in default if we are unable to repay the\naccelerated obligations.\nOur business could be hurt if we are unable to obtain capital as required, resulting in a decrease in our revenue and cash flows.\nWe require capital for, among other purposes, purchasing equipment to replace existing equipment that has reached the end of its useful life and for growth\nresulting from expansion into new markets, completing acquisitions and refinancing existing debt. If the cash that we generate from our business, together with cash that we\nmay borrow under our credit facilities, is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements, we will require additional debt or equity financing. If such additional financing is\nnot available to fund our capital requirements, we could suffer a decrease in our revenue and cash flows that would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, our ability to incur additional debt is and will be contingent upon, among other things, the covenants contained in our credit facilities. In addition, our credit\nfacilities place restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments (subject to certain exceptions). We cannot be\ncertain that any additional financing that we require will be available or, if available, will be available on terms that are satisfactory to us. If we are unable to obtain\nsufficient additional capital in the future, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under applicable debt\ninstruments, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations, including our credit facilities, depends on our financial condition and\noperating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may\nnot be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures,\nsell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital\nmarkets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous\ncovenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In\naddition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which\ncould harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards.\nWe are subject to the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq. If we became unable to meet such requirements, we and our shareholders could face significant\nmaterial adverse consequences including:\n● the delisting of our shares from Nasdaq and a limited availability of market quotations for our shares;\n● a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules,\npossibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; and\n● a decreased ability to issue additional shares or obtain additional financing in the future.\nShares of our common stock have been thinly traded in the past.\nAlthough a trading market for our common stock exists, the trading volume has not been significant and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for\nour common stock will be sustained in the future. As a result of the thin trading market or “float” for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate\nsignificantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and,\nas a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate his or her\ninvestment in our common stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the\ncase if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future.\nIn addition, the price of our securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial\nreports. Additionally, if our shares of common stock become delisted from Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Markets, the liquidity and price of our shares\nmay be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your shares unless a market can be\nestablished or sustained.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our industry, or if they change their recommendations\nregarding our common stock adversely, then the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our\nindustry, or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable\nrelative recommendations about our peers, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who covers the Company were to cease coverage of the\nCompany or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\n17\nTable of Contents\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing\nmarket price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the\nfuture at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of October 31, 2023, CFLL Holdings, LLC owns 15,477,138 shares, or 28% of outstanding shares of common stock and BBCP Investors, LLC owns\n11,005,275 shares, or 20% of our outstanding shares of our common stock. These shares are registered for resale and are not subject to any contractual restrictions on\ntransfer. The sale of some or all of these shares by these investors could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock, and the ownership of significant\nshareholders has in the past contributed to our low trading volumes, as further described under the risk factor above titled \"Shares of our common stock have been thinly\ntraded in the past.\".\nIn addition, shares of our common stock granted or reserved for future issuance under our Omnibus Incentive Plan become eligible for sale in the public market\nonce those shares are issued, subject to provisions in various vesting agreements and Rule 144, as applicable. Following amendments to our 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan\non October 29, 2020 and April 25, 2023, a total of 6.3 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under our 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which 1.4\nmillion shares of common stock remain available for future issuance as of October 31, 2023.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality, adverse weather\nand other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n● labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n● demand for our services;\n● profitability of our products, especially in new markets and due to seasonal fluctuations;\n● seasonal weather patterns in the construction industry on which we rely, with activity tending to be lowest in the winter and spring;\n● changes in interest rates;\n● impairment of long-lived assets;\n● macroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;\n● negative publicity relating to products we serve;\n● changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n● expansion to new markets; and\n● fluctuations in commodity prices.\n18\nTable of Contents\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own and we depend on cash flow from our wholly owned subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own or material assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. All of\nour operations are conducted by our subsidiaries and as a holding company, we require dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet cash requirements. The\nterms of any credit facility may restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring cash or other assets to us. If there is an insolvency, liquidation or\nother reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, our stockholders likely will have no right to proceed against their assets. Creditors of those subsidiaries will be entitled to\npayment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of those subsidiaries before we, as an equity holder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from that sale\nor disposal. If our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other payments to us when needed, we will be unable to satisfy our obligations.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in the Company's Charter and Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nThe Charter of the Company contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We\nare also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make more difficult the\nremoval of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These\nprovisions include:\n● a staggered board of directors providing for three classes of directors, which limits the ability of a stockholder or group to gain control of our Board;\n● no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n● the right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in\ncertain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n● a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n● a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of our\nBoard, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n● advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a\nmeeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of\ndirectors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe Charter of the Company designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings\nthat may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers\nor employees.\nThe Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and\nexclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or our stockholders, (iii) any action\nasserting a claim against the Company, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Charter or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action\nasserting a claim against the Company, our directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any\nclaim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable\nparty does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction\nof a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) arising under the Securities Act or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction\nincluding, without limitation, any claim arising under the Exchange Act, as to which the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive\nforum.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions\nof the Charter described in the preceding paragraph. However, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules\nand regulations thereunder. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or\nour directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, a court may determine that the choice of forum\nprovision is unenforceable. If a court were to find these provisions of the Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of\nactions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\n20\nTable of Contents\nItem 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as\nstatements regarding the Company’s expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause\nactual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-\nlooking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described in “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking\nStatements and Risk Factors Summary” and in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company assumes no obligation to update any of these\nforward-looking statements.\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Thornton, Colorado. The audited consolidated financial statements included herein include the accounts\nof Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries including Brundage-Bone Concrete Pumping, Inc. (“Brundage-Bone”), Capital Pumping, LP\n(“Capital”), and Camfaud Group Limited (“Camfaud”), and Eco-Pan, Inc. (“Eco-Pan”).\nAs part of the Company’s business growth strategy and capital allocation policy, strategic acquisitions are considered opportunities to enhance our value\nproposition through differentiation and competitiveness. Depending on the deal size and characteristics of the M&A opportunities available, we expect to allocate capital for\nopportunistic M&A utilizing cash on the balance sheet and the revolving line of credit. In recent years and as further described below, we have successfully executed on this\nstrategy, including (1) our November 2021 acquisition of Pioneer Concrete Pumping Service, Inc. (“Pioneer”) for the purchase consideration of $20.2 million, which\nprovided us with complementary assets and operations in both Georgia and Texas and (2) our acquisition of Coastal Carolina Concrete Pumping, Inc. (\"Coastal\") in August\n2022 for the purchase consideration of $30.8 million, which expanded our operations in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.\nU.S. Concrete Pumping\nAll branches operating within our U.S Concrete Pumping segment are concrete pumping service providers in the United States (\"U.S.\"). Their core business is the\nprovision of concrete pumping services to general contractors and concrete finishing companies in the commercial, infrastructure and residential sectors. Equipment\ngenerally returns to a “home base” nightly and these branches do not contract to purchase, mix, or deliver concrete. This segment collectively has approximately 100 branch\nlocations across 21 states with their corporate headquarters in Thornton, Colorado.\nIn recent years, U.S. Concrete Pumping has grown through the acquisitions of Coastal in August 2022 and Pioneer in November 2021, as described above, and the\ncompletion of the Company's greenfield expansion into the Washington DC metropolitan area in fiscal 2022.\nU.S. Concrete Waste Management Services\nOur U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment consists of our U.S. based Eco-Pan business. Eco-Pan provides industrial cleanup and containment\nservices, primarily to customers in the construction industry. Eco-Pan uses containment pans specifically designed to hold waste products from concrete and other industrial\ncleanup operations. Eco-Pan has 19 operating locations across the U.S. with its corporate headquarters in Thornton, Colorado.\n23\nTable of Contents\nU.K. Operations\nOur U.K. Operations segment consists of our Camfaud, Premier and U.K. based Eco-Pan businesses. Camfaud is a concrete pumping service provider in the U.K\nand its core business is primarily the provision of concrete pumping services to general contractors and concrete finishing companies in the commercial, infrastructure and\nresidential sectors. Equipment generally returns to a “home base” nightly and does not contract to purchase, mix, or deliver concrete. Camfaud has approximately 30 branch\nlocations throughout the U.K., with its corporate headquarters in Epping (near London), England. In addition, we have concrete waste management operations under our\nEco-Pan brand name in the U.K. and currently operate from a shared Camfaud location.\nCorporate (\"Other\")\nOur Corporate activities, referred to as \"Other\" in our financial statements, primarily relate to the intercompany leasing of real estate to certain of our U.S Concrete\nPumping branches.\nExpiration of Warrants\nAs of December 6, 2023, the Company’s 13,017,677 warrants to acquire shares of its common stock expired in accordance with their terms, and there are no other\nwarrants outstanding. As a result of the expiration, the warrants will no longer be recognized as a liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and there are no\nother warrants outstanding. As of October 31, 2023, the Company had a liability of $0.1 million related to the warrants that will be recognized in the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet and in the consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2024.\n2023 Upsize of Asset-Based Lending Credit Agreement\nAs of October 31, 2023, we had $200.8 million in availability under our ABL credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\") and $394.0 million of indebtedness\noutstanding, consisting of (1) $375.0 million for our fixed 6.000% senior secured second lien notes due 2026 (the \"Senior Notes\") and (2) $19.0 million outstanding under\nour ABL Facility. In June 2023, the Company amended and restated its existing ABL Facility to provide up to $225 million (previously $160 million) of commitments and\nextend the maturity of the ABL Facility to June 1, 2028. The June 1, 2023 amendments to the ABL Facility (1) increased the maximum revolver borrowings available to be\ndrawn thereunder from $160.0 million to $225.0 million, (2) increased the letter of credit sublimit from $10.5 million to $22.5 million and (3) extended the maturity of the\nABL Facility to the earlier of (a) June 1, 2028 or (b) the date that is 180 days prior to (i) the final stated maturity date of the Senior Notes or (ii) the date the Senior Notes\nbecome due and payable.\n24\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material\nimpact. Other factors that did not have a material impact, but that are significant to understand the results, are qualitatively described. The tables included in the period-to-\nperiod comparisons below provide summaries of our revenues, gross profits and net income for our business segments for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTwelve Months Ended October 31, 2023 and 2022\nRevenue\nYear Ended October 31, Change\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nRevenue\nU.S. Concrete Pumping $ 317,877 $ 296,506 $ 21,371 7.2%\nU.K. Operations 62,588 54,926 7,662 13.9%\nU.S. Concrete Waste Management Services (1) 62,405 50,191 12,214 24.3%\nReportable segment revenue 442,870 401,623 41,247 10.3%\nOther 2,500 2,500 - 0.0%\nIntersegment (1) (3,129) (2,831) (298) 10.5%\nTotal revenue $ 442,241 $ 401,292 $ 40,949 10.2%\n(1) For year ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, there were $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, included in revenue in the U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment and eliminated in the intersegment\neliminations. The remaining $2.5 million relates to the revenue as disclosed in Other.\nTotal revenue. Total revenues were $442.2 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2023, compared to $401.3 million for the twelve months ended\nOctober 31, 2022. Revenue by segment is further discussed below.\n25\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Concrete Pumping. Revenue for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment increased by 7.2%, or $21.4 million, from $296.5 million in the twelve months\nended October 31, 2022 to $317.9 million for fiscal 2023. The Company's acquisition of Coastal in fiscal 2022 drove an incremental year-over-year increase in revenue of\n$14.6 million. The remaining increase was driven by organic growth in certain markets.\nU.K. Operations. Revenue for our U.K. Operations segment increased by 13.9%, or $7.7 million, from $54.9 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2022\nto $62.6 million for fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact from foreign currency translation, revenue was up 10% year-over-year, due primarily to pricing improvements in\naddition to operating efficiencies.\nU.S. Concrete Waste Management Services. Revenue for the U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment improved by 24.3%, or $12.2 million, from $50.2\nmillion in the twelve months ended October 31, 2022 to $62.4 million for fiscal 2023. The increase was driven by strong organic growth, pricing improvements and\nthe expansion of concrete waste management service offerings.\nOther. There was no change in revenue for Other activities for the periods presented. These revenues are eliminated in consolidation through the Intersegment line\nitem.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nYear Ended October 31, Change\n(in thousands, unless otherwise stated) 2023 2022 $ %\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross Profit $ 178,304 $ 163,610 $ 14,694 9.0%\nGross Margin 40.3% 40.8%\nGross margin. Our gross margin for the year ended October 31, 2023 was 40.3% compared to 40.8% for the year ended October 31, 2022. The slight decrease in\nour gross margin was primarily related to inflationary pressures, mostly in labor inflation.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses (\"G&A\"). G&A expenses for the twelve months ended October 31, 2023 were $116.9 million, an increase of $3.4 million\nfrom $113.5 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to (1) higher labor costs of approximately $6.5 million\nprimarily due to additional personnel that joined the Company as a result of recent acquisitions, (2) higher rent, utilities and office expenses aggregating to $1.3 million\nprimarily from recent acquisitions and (3) higher legal and accounting expenses. These increases were offset by non-cash decreases in amortization expense of $3.6 million,\n$2.7 million related to fluctuations in the GBP and lower stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million. G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.4% for\nfiscal 2023 compared to 28.2% for the same period a year ago.\nExcluding amortization of intangible assets of $18.9 million, depreciation expense of $2.4 million and stock-based compensation expense of $3.8 million, G&A\nexpenses were $91.7 million for the fiscal year 2023 (20.7% of revenue), up $8.3 million from $83.4 million for fiscal 2022 (20.8% of revenue). The increase was primarily\ndue to the higher labor costs, legal and accounting costs, rent, utilities and office expenses, which was partially offset by fluctuations in the GBP as discussed above.\n26\nTable of Contents\nTotal other income (expense)\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the year ended October 31, 2023 was $28.1 million, up $2.2 million from the same period a year ago. The increase\nwas primarily attributable to a higher average ABL revolver draw during the year ended October 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended October 31, 2022.\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities. During the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 we recognized a $6.9 million gain and a $9.9 million gain,\nrespectively, on the fair value remeasurement of our liability-classified warrants. The continued decline in the fair value remeasurement of the public warrants for all periods\npresented was due to the Company's share price trading below the exercise price as the warrants approached their expiration in December 2023. On December 6, 2023, we\nannounced the expiration of the Company’s 13,017,677 warrants to acquire shares of its common stock, after which they will no longer be recognized as a liability on the\nbalance sheet.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense. For the year ended October 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $8.8 million on a pretax income of $40.6\nmillion. During the year ended October 31, 2023, the effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the respective change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $6.9 million.\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2022, the effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the respective change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $9.9 million and a\ndeferred tax benefit from undistributed foreign earnings of $0.8 million.\n27\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA1 and Net Income\nNet Income Adjusted EBITDA\nYear Ended October 31, Year Ended October 31, Change\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 $ %\nU.S. Concrete Pumping $ 5,106 $ 6,541 $ 73,583 $ 75,002 $ (1,419) -1.9%\nU.K. Operations 4,160 2,080 18,486 15,717 2,769 17.6%\nU.S. Concrete Waste Management Services 14,348 8,898 30,030 22,838 7,192 31.5%\nOther 8,176 11,157 2,501 2,499 2 0.1%\nTotal $ 31,790 $ 28,676 $ 124,600 $ 116,056 $ 8,544 7.4%\n1 See “Non-GAAP Measures (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA)” below. As of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we have modified the method in which adjusted EBITDA is calculated by no longer including an add-back\nfor director costs and public company expenses. The Company recast adjusted EBITDA for U.S. Concrete Pumping for the year ended 2022 by $2.5 million to reflect this change. See “Non-GAAP Measures (EBITDA\nand Adjusted EBITDA)” below for more information.\nU.S. Concrete Pumping. Net income for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment was $5.1 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2023, down from net\nincome of $6.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.S. Concrete Pumping segment was $73.6 million for the twelve months\nended October 31, 2023, down 1.9% from $75.0 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. The decrease in net income and Adjusted EBITDA were primarily\nattributable to inflationary pressures impacting gross margins in excess of the improvements to revenue.\nU.K. Operations. Net income for our U.K. Operations segment was $4.2 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2023, up from net income of $2.1\nmillion for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.K. Operations segment was $18.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31,\n2023, up 17.6% from $15.7 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. The increase in net income and Adjusted EBITDA were primarily attributable to the\nyear-over-year improvement in revenue.\nU.S. Concrete Waste Management Services. Net income for our U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment was $14.3 million for the twelve months\nended October 31, 2023, up from net income of $8.9 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.S. Concrete Waste Management\nServices segment was $30.0 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2023, up 31.5% from $22.8 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. The\nincrease in net income and Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the year-over-year robust organic growth in revenue as discussed above.\nOther. Net income for both periods presented for Other activities were mostly driven by the gains from the revaluation of warrant liabilities. There was no change\nin Adjusted EBITDA for our Other activities for the periods presented.\n28\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur capital structure is primarily a combination of (1) permanent financing, represented by stockholders’ equity; (2) zero-dividend convertible perpetual preferred\nstock; (3) long-term financing represented by our Senior Notes and (4) short-term financing under our ABL Facility. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated\nfrom operations, available cash and cash equivalents and access to our revolving credit facility under our ABL Facility, which provides for aggregate borrowings of up to\n$225.0 million, subject to a borrowing base limitation. We use our liquidity and capital resources to: (1) finance working capital requirements; (2) service our indebtedness;\n(3) purchase property, plant and equipment; and (4) finance strategic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Pioneer, Coastal and others. As of October 31, 2023, we had\n$15.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $200.8 million of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility, providing total available liquidity of $216.7 million.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or pay down borrowings on the outstanding balance of our ABL Facility or Senior Notes using cash on hand. Such\nrepayments, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our\nworking capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will\ndepend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, potential acquisitions and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future\nsources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of\nadditional equity could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such\ndebt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur principal uses of cash historically have been to fund operating activities and working capital, purchases of property and equipment, strategic acquisitions, fund\npayments due under facility operating and finance leases, share repurchases and to meet debt service requirements.\nOur working capital surplus as of October 31, 2023 was $10.3 million. We generally have consistent access to capital markets and we are in compliance with our\ndebt covenants.\nThe amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects. In response to\nchanging economic conditions, we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them (either up or down) to match our actual\nperformance. Our capital expenditures for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $54.5 million and $101.9 million, respectively.\nTo service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating\nperformance and the availability of borrowings under the ABL Facility and/or other debt and equity financing alternatives available to us, which will be affected by\nprevailing economic conditions and conditions in the global credit and capital markets, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our\ncontrol. Based on our current level of operations and given the current state of the capital markets, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available\nborrowings under the ABL Facility will be adequate to service our debt and meet our future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. See “Senior Notes and ABL Facility”\ndiscussion below for more information.\n29\nTable of Contents\nFuture Contractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness, interest payments, lease\nagreements and capital expenditures. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements except for our committed capital as discussed below. Our estimated future obligations as of\nOctober 31, 2023 include both current and long term obligations. We have a long-term obligation of $375.0 million related to our Senior Notes due February 2026\n(excluding discount for deferred financing costs). Under our operating leases, we have short-term obligations for payments of $6.3 million and long-term obligations for\npayments of $25.3 million. We have current obligations related to finance leases of $0.1 million and a long-term obligation of $0.1 million. We have a current obligation for\nour ABL Facility of $19.0 million. Additionally, the Company was contractually committed for $30.2 million of capital expenditures for purchases of property and\nequipment and these are expected to be paid in the next twelve months.\nSenior Notes and ABL Facility\nThe table below is a summary of the composition of the Company's debt balances as of October 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAs of October 31, As of October 31,\n(in thousands) Interest Rates Maturities 2023 2022\nRevolving loan - short term Varies June 2028 $ 18,954 $ 52,133\nSenior notes - long term 6.0000% February 2026 375,000 375,000\nTotal debt, gross 393,954 427,133\nLess: Unamortized deferred financing costs offsetting long term debt (3,132) (4,524)\nLess: Revolving Loan - short term (18,954) (52,133)\nLong term debt, net of unamortized deferred financing costs $ 371,868 $ 370,476\nAmendment to ABL Facility\nOn June 1, 2023, the ABL Facility was amended to, among other changes, (1) increase the maximum revolver borrowings available to be drawn thereunder from\n$160.0 million to $225.0 million, (2) increase the letter of credit sublimit from $10.5 million to $22.5 million and (3) extend the maturity of the ABL Facility to the earlier\nof (a) June 1, 2028 or (b) the date that is 180 days prior to (i) the final stated maturity date of the Senior Notes or (ii) the date the Senior Notes become due and payable. The\nABL Facility also provides for an uncommitted accordion feature under which the borrowers under the ABL Facility can, subject to specified conditions, increase the ABL\nFacility by up to an additional $75.0 million. The $65.0 million in incremental commitments were provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank, N.A. The\namended ABL Facility was treated as a debt modification. The Company capitalized an additional $0.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the June 1, 2023, ABL\nFacility amendment. The preexisting unamortized deferred costs of $1.4 million and the additional costs of $0.5 million will be amortized from June 1, 2023 through June 1,\n2028.\nThe outstanding balance under the ABL Facility as of October 31, 2023 was $19.0 million and as of that date, the Company was in compliance with all debt\ncovenants. In addition, as of October 31, 2023, the Company had $1.1 million in credit line reserves and a letter of credit balance of $4.1 million. As of October 31, 2023,\nwe had $200.8 million of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility. Debt issuance costs related to revolving credit facilities are capitalized and reflected as an\nasset in deferred financing costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company had debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facilities of $1.8\nmillion as of October 31, 2023. See Note 10 in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the Senior Notes and ABL Facility.\n30\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nCash generated from operating activities typically reflects net income, as adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based\ncompensation, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Generally, we believe our business requires a relatively low level of working capital investment due to low\ninventory requirements and timely customer payments due to daily billings for most of our services.\nCash flow provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities generally reflects the cash effects of transactions and other events used in the\ndetermination of net income or loss.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the twelve months ended October 31, 2023 was $96.9 million. The Company had net income of $31.8 million,\nwhich included non-cash expense items of $66.3 million. In addition, we had cash net outflows related to an increase in our working capital of $1.2 million. Working capital\nchanges primarily include a decrease in accrued payroll, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.5 million, an increase in inventory of $1.1 million and a\ndecrease in accounts payable of $0.5 million, mostly offset by an increase in net income taxes payable of $2.2 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of\n$1.3 million. The decrease in accrued payroll, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily related to payments for operating lease liabilities of $5.3 million, mostly\noffset by an increase to accrued payroll related to the timing of payroll payments. The increase in net income taxes payable is primarily related to the timing of payments\nremitted.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the twelve months ended October 31, 2022 was $76.7 million. The Company had net income of $28.7 million that\nincluded non-cash expense items of $60.4 million. In addition, we had net cash inflows related to a decrease to our working capital of $14.9 million. Working capital\nchanges primarily include cash inflows from a decrease of $15.3 million in trade receivables, a decrease of $3.0 million in accounts payable, an increase of $0.9 million in\ninventory, partially offset by an increase of $5.2 million in accrued payroll, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and an increase of prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets of $0.6 million. The decrease to trade receivables is primarily due to timing of customer receipts. The increase in accrued payroll, accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities is primarily related to an aggregate increase of $8.9 million in (1) increase in accrued insurance, (2) accrued capital expenditures and (3) other smaller\nitems, partially offset by a decrease in the operating lease liability of $3.7 million related to the change in operating lease liability due to the implementation of ASC 842 and\nbifurcating out the operating lease payments.\nCash flow provided by (used in) investing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities generally reflects the cash outflows for property, plant and\nequipment.\nWe used $44.2 million to fund investing activities during the twelve months ended October 31, 2023. The Company used $54.5 million for the purchase of\nproperty, plant and equipment and $0.8 million for the purchase of intangible assets. These amounts were partially offset by $11.1 million in proceeds from the sale of\nproperty, plant and equipment.\nWe used $124.1 million to fund investing activities during the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. The Company used $101.9 million for the purchase of\nproperty, plant and equipment, $30.8 million to fund the acquisition of Coastal and $1.5 million for the purchase of intangible assets. These amounts were partially offset by\n$10.0 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.\nCash flow provided by (used in) financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities generally reflects the cash changes related to our Senior\nNotes and ABL Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $44.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2023. Cash used in financing activities included (1) $33.2 million\nin net payments under the Company's ABL Facility and (2) $10.5 million in purchase of treasury stock, which included $8.9 million purchased under the share repurchase\nprogram and $1.6 million in outflows from the purchase of shares into treasury stock in order to fund the employee tax obligations for certain vested stock awards.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $46.0 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. Financing activities during this period primarily\nincluded $50.4 million in net borrowings under the Company’s ABL Facility that were partially offset by $4.1 million in outflows from the purchase of shares into treasury\nstock, which included $2.7 million purchased under the share repurchase program and $1.4 million in outflows from the purchase of shares into treasury stock in order to\nfund the employee tax obligations for certain vested stock awards.\n31\nTable of Contents\nAccounting and Other Reporting Matters\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA)\nWe calculate EBITDA by taking GAAP net income and adding back interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated\nby taking EBITDA and adding back transaction expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation, other income, net, goodwill and intangibles impairment\nand other adjustments. Transaction expenses represent expenses for legal, accounting, and other professionals that were engaged in the completion of various acquisitions.\nTransaction expenses can be volatile as they are primarily driven by the size of a specific acquisition. As such, we exclude these amounts from Adjusted EBITDA for\ncomparability across periods. Other adjustments include the adjustments for warrant liabilities revaluation, non-recurring expenses and non-cash currency gains/losses. As\nof the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we modified the method in which adjusted EBITDA is calculated by no longer including an add-back for director costs and public\ncompany expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 is recast by $2.5 million for these expenses to reflect this change.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding certain financial and\nbusiness trends related to our financial condition and results of operations, and as a supplemental tool for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and\ntrends and in comparing our financial measures with competitors who also present similar non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, these measures (1) are used in\nquarterly and annual financial reports and presentations prepared for management, our board of directors and investors, and (2) help management to determine incentive\ncompensation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated under\nGAAP. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA differently or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as comparative measures.\nYear Ended October 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nConsolidated\nNet income $ 31,790 $ 28,676\nInterest expense, net 28,119 25,891\nIncome tax expense 8,772 5,526\nDepreciation and amortization 58,666 57,462\nEBITDA 127,347 117,555\nTransaction expenses 61 318\nStock-based compensation 3,847 5,034\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (6,899) (9,894)\nOther income, net (330) (88)\nOther adjustments(1) 574 3,131\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 124,600 $ 116,056\nYear Ended October 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nU.S. Concrete Pumping\nNet income $ 5,106 $ 6,541\nInterest expense, net 25,294 22,968\nIncome tax expense 3,317 2,465\nDepreciation and amortization 41,870 40,304\nEBITDA 75,587 72,278\nTransaction expenses 61 318\nLoss on debt extinguishment - -\nStock-based compensation 3,847 5,034\nOther income, net (284) (49)\nOther adjustments(1) (5,628) (2,579)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 73,583 $ 75,002\n1 Other adjustments include the adjustment for non-recurring expenses and non-cash currency gains/losses.

However, events that are\noutside of our control cannot be predicted and, as such, they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions. If there is a significant unfavorable\nchange to current conditions, it could result in a material impact to our consolidated and combined results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We believe that the\nestimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time. Presented below are those accounting policies that we\nbelieve require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results. However, the majority of our business activities are in environments where\nwe are paid a fee for a service performed, and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting\npolicies that are not particularly subjective, nor complex.\nListed below are those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 350, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), the Company evaluates goodwill for\npossible impairment annually, generally as of August 31st, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not\nbe recoverable. The Company uses a two-step process to assess the realizability of goodwill. The first step (generally referred to as a \"step 0\" analysis) is a qualitative\nassessment that analyzes current economic indicators associated with a particular reporting unit. For example, the Company analyzes changes in economic, market and\nindustry conditions, business strategy, cost factors, and financial performance, among others, to determine if there are indicators of a significant decline in the fair value of a\nparticular reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates a stable or improved fair value, no further testing is required. If a qualitative assessment indicates it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company will proceed to the quantitative second step (generally referred to as a\n\"step 1\" analysis) where the fair value of a reporting unit is calculated based on weighted income and market-based approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit is lower\nthan its carrying value, an impairment to goodwill is recorded, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in the reporting unit.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating fair\nvalue of individual reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and\neconomic conditions including those relating to the duration and severity of COVID-19. These assumptions and estimates include projected revenue, cash flow margins,\ncapital expenditures, trade name royalty rates, discount rate, tax amortization benefit and other market factors outside of our control. The Company evaluates for triggering\nevents quarterly throughout the fiscal year.\nWhen we perform any goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of our reporting units are determined using an income approach that utilizes a discounted\ncash flow (“DCF”) model and a market approach that utilizes the guideline public company method (“GPC”), both of which are weighted for each reporting unit and are\ndiscussed below in further detail. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (\"ASC 820\"), we evaluated the methods for reasonableness and reliability\nand assigned weightings accordingly. A mathematical weighting is not prescribed by ASC 820, rather it requires judgement. As such, each of the valuation methods were\nweighted by accounting for the relative merits of each method and considered, among other things, the reliability of the valuation methods and the inputs used in the\nmethods. In addition, in order to assess the reasonableness of the fair value of our reporting units as calculated under both approaches, we also compare the Company’s total\nfair value to its market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess sum of the reporting unit’s fair value over its market capitalization). We evaluate\nthe implied control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions, as applicable.\n34\nTable of Contents\nUnder the income approach, the DCF model is based on expected future after-tax operating cash flows of the reporting unit, discounted to a present value using a\nrisk-adjusted discount rate. Estimates of future cash flows require management to make significant assumptions concerning (i) future operating performance, including\nfuture sales, long-term growth rates, operating margins, variations in the amount and timing of cash flows and the probability of achieving the estimated cash flows, (ii) the\nprobability of regulatory approvals, and (iii) future economic conditions, including the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which may differ from actual\nfuture cash flows. These assumptions are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe discount rate, which is intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in the DCF model, is based on estimates of the weighted average cost\nof capital (“WACC”) of market participants relative to our reporting unit. Financial and credit market volatility can directly impact certain inputs and assumptions used to\ndevelop the WACC. Any changes in these assumptions may affect our fair value estimate and the result of an impairment test. The discount rates and other inputs and\nassumptions are consistent with those that a market participant would use.\nThe GPC method provides an estimate of value using multiples derived from the stock prices of publicly traded companies. This method requires a selection of\ncomparable publicly-traded companies on major exchanges and involves a certain degree of judgment, as no two companies are entirely alike. These companies should be\nengaged in the same or a similar line of business as the reporting units being evaluated. Once comparable companies are selected, the application of the GPC method\nincludes (i) analysis of the guideline public companies' financial and operating performance, growth, intangible asset's value, size, leverage, and risk relative to the\nrespective reporting unit, (ii) calculation of valuation multiples for the selected guideline companies, and (iii) application of the valuation multiples to each reporting unit's\nselected operating metrics to arrive at an indication of value. Market multiples for the selected guideline public companies are developed by dividing the business enterprise\nvalue of each guideline public company by a measure of its financial performance (e.g., earnings). The business enterprise value is calculated taking the market value of\nequity (share price times fully-diluted shares outstanding) plus total interest bearing debt net of cash, preferred stock and minority interest. The market value of equity is\nbased upon the stock price of equity as of the valuation date, and the debt figures are taken from the most recently available financial statements as of the valuation date. In\nselecting appropriate multiples to apply to each reporting unit, we perform a comparative analysis between the reporting units and the guideline public companies. In\nmaking a selection, we consider the revenue growth, profitability and the size of the reporting unit compared to the guideline public companies, and the overall EBITDA\nmultiples implied from the transaction price. In addition, we consider a control premium for purposes of estimating the fair value of our reporting units as we believe that a\nmarket participant buyer would be required to pay a premium for control of our business. The control premium utilized is based on control premiums observed in recent\ncomparable market transactions.\nFor long lived intangible assets not subject to amortization, we test for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their\ncarrying value may not be recoverable. In testing long-lived intangible assets for impairment, we compare the fair value with the carrying value. The determination of fair\nvalue is based on the relief from royalty method, which models the cash flows from the intangibles assuming royalties were received under a licensing agreement. This\ndiscounted cash flow analysis uses inputs such as forecasted future revenues attributable to the reporting unit, assumed royalty rates and a discount rate. If we were to\nexperience a decrease in forecasted future revenues attributable to the brands, this could indicate a potential impairment. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair\nvalue, the long-lived intangible asset is considered impaired, and an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair\nvalue of the intangible asset.\nThe Company's annual impairment analysis is performed each year on August 31. The Company determined that it is more likely than not that the goodwill and\nlong-lived intangible assets were not impaired during fiscal 2023. If the planned business performance expectations are not met or if specific valuation factors out of our\ncontrol, such as the discount rate, change significantly, then the estimated FVs of the reporting unit might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.\nThe Company elected to have a step one impairment analysis performed as of August 31, 2022 on the Company’s U.S. Concrete Pumping, U.S. Concrete Waste\nManagement Services, and U.K. Operations reporting units. Management’s projections used to estimate the discounted cash flows included modest annual increases to\nrevenue volumes and rates, cash flow margins that are consistent with recently achieved actual amounts, terminal growth rates of 3.0% and discount rates ranging from\n10.0% to 11.3%.\nAs a result of the goodwill impairment analysis, the fair values of its U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services and U.K. Operations reporting units substantially\nexceeded their carrying values by 82% and 32%, respectively.\nFor the U.S. Concrete Pumping reporting unit, which had goodwill of $147.5 million, the fair value was approximately 7% greater than its carrying value. Changes\nin any of the significant assumptions used could materially affect the expected cash flows and such impacts could result in a potentially material non-cash impairment\ncharge. The most sensitive assumption is the discount rate and a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have resulted in any of the reporting units’ carrying\nvalues exceeding their fair values.\n35\nTable of Contents\nBusiness combinations and asset acquisitions\nThe Company applies the principles provided in ASC 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC 805\"), to determine whether a transaction involves an asset or a\nbusiness.\nIf it is determined an acquisition is a business combination, tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and\ngoodwill is recognized to the extent the fair value of the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Transaction costs for business\ncombinations are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 805.\nIf it is determined an acquisition is an asset acquisition, the purchase consideration (which will include certain transaction costs) is allocated first to indefinite\nlived intangible assets (if applicable) based on their fair values with the remaining balance of purchase consideration being allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities\nbased on their relative fair values.\nThe application of acquisition accounting requires the Company to make fair value determinations as of the valuation date. In making these determinations, the\nCompany is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts, including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparable and\ndiscount rates, replacement costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from acquired deferred tax assets. To assist the Company in\nmaking these fair value determinations, the Company may engage third-party valuation specialists or internal specialists who generally assist the Company in the fair value\ndetermination of identifiable assets such as customer relationships, property and equipment and any other significant asset or liabilities. The Company’s estimates in this\narea impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization and income tax expense or benefit that we report. The Company’s estimates of fair value are\nbased upon assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor a detailed description of recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements refer to Note 3 to the Company’s audited financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act; therefore, pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to\nprovide the information required by this Item.\n36\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of\nOctober 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2023,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAlso in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing\nunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,\nas well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n38\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition\nof the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required\nto be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts\nor disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition for United States (U.S.) Concrete Pumping Services\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives the vast majority of its revenue from concrete pumping services, of which a\nsignificant portion is related to U.S. concrete pumping services, comes from daily service, where the Company sends a single operator with a conventional concrete pump\ntruck to deliver concrete from one point to another as directed by the customer. Customers are billed on either (1) a solely time basis or (2) a time and volume pumped\nbasis. The Company's performance obligations related to these jobs are satisfied daily and invoiced accordingly. For the year ended October 31, 2023, net sales for U.S.\nconcrete pumping services was $317.9 million.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for U.S. concrete pumping services is a critical audit matter\nis a high degree of audit effort in performing audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for U.S. concrete pumping services.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the U.S. concrete pumping services revenue recognition process, including controls\nover the initiation, billing and recording of revenue and the authorization of credit memos. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing revenue transactions,\non a sample basis, by tracing revenue transactions to source documents, such as customer acceptance, invoices, and subsequent cash receipts; (ii) testing credit memo\ntransactions, on a sample basis, by tracing to source documents, such as the related invoice and support related to the business reason for the credit; and (iii) confirming,\non a sample basis, outstanding customer invoice balances as of year-end and, and for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as\ninvoices, customer acceptance, or subsequent cash receipts.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nDenver, Colorado\nJanuary 16, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\n39\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nConcrete Pumping Holdings, Inc.\nThornton, Colorado\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as of October 31, 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as\nthe “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company\nat October 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe served as the Company's auditor from 2018 to 2023.\nDallas, Texas\nJanuary 31, 2023\n40\nTable of Contents\nConcrete Pumping Holdings, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of October 31, As of October 31,\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) 2023 2022\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 15,861 $ 7,482\nTrade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $978 and $941, respectively 62,976 62,882\nInventory 6,732 5,532\nIncome taxes receivable -

Organization and Description of Business\nOrganization\nConcrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Thornton, Colorado. The Consolidated Financial Statements\ninclude the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries including Brundage-Bone Concrete Pumping, Inc. (“Brundage-Bone”), Capital Pumping\n(“Capital”), Camfaud Group Limited (“Camfaud”), and Eco-Pan, Inc. (“Eco-Pan”).\nNature of business\nBrundage-Bone and Capital are concrete pumping service providers in the United States (\"U.S.\") and Camfaud is a concrete pumping service provider in the\nUnited Kingdom (“U.K.”). Their core business is the provision of concrete pumping services to general contractors and concrete finishing companies in the commercial,\ninfrastructure and residential sectors. Most often equipment returns to a “home base” nightly and these service providers do not contract to purchase, mix, or deliver\nconcrete. Brundage-Bone and Capital collectively have approximately 100 branch locations across approximately 21 states, with its corporate headquarters in Thornton,\nColorado. Camfaud has approximately 30 branch locations throughout the U.K., with its corporate headquarters in Epping (near London), England.\nEco-Pan provides industrial cleanup and containment services, primarily to customers in the construction industry. Eco-Pan uses containment pans specifically\ndesigned to hold waste products from concrete and other industrial cleanup operations. Eco-Pan has 19 operating locations across the U.S. with its corporate headquarters in\nThornton, Colorado. In addition, we have concrete waste management operations under our Eco-Pan brand name in the U.K. and currently operate from a shared Camfaud\nlocation.\nSeasonality\nThe Company’s sales are historically seasonal, with lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year. Such seasonality also\ncauses the Company’s working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter and primarily depends on the variability of weather patterns with the\nCompany generally having lower sales volume during the winter and spring months.\n47\nTable of Contents\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of consolidation and Basis of presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of\nAmerica (“GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include all accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant estimates include the liability for incurred but unreported claims under various partially self-insured polices, goodwill and intangible\nimpairment analysis, valuation of share-based compensation, accounting for business combinations and estimates used in calculating the right-of-use asset and lease\nliability. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of replacement parts for concrete pumping equipment. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net\nrealizable value. The Company evaluates inventory and records an allowance for obsolete and slow- moving inventory to account for cost adjustments.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Financial Accounting Standard Board's (the \"FASB\") standard on fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize\nthe use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy\nis based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. This standard establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair\nvalue:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.\n48\nTable of Contents\nDeferred financing costs\nDeferred financing costs representing third-party, non-lender debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term\nof the related long-term-debt agreement, and the straight-line method for the revolving credit agreement.\nDebt issuance costs, including any original issue discounts, related to term loans or senior notes are reflected as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the\nlong-term debt liability that is included in long term debt, net of discount for deferred financing costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Debt issuance costs\nrelated to revolving credit facilities are capitalized and reflected as an asset in deferred financing costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of\ndebt issuance costs are recorded in interest expense.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 350, Intangibles–Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), the Company evaluates goodwill for\npossible impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The\nCompany uses a two-step process to assess the realizability of goodwill. The first step (generally referred to as a \"step 0\" analysis) is a qualitative assessment that analyzes\ncurrent economic indicators associated with a particular reporting unit. For example, the Company analyzes changes in economic, market and industry conditions, business\nstrategy, cost factors, and financial performance, among others, to determine if there are indicators of a significant decline in the fair value of a particular reporting unit. If\nthe qualitative assessment indicates a stable or improved fair value, no further testing is required. If a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company will proceed to the quantitative second step (generally referred to as a \"step 1\" analysis) where the\nfair value of a reporting unit is calculated based on weighted income and market-based approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, an\nimpairment to goodwill is recorded, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in the reporting unit.\nThe Company performed a qualitative test as of the annual impairment testing date of August 31, 2023 and there were no impairment indicators present. As of\nOctober 31, 2023, no triggering events were identified. The Company performed a quantitative impairment analysis as of August 31, 2022. Based on the results of this\nanalysis the fair values of the Company's reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and as such, no impairments were identified. Refer to Note 8 for further\ndiscussion.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for additions and betterments are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are\ncharged to expense as incurred; however, maintenance and repairs that improve or extend the life of existing assets are capitalized. The carrying amount of assets disposed\nof and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or losses from property and equipment disposals are recognized\nin the year of disposal. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the lease, whichever\nis shorter. All other property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nIn Years\nBuildings and improvements 15 to 40\nFinance lease assets—buildings 40\nFurniture and office equipment 2 to 7\nMachinery and equipment 3 to 25\nTransportation equipment 3 to 7\nFinance lease assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset (see Note 9).\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at cost or their estimated fair value (when acquired through a business combination or asset acquisition) less accumulated\namortization (if finite-lived).\nIntangible assets with finite lives, except for customer relationships, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Customer relationships\nare amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual reviews for\nimpairment. The Company performed a qualitative test as of the annual impairment testing date of August 31, 2023 and there were no impairment indicators present. As of\nOctober 31, 2023, no triggering events were identified. The Company elected to perform a step 1 impairment test on its indefinite-lived trade names as of August 31, 2022\nand no impairments were identified. Refer to Note 8 for further discussion.\n49\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360) requires other long-lived assets to be evaluated for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. If\nindicators are present, assets are grouped to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groups and cash flows are estimated for\neach asset group over the remaining estimated life of each asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the asset’s\ncarrying amount, impairment is recognized in the amount of the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. No indicators of impairment were identified as of October\n31, 2023.\nDerivatives\nThe Company has public warrants outstanding and due to certain provisions in the warrant agreement, coupled with the Company's capital structure, which\nincludes preferred stock with voting rights, the public warrants do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity and instead meet the definition of a liability-\nclassified derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\"). As such, the Company recognizes these warrants within long-term liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheet at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at each reporting date. See further\ndiscussion of the warrants fair value in Note 5.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company generates revenues primarily from (1) concrete pumping services in both the U.S. and U.K and (2) the Company’s concrete waste services business,\nboth of which are discussed below. In addition, the Company generates an immaterial amount of revenue from the sales of replacement parts to customers. The Company’s\ndelivery terms for replacement part sales are FOB shipping point.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (“ASC 842”) on October 31, 2022, effective as of November 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective method.\nRevenue for the reporting periods ending after October 31, 2021 is presented under ASC 606 or ASC 842. With the exception of the daily pan rental fee for the Company's\nconcrete waste services business, which is accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, all other revenue for the Company is recorded in accordance with ASC 606 (see\ndiscussion below for each revenue stream).\nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606)\nConcrete Pumping Services\nThe vast majority of the Company's revenue from concrete pumping services comes from the Company's daily service, where the Company sends a single operator\nwith a conventional concrete pump truck (an articulating boom attached to a large truck) to deliver concrete (or other construction material such as aggregate) from one\npoint to another as directed by the customer. Customers are billed on either (1) a solely time basis or (2) a time and volume pumped basis. Additional charges (such as a fuel\nsurcharge and travel costs) are frequently added based on specific project requirements. The Company's performance obligations related to these jobs are satisfied daily and\ninvoiced accordingly and as such, there are no unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of any day.\nA much smaller component of the total concrete pumping services revenue comes from placing boom services. Placing booms have become an essential tool in the\nefficient construction of high-rise buildings. A placing boom is the articulating boom component of a conventional concrete pump truck, positioned on the uppermost floor\nof a building construction project. Concrete is then supplied through a pipeline from the pump that remains at ground level. Due to the long term nature of high-rise jobs,\nthese contracts are generally longer term but typically not in excess of one year. Customers are generally invoiced (1) at month end for a fixed monthly placing boom usage\nfee, (2) daily for time worked and volume of concrete pumped and (3) at the beginning of the job for certain set-up costs and at the end of the job for tear-down costs. As it\npertains to the fixed monthly usage fee and daily fees related to time worked and volume of concrete pumped, which collectively make up a significant portion of the total\nconsideration in the contract, the Company recognizes revenue as invoiced in accordance with ASC 606. For the consideration allocated to set-up and tear-down fees, the\nCompany recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated term of the contract. The aggregate asset or liability from these services is not significant. As\ninvoices are issued with terms of net 30 and substantially all of the contracts are completed within a year, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance\nobligations, which would include the value of future usage of the Company’s placing boom assets, hours to be worked or cubic yards to be pumped.\n50\nTable of Contents\nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606) & Lease revenue (ASC 842)\nConcrete Waste Services\nThe Company’s concrete waste services business consists of service fees charged to customers for the delivery and usage over time of its pans or containers and the\ndisposal of the concrete waste material. Almost all contracts include two prices: (1) A fixed price that includes (a) the pickup and disposal of the waste material and (b) a\nspecified number of days the customer can use the pan and (2) a daily rental price if the customer keeps the pan for a time period in excess of days permitted in the fixed\nprice. For these services, the Company has identified two performance obligations: (1) the daily usage of the pans or containers and (2) the pickup and disposal of the waste\nmaterial. The fees allocable to these obligations are based on their standalone selling prices based on observable prices or an expected cost plus margin approach. The\nCompany recognizes lease revenue monthly for the daily usage fees pursuant to ASC 842 and recognizes the revenue attributable to the disposal services when the disposal\nis completed pursuant to ASC 606. The aggregate asset or liability from these services is not significant. As invoices are issued with terms of net 30 and substantially all of\nthe contracts are completed within a year, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations, which would include the remaining days the pans will be\nutilized or the future pickup and disposal of the waste material.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from pan rentals in the period earned, regardless of the timing of billing to customers. A pan rental contract is fixed in nature, but\nthe total includes a fixed amount for the pan rental and a services component. The performance obligation for the service component of the pan rental is satisfied at the time\nof the pan rental pickup, which is when the Company will recognize the services component revenue under ASC 606. The pan rental contract is generally rented for short\nperiods of time (less than a year). The pan rental is disclosed under ASC 842 revenue and the services component is disclosed under ASC 606 revenue.\nLeases as Lessor\nOur Eco-Pan business involves contracts with customers whereby we are a lessor for the rental component of the contract and therefore, such rental components of\nthe contract are recorded as lease revenue. We account for such rental contracts as operating leases. We recognize revenue from pan rentals in the period earned, regardless\nof the timing of billing to customers. The lease component of the revenue is disaggregated by a base price that is based on the number of contractual days and a variable\ncomponent that is based on days in excess of the number of contractual days. See further discussion above under \"Revenue recognition\".\nThe table below summarizes our revenues as presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 by revenue\ntype and by applicable accounting standard:\nYear Ended October 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nService revenue - ASC 606 $ 411,247 $ 376,665\nLease fixed revenue – ASC 842 18,680 15,015\nLease variable revenue - ASC 842 12,314 9,612\nTotal revenue $ 442,241 $ 401,292\nPractical Expedients Applied\nThe Company collects sales taxes when required from customers as part of the purchase price, which are then subsequently remitted to the appropriate authorities.\nThe Company has elected to apply the practical expedient that allows entities to make an accounting policy election to exclude sales taxes and other similar taxes from the\nmeasurement.\nAt contract inception, the Company does not expect the period between customer payment and transfer of control of the promised services to the customer to\nexceed one year as customers are invoiced with terms of 30 days. As such, the Company has used the practical expedient in ASC 606 which states that no adjustment for a\nsignificant financing component is necessary.\nTrade receivables and contract assets and liabilities\nTrade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts. Generally,\nthe Company does not require collateral for their accounts receivable; however, the Company may file statutory liens or take other appropriate legal action when necessary\non construction projects in which collection problems arise. A trade receivable is typically considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding\nfor more than 30 days. The Company does not charge interest on past-due trade receivables.\n51\nTable of Contents\nManagement determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts.\nTrade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received.\nThe Company does not have contract liabilities associated with contracts with customers. The Company’s contract assets and impairment losses associated\ntherewith are not significant. Contracts with customers do not result in amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue.\nPerformance obligations\nThe Company’s ASC 606 revenue is recognized primarily over time. Accordingly, in any particular period, we do not generally recognize a significant amount of\nrevenue from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods.\nContract costs\nThe Company incurs limited costs in order to obtain contracts. However, as the amortization period for these assets would be one year or less, the Company has\nelected the practical expedient permitted by ASC 606 and recognized those incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred. As discussed above,\ncontracts of the Company are typically completed within the year.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nRevenue disaggregated by reportable segment and geographic area where the work was performed for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 is\npresented in Note 19. The Company’s three reportable segments are U.S. Concrete Pumping, U.K. Operations and U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services.\nLeases\nLeases as Lessee\nThe Company primarily leases various office and land facilities, vehicles and general office equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not\nrecorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and whether that lease meets the classification criteria of a finance or operating lease in\naccordance with ASC 842, based on the terms and conditions in the contract. A contract contains a lease if there is an identified asset and we have the right to control the\nasset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease arrangements can take several forms. Some arrangements are clearly within the scope of lease accounting,\nsuch as a real estate contract that provides an explicit contractual right to use a building for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration. However, the right to\nuse an asset can also be conveyed through arrangements that are not leases in form, such as leases embedded within service and supply contracts. We analyze all\narrangements with potential embedded leases to determine if an identified asset is present, if substantive substitution rights are present, and if the arrangement provides the\ncustomer control of the asset. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets are recognized at the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities. Lease-related\nliabilities are recognized at the present value of the remaining expected future lease payments (see discussion below), which are discounted using the Company’s\nincremental borrowing rates as the rates implicit in the leases are not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rates used are based on the Company’s Senior Notes\nrates, adjusted to approximate the rates at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis over a term similar to the recognized lease term. The incremental borrowing rates\nare applied to each lease based upon the length of the lease term and the reporting entity in which the lease resides. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.\n52\nTable of Contents\nMany of the Company’s lease arrangements contain multiple lease components (including fixed payments, such as rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) and\nnon-lease components (including common-area maintenance (\"CAM\") costs). The Company has elected to not separate the lease and non-lease components for leases as\nlessee. All leases that contain CAM or pass-through components that are variable payments and are billed separate from the base payment for the lease are expensed as\nvariable lease expense in the period in which the obligation of these payments was incurred. Other leases that have a component of the base payment that is known to\ninclude CAM or other pass-through charges will not be separated and therefore are included in the analysis of the lease liability. Any true-ups or variable payments billed\nwill be expensed as variable lease expense when incurred.\nExpected Future Lease payments - The Company’s lease agreements contain a contractual minimum number of fixed lease payments, and many contain renewal\noptions. However, the Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for renewal periods unless at inception or when a triggering event occurs, it is determined\nthat it is reasonably certain the lease will be renewed. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive\ncovenants. Some of the Company’s lease agreements are on a month-to-month basis and the Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities until it is\ndetermined that it is reasonably certain the Company will have rights to the asset greater than 12 months. Based on this, the expected future lease payments that are\ndiscounted to arrive at the initial lease liability are reflective of (1) contractual minimum number of fixed lease payments plus (2) the contractually permitted renewals that\nare reasonably certain to be elected. Quarterly, the Company reviews the month-to-month agreements and agreements with renewal terms where it was previously\ndetermined the renewal was not reasonably certain.\nThese leases, with few exceptions, provide for escalations that are fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed-dollar or fixed-percentage increases) or inflation-based\nescalation clauses (such as those tied to the consumer price index). The lease term for most leases includes the initial non-cancelable term plus any term under renewal\noptions that are reasonably certain.\nThe Company, from time to time, will enter into subleases, but these are immaterial in nature. From the Company’s perspective, these items are not factored into\nthe value of the ROU asset, but are disclosed as an offset to expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nThe adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of operating ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $18.6 million as of November\n1, 2021. All capital leases under ASC 840 as of October 31, 2021 were converted and disclosed as finance leases under ASC 842 as of November 1, 2021.\nPractical Expedients Applied\nThe Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things (i) allowed it\nto carry forward the historical lease classification; (ii) did not require reassessment whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases under the new definition\nof a lease; and (iii) did not require the Company to reassess whether previously capitalized initial direct costs for any existing leases would qualify for capitalization under\nASC 842.\nThe Company has elected the short-term lease practical expedient, which excludes short-term leases from the scope of ASC 842. The Company will expense all\nshort-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company also elected the hindsight practical expedient regarding the likelihood of exercising a lessee purchase option or assessing any impairment of ROU\nassets for existing leases. For all leases as lessee, the Company has elected the expedient that allows the Company to not separate non-lease components from lease\ncomponents, but instead account for each separate lease component and the non-lease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. For\nleases as lessor, the Company cannot separate these components as the timing and pattern of transfer of the lease and service components are not the same. The Company\nbelieves these elections will not have a material impact on the ROU asset and lease liability.\n53\nTable of Contents\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company follows ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\"), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense,\nbased on estimated fair values, for all share-based awards made to employees and directors. The fair value of time-based only restricted stock awards and time-based only\nstock options with a $.01 exercise price are valued at the closing price of the Company's stock as of the date of the grant of these awards. The Company expenses the grant\ndate fair value of the award in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service periods on a straight-line basis. For stock awards that include a market-\nbased vesting condition, such as the trading price of the Company’s common stock exceeding certain price targets, the Company uses a Monte Carlo Simulation in\nestimating the fair value at grant date and recognizes compensation expense over the implied service period (median time to vest). Shares exercised are issued out of\nauthorized but not outstanding shares. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company complies with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial reporting for income taxes.\nThe Company computes deferred income tax assets and liabilities annually for differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities\nthat will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect\ntaxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In assessing the realizability of\ndeferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization\nof deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management\nconsiders the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carryback opportunities, and tax planning strategies in making the assessment.\nIncome tax expense includes both the current income taxes payable or refundable and the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The tax benefit\nfrom an uncertain tax position is only recognized in the consolidated balance sheet if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination. The\nCompany recognizes interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCamfaud files income tax returns in the U.K. Camfaud’s national statutes are generally open for one year following the statutory filing period.\nForeign currency translation and transactions\nThe functional currency of Camfaud is the Pound Sterling (GBP). The assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars\nusing the period end exchange rates for the periods presented, and the consolidated statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rate for the periods\npresented. Retained earnings are translated at historic rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of comprehensive income on the consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income and is the only component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The functional currency of our other subsidiaries is the\nUnited States Dollar.\nGains/(losses) from foreign currency translation of certain of the Company's intercompany balances during the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.6\nmillion and $(2.1) million, respectively, and were included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Since the U.S. and the U.K.\nprimarily transact within their respective currencies, gains/(losses) from foreign currency transactions are not material.\n54\nTable of Contents\nEarnings per share\nThe Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. For purposes of calculating earnings per share (“EPS”), a company\nthat has participating security holders (for example, holders of unvested restricted stock that have non-forfeitable dividend rights and the Company’s Series A Preferred\nStock) is required to utilize the two-class method for calculating EPS unless the treasury stock method results in lower EPS. The two-class method is an allocation of\nearnings/(loss) between the holders of common stock and a company’s participating security holders. Under the two-class method, earnings/(loss) for the reporting period\nis calculated by taking the net income (loss) for the period, less both the dividends declared in the period on participating securities (whether or not paid) and the dividends\naccumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) for the period. Our common shares outstanding are comprised of shareholder owned\ncommon stock and shares of unvested restricted stock held by participating security holders.\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding,\nexcluding participating shares. Diluted earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of shares as determined for basic earnings per share plus shares\npotentially issuable in conjunction with unvested restricted stock awards, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and shares of zero-dividend convertible\nperpetual preferred stock outstanding. Common stock equivalents are not included in the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation when their effect is antidilutive.\nAn anti-dilutive impact is an increase in earnings per share or a reduction in net loss per share resulting from the conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of\ncertain securities.\nBusiness combinations and asset acquisitions\nThe Company applies the principles provided in ASC 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC 805\"), to determine whether a transaction involves an asset acquisition or\na business combination.\nIf it is determined an acquisition is a business combination, tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and goodwill is\nrecognized to the extent the fair value of the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Transaction costs for business combinations are\nexpensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 805.\nIf it is determined an acquisition is an asset acquisition, the purchase consideration (which will include certain transaction costs) is allocated first to indefinite lived\nintangible assets (if applicable) based on their fair values with the remaining balance of purchase consideration being allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on\ntheir relative fair values.\nConcentrations\nAs of October 31, 2023 there were three primary vendors that the Company relied upon to purchase concrete pumping boom equipment. However, should the need\narise, there are alternate vendors who can provide concrete pumping boom equipment.\nCash balances held at financial institutions may, at times, be in excess of federally insured limits. The Company places its temporary cash balances in high-credit\nquality financial institutions.\nThe Company’s customer base is dispersed across the U.S. and U.K. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and requires\nno collateral to support credit sales. During the periods described above, no customer represented 10 percent or more of sales or trade receivables.\nNote 3. New Accounting Pronouncements\nNewly adopted accounting pronouncements\nASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) - In March\n2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects\nof) reference rate reform on financial reporting for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).\nSpecifically, to the extent the Company's debt agreements are modified to replace LIBOR with another interest rate index, ASU 2020-04 will permit the Company to\naccount for the modification as a continuation of the existing contract without additional analysis. Companies may generally elect to apply the guidance for periods that\ninclude March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Effective June 29, 2022, the Company transitioned all of its U.S. Dollar borrowings from LIBOR to the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). See Note 10 for further discussion.\n55\nTable of Contents\nASU 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”) - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which is codified in ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) and supersedes\ncurrent lease guidance in ASC 840, Leases. ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability for substantially all leases. The lease\nliability is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments while the ROU asset is similarly calculated and then adjusted for initial direct costs. In addition, ASC\n842 expands the disclosure requirements to increase the transparency and comparability of the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July\n2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases ASC 842: Targeted Improvements, which allows entities to initially apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and\nrecognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The new standard is effective for emerging growth\ncompanies that have elected to use private company adoption dates for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2022. The Company adopted the guidance for the year ended October 31, 2022, with an effective date of adoption of November 1, 2021. See Note 9 for\nfurther discussion.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective\nAccounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and\nSimplification Initiative issued in August 2018 – In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, which amends U.S. GAAP to reflect updates and simplifications to\ncertain disclosure requirements referred to FASB by the SEC. The targeted amendments incorporate 14 of the 27 disclosures referred by the SEC into Codification. Some of\nthe amendments represent clarifications to, or technical corrections of, the current requirements. ASU 2023-06 could move certain disclosures from the nonfinancial portions\nof SEC filings to the financial statement notes. Each amendment in ASU 2023-06 will only become effective if the SEC removes the related disclosure or presentation\nrequirement from its existing regulation by June 30, 2027. No amendments were effective at October 31, 2023. The Company is still currently evaluating the impact of the\nadoption of the new standard but does not expect a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”) - In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, which\nimproves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance\ninterim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure\nrequirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The purpose of the amendments is to enable investors to better\nunderstand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. This ASU is effective for public companies with annual periods beginning after December\n15, 2023, and interim periods within annual period beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt the guidance for the\nfiscal year ending October 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”) - In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, which requires disaggregated\ninformation about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing\nmore detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. This ASU is effective for public companies with annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt the guidance for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2025. The Company is currently\nevaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”) - In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, which, along with\nsubsequently issued related ASUs, requires financial assets (or groups of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be\ncollected, among other provisions. This ASU is effective for smaller reporting companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption\npermitted. The Company plans to adopt the guidance during the first quarter of the fiscal year ending October 31, 2024. The amendments of this ASU should be applied on\na modified retrospective basis to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effects adoption of this guidance will have on the consolidated financial\nstatements and anticipates the impacts to be immaterial.\nNote 4. Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nThe Company completed one asset acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and five acquisitions during fiscal 2022. All acquisitions either added\ncomplementary assets in markets in which the Company already operates or expanded the Company's footprint into adjacent markets. With the exception of the Coastal\nCarolina Pumping, Inc. (\"Coastal\") acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, all other transactions qualified as asset acquisitions. Except for the acquisition of\nPioneer Concrete Pumping Services (“Pioneer”) in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and Coastal in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, these acquisitions were not individually\nsignificant to our results of operations. The consideration for the acquisitions in fiscal 2022 consisted of cash and was allocated to the acquired long-lived tangible and\nintangible assets.\nAugust 2022 (Fiscal 2022) Coastal Acquisition\nIn August 2022, the Company acquired the property, equipment and intangible assets of Coastal for total purchase consideration of $30.8 million, which was paid\nfor using cash and the ABL Facility (defined below). This transaction expanded our operations in the Carolinas and Florida and qualified as a business combination under\nASC 805. Accordingly, the Company recorded all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. There was no goodwill recognized in this\ntransaction.\nThe following table represents the final allocation of consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition-date fair values with\nany measurement-period adjustments included:\n(in thousands)\nConsideration paid: $ 30,762\nNet assets acquired:\nIntangible assets $ 2,500\nProperty and equipment 28,500\nLiabilities assumed (238)\nTotal net assets acquired $ 30,762\nAll assets were valued using level 3 inputs. The equipment was valued using a market approach while the intangible assets were valued using an income approach\nbased on management’s projections.\n56\nTable of Contents\nIdentifiable intangible assets acquired consist of customer relationships of $1.7 million and non-compete agreements valued at $0.8 million. The customer\nrelationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. The non-compete agreements were valued using a direct valuation of economic damages\napproach. The Company determined the useful life of both the customer relationships and non-compete agreements to be 5 years.\nConcurrent with closing of the asset purchase agreement, the Company signed five leases directly with the seller. The leases were entered into at market rates and\nthe Company recognized an ROU asset and liability of $6.5 million related to these leases.\nNovember 2021 (Fiscal 2022) Pioneer Acquisition\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the assets, no cash, of Pioneer for total purchase consideration of $20.2 million, of which, $1.0 million was held back\n(the “Holdback”) to allow for a post-closing joint inspection of Pioneer’s fleet vehicles. The Holdback had not been paid out as of October 31, 2023. This transaction was\ntreated as an asset acquisition. The Company allocated $19.1 million to the purchase of Pioneer's equipment. The remaining $1.1 million was allocated to a definite-lived\nassembled workforce intangible asset and a definite-lived customer relationships intangible asset. All assets were valued using level 3 inputs. The equipment was valued\nusing a market approach while the intangible assets were valued using an income approach based on management’s projections. The intangible assets will be amortized over\n3 to 5 years.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs include expenses for legal, accounting, and other professionals that were engaged in connection with an asset acquisition or business\ncombination. Transaction costs in the twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 were immaterial.\n57\nTable of Contents\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations for the Company and gives effect to the Coastal business\ncombination discussed above as if it had occurred on November 1, 2020. The pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not\nnecessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized if the Coastal business combination had been completed on November 1, 2020, nor does it\npurport to project the results of operations of the combined company in future periods. The pro forma financial information does not give effect to any anticipated\nintegration costs related to the acquired company.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is as follows:\nYear Ended October\n(in thousands) 31, 2022\nRevenue $ 401,292\nPro forma revenue adjustments by Business Combination\nCoastal 15,986\nTotal pro forma revenue $ 417,278\nNet income $ 28,676\nPro forma net income adjustments by Business Combination\nCoastal 1,087\nTotal pro forma net income $ 29,763\nSignificant pro forma adjustments include:\n● Tangible and intangible assets are assumed to be recorded at their estimated fair values as of November 1, 2021 and are depreciated or amortized over their\nestimated useful lives; and\n● The Company incurred approximately $30.0 million on the ABL Facility (defined below) in connection with the acquisition of Coastal. Interest expense has\nbeen adjusted as of November 1, 2020.\nCoastal’s contribution to the Company's fiscal 2022 revenue was $4.0 million and net income was $0.6 million.\nNote 5. Fair Value Measurement\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and current accrued liabilities approximate their fair\nvalue as recorded due to the short-term maturity of these instruments, which approximates fair value. The Company’s outstanding obligations on its asset-backed loan\n(\"ABL\") credit facility are deemed to be at fair value as the interest rates on these debt obligations are variable and consistent with prevailing rates. There were no changes\nsince October 31, 2022 in the company's valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value of the ABL credit facility is derived from Level 2 inputs. The\ncarrying values of the Company's finance lease obligations represent fair value. The only transfer in financial instruments between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nduring the year ended October 31, 2022 was changing the warrants from Level 1 to Level 2 due to inactivity in trading. There were no changes for the year ended October\n31, 2023.\n58\nTable of Contents\nLong-term debt instruments\nThe Company's long-term debt instruments are recorded at their carrying values in the consolidated balance sheet, which may differ from their respective fair\nvalues. The fair values of the long-term debt instruments are derived from Level 2 inputs. The fair value amount of the long-term debt instruments as of October 31, 2023\nand 2022 is presented in the table below based on the prevailing interest rates and trading activity of the Senior Notes.\nAs of October 31, As of October 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\nSenior Notes $ 375,000 $ 353,438 $ 375,000 $ 339,375\nWarrants\nAs of October 31, 2023 and 2022, there were 13,017,677 public warrants and no private warrants outstanding, respectively. Each warrant entitles its holder to\npurchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The warrants expired on December 6, 2023.\nThe Company accounts for the public warrants issued in connection with its IPO in accordance with ASC 815, under which certain provisions in the public warrant\nagreements do not meet the criteria for equity classification and therefore these warrants must be recorded as liabilities. The fair value of each public warrant is based on the\npublic trading price of the warrant (Level 2 fair value measurement). Gains and losses related to the warrants are reflected in the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in\nthe consolidated statements of operations, see Note 2 for further discussion.\nAll other non-financial assets\nThe Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, are not required to be carried at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value\nmay not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles), non-financial instruments are assessed for impairment and, if applicable,\nwritten down to and recorded at fair value.\nNote 6. Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nThe significant components of prepaid expenses and other current assets at October 31, 2023 and 2022 are comprised of the following:\nAs of October 31, As of October 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nExpected recoveries related to self-insured commercial liabilities $ 3,802 $ -\nPrepaid insurance 1,611 1,550\nPrepaid licenses and deposits 810 751\nPrepaid rent 629 402\nOther current assets and prepaids 1,849 2,472\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 8,701 $ 5,175\n59\nTable of Contents\nNote 7. Property, Plant and Equipment\nThe significant components of property, plant and equipment as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 are comprised of the following:\nAs of October 31, As of October 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nLand, building and improvements $ 29,338 $ 28,528\nFinance leases—land and buildings 828 828\nMachinery and equipment 517,514 478,162\nTransportation equipment 9,306 7,133\nFurniture and office equipment 3,817 3,870\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross 560,803 518,521\nLess accumulated depreciation (133,155) (99,144)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 427,648 $ 419,377\nDepreciation expense for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nCost of operations $ 37,336 $ 32,608\nGeneral and administrative expenses 2,420 2,326\nTotal depreciation expense $ 39,756 $ 34,934\nNote 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company has recognized goodwill and certain intangible assets in connection with prior business combinations. The Company performed a qualitative test as\nof the annual impairment testing date of August 31, 2023 and there were no impairment indicators present. As of October 31, 2023, no triggering events were identified. The\nCompany performed a quantitative impairment analysis as of August 31, 2022. Based on the results of this analysis the fair values of the Company's reporting units were in\nexcess of their carrying values and as such, no impairments were identified.\nThe valuation methodology used to value the trade names during the quantitative impairment analysis as of August 31, 2022, was based on the relief-from-royalty\nmethod which is an income based measure that derives the value from total revenue growth projected and what percentage is attributable to the trade names. As a result of\nthe analysis, the Company identified that the fair value of its Brundage-Bone Concrete Pumping, Eco-Pan and Capital Pumping trade names exceeded their carrying values\nby approximately 61%, 49% and 127%, respectively, and their remaining values are $37.3 million, $7.7 million and $5.5 million as of October 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe goodwill impairment test performed as of August 31, 2022, was performed on the Company’s U.S. Concrete Pumping, U.S. Concrete Waste Management\nServices, and U.K. Operations reporting units. The valuation methodologies used to value the reporting units included the discounted cash flow method (income approach)\nand the guideline public company method (market approach). As a result of the goodwill impairment analysis, the Company identified that the fair values of its U.S.\nConcrete Pumping, U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services and U.K. Operations reporting units were approximately 7%, 82% and 32% greater than their carrying\nvalues, respectively. As such, no impairment charge was recorded.\n60\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the composition of intangible assets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAs of October 31,\n2023\nWeighted Foreign\nAverage Gross Currency Net\nRemaining Life Carrying Accumulated Accumulated Translation Carrying\n(in thousands) (in Years) Value Impairment Amortization Adjustment Amount\nIntangibles subject to amortization:\nCustomer relationship 10.1 $ 195,126 $ - $ (130,295) $ 832 $ 65,663\nTrade name 5.1 5,097 - (2,645) 146 2,598\nAssembled workforce 1.4 1,650 - (972) - 678\nNoncompete agreements 3.9 1,200 - (395) - 805\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets:\nTrade names (indefinite life) - 55,500 (5,000) - - 50,500\nTotal intangibles $ 258,573 $ (5,000) $ (134,307) $ 978 $ 120,244\nAs of October 31,\n2022\nWeighted Foreign\nAverage Gross Currency Net\nRemaining Life Carrying Accumulated Accumulated Translation Carrying\n(in thousands) (in Years) Value Impairment Amortization Adjustment Amount\nIntangibles subject to amortization:\nCustomer relationship 11.0 $ 193,710 $ - $ (112,658) $ 1,416 $ 82,468\nTrade name 6.1 4,836 - (2,127) 239 2,948\nAssembled workforce 2.1 1,450 - (444) - 1,006\nNoncompete agreements 4.6 1,000 - (168) - 832\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets:\nTrade names (indefinite life) - 55,500 (5,000) - - 50,500\nTotal intangibles $ 256,496 $ (5,000) $ (115,397) $ 1,655 $ 137,754\nAmortization expense for the year ended October 31, 2023 was $18.9 million.

As such, the Company has provided U.S. deferred taxes on\ncumulative earnings of all of its non-U.S. affiliates.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary\ndifferences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carryback opportunities, and tax\nplanning strategies in making the assessment. The Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the\nvaluation allowance provided. The valuation allowance provided by the Company relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards, certain state tax credit carryforwards, and state\nnet operating loss carryforwards.\nThe Company files income tax returns with the U.S., various state governments and the U.K. With few immaterial exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to\nU.S. federal, foreign and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before October 31, 2021.\nPursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382, annual use of the Company’s NOL carryforwards may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of\nmore than 50% occurs within a three-year period.

When a recognized liability is covered by\nthird-party insurance, the Company records an insurance claim receivable to reflect the covered liability. Amounts estimated to be paid within one year have been included\nin Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, with the remainder included in Other liabilities, non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Insurance claims\nreceivables that are expected to be received from third-party insurance within one year have been included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, with the remainder\nincluded in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table summarizes as of October 31, 2023 for (1) recorded liabilities, related to both asserted as well as unasserted insurance claims and (2) any\nrelated insurance claims receivables.\nAs of October 31,\n2023\n(in thousands) Classification on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nSelf-insured commercial liability, current Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 11,087\nSelf-insured commercial liability, non-current Other liabilities, non-current 14,140\nTotal self-insured commercial liabilities 25,227\nExpected recoveries related to self-insured commercial liabilities, current Prepaid expenses and other current assets 3,802\nExpected recoveries related to self-insured commercial liabilities, non-current Other non-current assets 13,822\nTotal expected recoveries related to self-insured commercial liabilities 17,625\nTotal self-insured commercial liability, net of expected recoveries $ 7,602\nThe Company has accrued $7.6 million and $7.0 million, as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for estimated (1) losses reported and (2) claims incurred\nbut not reported, net of recoveries.\nMedical Self-Insured Losses\nThe Company offers employee health benefits via a partially self-insured medical benefit plan. Participant claims exceeding certain limits are covered by a stop-\nloss insurance policy. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had accrued $1.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for estimated health claims incurred but not\nreported based on historical claims amounts and average lag time. These accruals are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets. The Company contracts with a third-party administrator to process claims, remit benefits, etc. The third-party administrator required the\nCompany to maintain a bank account to facilitate the administration of claims.\nLitigation\nThe Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and other disputes with third parties that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.\nManagement believes that the outcomes of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and does not believe that any amounts need\nto be recorded for contingent liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\nEffective April 1, 2020, the state of Washington Department of Revenue (“DOR”) published a rule which effectively deems the provision of standalone concrete\npumping services as a retail sale subject to sales tax. The Company does not charge sales tax to its customers that provide a reseller certificate, treating this as a wholesale\ntransaction rather than as a retail sale. As such, for the period from April 1, 2020 through October 31, 2023, the Company has continued to not charge sales tax where its\ncustomers provide a reseller certificate and has petitioned for declaratory relief from the rule. In February 2023, the Company received an adverse ruling from the Thurston\nCounty superior court regarding its position, which it has appealed and oral argument is scheduled for February 2024 in the Court of Appeals in Tacoma. The Company\nbelieves there is a basis for its position that standalone concrete pumping services provided to a wholesale reseller, rather than to a retail customer, is not a retail sale, and\ncontests the adverse ruling in its appeal. As of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, no liability has been recorded in connection with the adverse ruling. If the Company is\nnot successful in its arguments against the DOR in its appeal, an estimated $3.5 million in sales tax, inclusive of interest and penalties, may be owed and would be accrued\nin the quarter in which the court makes any unfavorable determination.\nLetters of credit\nThe ABL Facility provides for up to $22.5 million of standby letters of credit. As of October 31, 2023, total outstanding letters of credit totaled $4.1 million, the\nvast majority of which had been committed to the Company’s general liability insurance provider.\n70\nTable of Contents\nNote 15. Stockholders’ Equity\nThe Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, and\n10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001. Immediately following December 6, 2018, there were:\n● 28,847,707 shares of common stock issued and outstanding;\n● 34,100,000 warrants outstanding, each exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share; and\n● 2,450,980 shares of zero-dividend convertible perpetual preferred stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) outstanding, as further discussed below\nGrants of new restricted stock awards and exercises of stock options are issued out of outstanding and available common stock.\nAs discussed below, on April 29, 2019, 2,101,213 shares of common stock were issued in exchange for the Company's public warrants and 1,707,175 shares of\ncommon stock were issued in exchange for the Company's private warrants. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, there were 13,017,677 public warrants outstanding,\nrespectively. These warrants expired on December 6, 2033.\nOn May 14, 2019, in order to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Capital, the Company completed a public offering of 18,098,166 of its\ncommon stock at a price of $4.50 per share, receiving net proceeds of approximately $77.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering\nexpenses. In connection with the offering, certain of the Company’s directors, officers and significant stockholders, and certain other related investors purchased an\naggregate of 3,980,166 shares of its common stock from the underwriters at the public offering price of $4.50, representing approximately 25% of the total shares issued\n(without giving effect to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares).\nThe Company’s Series A Preferred Stock does not pay dividends and is convertible (effective June 6, 2019) into shares of the Company’s common stock at a 1:1\nratio (subject to customary adjustments). The Company has the right to elect to redeem all or a portion of the Series A Preferred Stock at its election after December 6, 2022\nfor cash at a redemption price equal to the amount of the principal investment ($25,000,000) plus an additional cumulative amount that will accrue at an annual rate of 7.0%\nthereon. As of October 31, 2023, the additional cumulative amount totaled $8.8 million which would be recognized when redemption is probable. The Series A Preferred\nStock will rank senior in priority and will have a senior liquidation preference to the Common Stock. In addition, if the volume weighted average price of shares of the\nCompany’s common stock equals or exceeds $13.00 for 30 consecutive days, then the Company will have the right to require the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock to\nconvert its Series A Preferred Stock into Company common stock, at a ratio of 1:1 (subject to customary adjustments such as adjustments for anti-dilution events for\ninstance stock splits or reverse stock split).\nConditionally redeemable preferred shares (including preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to\nredemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. The preferred stock contains a redemption\nfeature contingent upon a change in control which is not solely within the control of the Company. As such, the preferred stock is presented outside of permanent equity.\n71\nTable of Contents\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn January 2023, the board of directors of the Company approved a $10.0 million increase to the Company’s share repurchase program. This authorization will\nexpire on March 31, 2024 and is in addition to the repurchase authorization of up to $10.0 million through June 15, 2023 that was previously approved in June 2022. The\nrepurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in the open market, by block purchase, in privately negotiated transactions, in one or more transactions from time to\ntime, or pursuant to any trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”). Open market\npurchases will be conducted in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The\nrepurchase program may be suspended, terminated, extended or otherwise modified by the Board without notice at any time for any reason, including, without limitation,\nmarket conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, capital and liquidity objectives, and other factors deemed\nappropriate by the Company's management.\nThe following table summarizes the shares repurchased, total cost of shares repurchased and average price per share for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 and\n2022. All repurchases were at market value.\nFor the Year Ended October 31,\n(in thousands, except price per share) 2023 2022\nShares repurchased 1,333 415\nTotal cost of shares repurchased $ 8,883 $ 2,700\nAverage price per share $ 6.66 $ 6.48\nNote 16. Stock-Based Compensation\nPursuant to the Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Company granted stock-based awards to certain employees in the U.S. and\nU.K. All awards in the U.S. are restricted stock awards while awards granted to employees in the U.K. are stock options with exercise prices of $0.01. Regardless of where\nthe awards were granted, the awards generally vest pursuant to one of the following four conditions:\n(1) Time-based only – Awards vest in equal installments over a specified period.\n(2) $6 market-based and time-based vesting – Awards will vest as to first condition once the Company’s stock reaches a closing price of $6.00 for 30 consecutive\ntrading days. Once the first vesting condition is achieved, the stock award will then vest 1/3 annually over a three-year period.\n(3) $8 market-based and time-based vesting – Awards will vest as to first condition once the Company’s stock reaches a closing price of $8.00 for 30 consecutive\ntrading days. Once the first vesting condition is achieved, the stock award will then vest 1/3 annually over a three-year period.\n(4) $10 market-based and time-based vesting – Awards will vest as to first condition once the Company’s stock reaches a closing price of $10.00 for 30\nconsecutive trading days. Once the first vesting condition is achieved, the stock award will then vest 1/3 annually over a three-year period.\nThe following table summarizes realized compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations:\nTwelve Months Ended October 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nCompensation expense – stock options $ 465 $ 611\nCompensation expense – restricted stock awards 3,382 4,423\nTotal $ 3,847 $ 5,034\n72\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nThe following tables summarize stock option activity for the year ended October 31, 2023:\nWeighted average Weighted average\nOptions grant date fair value exercise price\nOutstanding stock options, October 31, 2021 1,684,193 $ 6.85 $ 1.63\nGranted 4,500 $ 7.43 $ 0.01\nCancelled/Forfeited (1,586) $ 6.67 $ 0.01\nExercised (197,779) $ 6.70 $ 0.44\nOutstanding stock options, October 31, 2022 1,489,328 $ 6.42 $ 1.79\nExercised (112,774) $ 6.71 $ 0.39\nOutstanding stock options, October 31, 2023 1,376,554 $ 6.40 $ 1.90\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.

Earnings Per Share\nAt October 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding (1) 13.0 million warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50, (2) 1.5 million\noutstanding unvested restricted stock awards, (3) 1.1 million outstanding unexercised incentive stock options, (4) 0.4 million outstanding unexercised non-qualified stock\noptions, and (5) 2.5 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock, all of which could potentially be dilutive. The dilutive effect of the warrants and the preferred stock were\nexcluded from the calculation of the diluted net income per share for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 as its impact would have been anti-dilutive.\n74\nTable of Contents\nThe table below shows our basic and diluted EPS calculations for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended October 31,\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2023 2022\nNet income (numerator):\nNet income attributable to Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. $ 31,790 $ 28,676\nLess: Accretion of liquidation preference on preferred stock (1,750) (1,750)\nLess: Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (1,017) (1,274)\nNet income attributable to common stockholders (numerator for basic earnings per share) $ 29,023 $ 25,652\nAdd back: Undistributed earning allocated to participating securities 1,017 1,274\nLess: Undistributed earnings reallocated to participating securities (1,000) (1,254)\nNumerator for diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 29,040 $ 25,672\nWeighted average shares (denominator):\nWeighted average shares - basic 53,276,450 53,914,311\nWeighted average shares - diluted 54,173,731 54,851,308\nBasic earnings (loss) per share $ 0.54 $ 0.48\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share $ 0.54 $ 0.47\nNote 18. Employee Benefits Plan\nRetirement plans\nThe Company offers a 401(k) plan, which covers substantially all employees in the U.S., with the exception of certain union employees. Participating employees\nmay elect to contribute, on a tax-deferred basis, a portion of their compensation, in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company generally\nprovides some form of a matching contribution for most employees in the U.S. Retirement plan contributions for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.7\nmillion and $0.9 million respectively.\nCamfaud operates a Small Self-Administered Scheme (“SSAS”), which is the equivalent of a U.S. defined contribution pension plan. The assets of the plan are\nheld separately from those of Camfaud in an independently administered fund. Contributions by Camfaud to the SSAS amounted to $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the\nyears ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nMultiemployer plans\nOur U.S. Concrete Pumping segment contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements\n(CBAs) that cover its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following\naspects: (a) Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (b) If a\nparticipating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and (c) If we choose to\nstop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a\nwithdrawal liability. We have no intention of stopping our participation in any multiemployer plan.\n75\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a summary of our contributions to each multiemployer pension plan for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended October 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nCalifornia $ 606 $ 407\nOregon 303 291\nWashington 301 255\nTotal contributions $ 1,210 $ 953\nNo plan was determined to be individually significant. There have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of the contributions. The Company\nreviews the funded status of each multiemployer defined benefit pension plan at each reporting period to monitor the certified zone status for each of the multiemployer\ndefined benefit pension plans. The zone status for the multiemployer defined benefit pension plan for Oregon and Washington were Green(greater than 80 percent funded)\nand for California, it was Yellow (less than 80 percent funded but greater than 65 percent funded).\nGovernment regulations impose certain requirements relative to multiemployer plans. In the event of plan termination or employer withdrawal, an employer may\nbe liable for a portion of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits. We have not received information from the plans’ administrators to determine its share of unfunded vested\nbenefits. We do not anticipate withdrawal from the plans, nor are we aware of any expected plan terminations.\nIf the construction industry exception applies, then it would delay the imposition of a withdrawal liability. The “construction industry” exception generally delays\nthe imposition of withdrawal liability in connection with an employer’s withdrawal from a “construction industry” multiemployer plan unless and until that employer\nresumes covered operations in the relevant geographic region without a corresponding resumption of contributions to the multiemployer plan. The Company has no\nintention of withdrawing, in either a complete or partial withdrawal, from any of the multiemployer plans to which the Company currently contributes; however, it has been\nassessed a withdrawal liability in the past.\nNote 19. Segment Reporting\nThe Company conducts business through the following reportable segments based on geography and the nature of services sold:\n● U.S. Concrete Pumping – Consists of concrete pumping services sold to customers in the U.S. Business in this segment is primarily performed under the\nBrundage-Bone and Capital trade names.\n● U.K. Operations – Consists of concrete pumping services and leasing of concrete pumping equipment to customers in the U.K. Business in this segment is\nprimarily performed under the Camfaud Concrete Pumps and Premier Concrete Pumping trade names. In addition to concrete pumping, we recently started\noperations of waste management services in the U.K. under the Eco-Pan trade name and the results of this business are included in this segment. This\nrepresents the Company’s foreign operations.\n● U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services – Consists of pans and containers rented to customers in the U.S. and the disposal of the concrete waste\nmaterial services sold to customers in the U.S. Business in this segment is performed under the Eco-Pan trade name.\nAny differences between segment reporting and consolidated results are reflected in Intersegment or Other below. All Other non-segmented revenues and costs that\nare not allocated to other reportable segments include intercompany eliminations, non-allocated depreciation, and the change in the fair value of the warrant liability. All\nOther non-segmented assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents, intercompany eliminations and real property.\n76\nTable of Contents\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”)\nevaluates the performance of each segment based on revenue, and measures segment performance based upon EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization). Non-allocated interest expense and various other administrative costs are reflected in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily include cash and cash\nequivalents, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and real property.

Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2023 (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures\nare designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.\nBased upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Office and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of October 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, utilizing the criteria described in the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, our management\nconcluded that, as of October 31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\n79\nTable of Contents\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended\nOctober 31, 2023 and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, as stated in their report which appears under Item\n8.\nRemediation of Prior Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal periods\nended July 31, 2022, January 31, 2023, April 30, 2023, and July 31, 2023, we identified the following material weaknesses: (1) the review of manual journal entries within\nthe financial statement close process, which was identified in connection with the restatement of the Company’s interim unaudited financial statements as of July 31, 2022\n(\"MW #1\"); and (2) the areas of user access and segregation of duties related to information technology systems that support the financial reporting process specifically\nrelated to accounts payable and expenditures (\"MW #2\").\nAs previously disclosed, the Company has designed and implemented measures in order to remediate the identified material weaknesses. Regarding MW #1, the\nCompany developed and implemented its remediation plan by enhancing the Company’s internal control environment with incremental controls, increasing training for\naccounting team members and improving the schedules used for the preparation of complex journal entries. Regarding MW #2, the Company developed and implemented\nits remediation plan by updating user access and segregation of duties matrices and implementing reviews of user activity reports. As of October 31, 2023, these enhanced\nprocedures and control activities operated for a sufficient period of time in order for management to conclude, through testing, that the Company’s enhanced controls\noperated effectively. As such, the Company concluded that the previously reported material weaknesses have been remediated as of October 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the remediation of material weaknesses as discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in\nconnection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended October 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n80\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

OVERVIEW\nIn accordance with the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq Rules”), Section 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”) (“Rule 10D-1”), the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted this Policy (the\n“Policy”) to provide for the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from Executive Officers. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise\ndefined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section H, below.\nB. RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\n1. In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will reasonably promptly recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received in\naccordance with Nasdaq Rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows:\ni. After an Accounting Restatement, the Compensation Committee (if composed entirely of independent directors, or in the absence of such a\ncommittee, a majority of independent directors serving on the Board) (the “Committee”) shall determine the amount of any Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation Received by each Executive Officer and shall promptly notify each Executive Officer with a written notice\ncontaining the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return of such compensation, as\napplicable.\na. For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return, where the\namount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the\napplicable Accounting Restatement:\ni. The amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of\nthe Accounting Restatement on the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based\nCompensation was Received; and\nii. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant\ndocumentation as required to the Nasdaq.\nii. The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the\nparticular facts and circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Section B(2) below, in no event may the Company\naccept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer’s obligations\nhereunder.\niii. To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received under any\nduplicative recovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be\ncredited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\niv. To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company shall\ntake all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The\napplicable Executive Officer shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by\nthe Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n2. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Section B(1) above if the\nCommittee (which, as specified above, is composed entirely of independent directors or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the\nindependent directors serving on the Board) determines that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following two conditions are met:\ni. The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be\nrecovered. Before making this determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation, documented such attempt(s) and provided such documentation to the Nasdaq; or\nii. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nCompany, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and\nregulations thereunder.\nC. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and rules.\nD. PROHIBITION OF INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned\nor recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Company shall not\nenter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of this Policy or\nthat waives the Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before,\non or after the Effective Date of this Policy).\nE. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy\nand for the Company’s compliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq\npromulgated or issued in connection therewith.\nF. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section F to\nthe contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the\nCompany contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule or Nasdaq rule.\nG. OTHER RECOVERY RIGHTS\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable law or guidance from the SEC or NASDAQ, their\nbeneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. The Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by\napplicable law. Any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or any other agreement or arrangement with an Executive Officer shall be\ndeemed to include, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by the Executive Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery\nunder this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation or\nrule or pursuant to the terms of any policy of the Company or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement or\nother arrangement.\nH.
