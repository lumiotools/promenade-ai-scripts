The general market conditions we highlighted at that time continue and are\nreflected in our maintained FY 2024 outlook.\nDespite these near-term competitive headwinds, we remain firm in our belief that SUBLOCADE has a differentiated\nand optimal profile for opioid use disorder patients, particularly with the ongoing proliferation of potent synthetic\nopioids. Furthermore, as highlighted at our business update, evidence among multiple co-prescribing cohorts since\nthe competitor’s launch supports our belief that SUBLOCADE will retain a leadership position in the long-acting\ninjectable category, with SUBLOCADE share currently in the mid-60s percent range across these cohorts. Looking\nahead, with continued strong execution supplemented by important potential FDA label updates, we expect to\nmove beyond this near-term period of market disruption to ultimately deliver SUBLOCADE peak net revenue of\ngreater than $1.5 billion.\nTo further support our goal, we are pursuing significant streamlining actions across both G&A and R&D, including\ntermination of pipeline activities outside of OUD assets which are committed and underway. The savings from\nthese efforts will be used to fuel SUBLOCADE growth, fund year-over-year incremental investment behind our two\nPhase 2 OUD assets and underpin our focus on supporting Group margins. Taken together, we expect to deliver a\nnet reduction in overall operating expense in FY 2025 of $10 million to $20 million when compared to the mid-\npoint of FY 2024 operating expense guidance.\nLastly, we continue to address legacy litigation to create greater certainty for all stakeholders. Our third quarter\nresults include a $39 million provision for the preliminary agreement related to the remaining parties in the legacy\nantitrust litigation. While the parties must negotiate material terms and conditions of the final settlement\nagreement, when finalized this will close this legacy matter.\"\n1\nYTD/ Q3 2024 Financial Highlights\n• YTD 2024 total net revenue (NR) of $889m increased 11% (YTD 2023: $800m); Q3 2024 total NR of $307m\nincreased 13% (Q3 2023: $271m).\n• YTD 2024 reported operating loss was $64m (YTD 2023 operating loss: $65m); Q3 2024 reported operating\nprofit was $4m (Q3 2023 operating loss: $183m). YTD 2024 adjusted operating profit of $245m increased 21%\n(Adjusted YTD 2023: $202m). Q3 2024 adjusted operating profit of $97m increased 62% (Adjusted Q3 2023:\n$60m).\n• YTD 2024 reported net loss was $57m (YTD 2023 net loss: $52m); Q3 2024 reported net income was $4m (Q3\n2023 net loss: $135m). YTD 2024 adjusted net income of $182m increased 12% (Adjusted YTD 2023: $162m).\nQ3 2024 adjusted net income of $72m increased 47% (Adjusted Q3 2023: $49m).\n• Cash and investments totaled $344m at September 30, 2024 (including $26m investments restricted for self-\ninsurance) (FY 2023: $451m). The decrease was primarily due to the Group's litigation settlement payments of\n$158m and share repurchases of $122m, partly offset by cash flow from operating activities.\nYTD/ Q3 2024 Product Highlights\n• SUBLOCADE (buprenorphine extended release) Injection: YTD 2024 NR of $562m (+24% vs. YTD 2023); Q3\n2024 NR of $191m (+14% vs. Q3 2023 and (1)% vs. Q2 2024). Year-over-year growth primarily reflects\ncontinued volume growth in Organized Health System and Criminal Justice System channels in the U.S. Q3\n2024 U.S. units dispensed were approx. 158,500 (+19% vs. Q3 2023 and +2% vs. Q2 2024). Total U.S. patients\non a 12-month rolling basis at the end of Q3 2024 were approximately 166,600 (+37% vs. Q3 2023 and +4% vs.\nQ2 2024).\n• OPVEE® (nalmefene) nasal spray: Q3 2024 NR of $15m comprised of two 100,000 unit orders from the U.S.\nBiomedical Advancement Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Near-term launch focus is on\nsupporting policy changes to enable nalmefene opioid rescue treatment and increasing product trial among\ntargeted users.\n• SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine/naloxone) Film: U.S. share in Q3 2024 averaged 15% (Q3 2023: 18%).\n• PERSERIS® (risperidone) extended release injection: YTD 2024 NR of $31m and Q3 2024 NR of $8m. As\npreviously announced, sales and marketing of PERSERIS have been discontinued.\n• INDV-1000 (Alcohol Use Disorder): discontinuing development of preclinical GABA-b Positive Allosteric\nModulator.\nFY 2024 Guidance\nOn October 10th, the Group updated its financial guidance for FY 2024 as detailed below.\nGuidance assumes no material change in exchange rates for key currencies compared with FY 2023 average rates,\nnotably USD/GBP and USD/EUR.\nFY 2024\nNet Revenue (NR) $1,125m to $1,165m\n(+5% at midpoint vs. FY 2023)\nSUBLOCADE NR $725m to $745m\n(+17% at midpoint vs. FY 2023)\nOPVEE NR Approximately $15m\nPERSERIS NR1 $32m to $37m\nSUBOXONE Film Market Share Assumes historic rate of share decline in FY 2024 of\n1 to 2 percentage points and the potential impact\nfrom a fourth buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual\nfilm generic in the U.S. market\nAdjusted Gross Margin Low to mid-80s % range\nAdjusted SG&A ($555m) to ($560m)\nR&D ($115m) to ($120m)\nAdjusted Operating Profit $260m to $280m\n(midpoint flat vs. FY 2023)\n1\nAs previously announced, sales and marketing of PERSERIS have been discontinued.\n2\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn July 25, 2024, Indivior announced a new non-discretionary $100m share repurchase program that commenced\non August 5, 2024. Through October 11, the Group repurchased and canceled 4,862k Indivior ordinary shares as\npart of this program, equivalent to approximately 4% of diluted shares outstanding, at a daily weighted average\npurchase price of 839p. The cost was approximately $53m, which includes directly attributable transaction cost.\nThis program is targeted to be completed by January 31, 2025.\nExpected settlement reached with certain end payors to resolve remaining antitrust cases\nIndivior continues to address legacy litigation to create greater certainty for all stakeholders. Today, the Group\nannounces an expected settlement of the last remaining antitrust litigation with (i) Humana, Inc. and certain of its\naffiliates (collectively, “Humana”) and (ii) with Centene Corporation, Wellcare Healthcare Plans, Inc., New York\nQuality Healthcare Corp. (d/b/a Fidelis Care), and Health Net, LLC (collectively, “Centene”). The Group has\nrecorded a provision of $39m reflecting the net present value (NPV) at the risk-free rate of the agreed amounts to\nbe paid in 2024 and 2025. The parties to the settlement still must negotiate material terms and conditions of the\nfinal settlement agreement, which Indivior expects to resolve shortly. Final settlement, if reached, would resolve\nall of the Group’s remaining legacy antitrust litigation, including all claims in the Kentucky and Pennsylvania state\ncourt actions filed by Humana, and all claims in the Virginia state court action filed by Centene.\nU.S. OUD Market Update\nIn Q3 2024, U.S. buprenorphine medication-assisted treatments (BMAT) grew in mid-single digits in volume terms.\nThe Group continues to expect long-term U.S. growth to be sustained in the mid- to high-single digit percentage\nrange due to increased overall public awareness of the opioid epidemic and approved treatments, together with\nregulatory and legislative actions.\nFinancial Performance in YTD/Q3 2024\nTotal NR in YTD 2024 increased 11% to $889m (YTD 2023: $800m) at actual exchange rates (+11% at constant\nexchange rates1). In Q3 2024, total NR increased 13% to $307m (Q3 2023: $271m) at actual exchange rates (+13%\nat constant exchange rates1).\nU.S. NR increased 14% in YTD 2024 to $755m (YTD 2023: $662m) and by 15% in Q3 2024 to $261m (Q3 2023:\n$227m). Double-digit year-over-year SUBLOCADE volume growth and the fulfillment of OPVEE orders from BARDA\nprimarily drove the increases in NR in both periods. Q3 2024 NR also benefited from updates to channel mix and\ntrade spend estimations for both SUBLOCADE and SUBOXONE Film. These benefits were partially offset by\nSUBLOCADE trade destocking versus stocking in the year-ago quarter. Pricing was not material to NR growth.\nRest of World (ROW) NR decreased 3% at actual exchange rates in YTD 2024 to $134m (YTD 2023: $138m) (-3% at\nconstant exchange rates1). Positive contributions from new products (SUBLOCADE / SUBUTEX® Prolonged Release\nand SUBOXONE Film) were more than offset by the ongoing generic erosion of the legacy tablet business and the\ntiming of shipments. In Q3 2024, ROW NR increased 5% at actual exchange rates to $46m (Q3 2023: $44m) (2% at\nconstant exchange rates1) mainly reflecting positive contributions from new products that were partially offset by\ngeneric erosion of legacy tablet business. YTD 2024 SUBLOCADE / SUBUTEX Prolonged Release NR increased 27%\nto $38m (YTD 2023: $30m) and in Q3 2024 increased 30% to $13m (Q3 2023: $10m), all at actual exchange rates.\nGross margin as reported in YTD 2024 was 77% (YTD 2023: 83%) and 78% in Q3 2024 (Q3 2023: 83%). YTD 2024\nand Q3 2024 included $51m and $10m, respectively, of costs related to the discontinuation of sales and marketing\nfor PERSERIS. In addition, adjustments for amortization of acquired intangible assets within cost of sales of $9m in\nYTD 2024 and $3m in Q3 2024 were also included in the reported gross margin. Excluding these costs and\nadjustments, adjusted gross margin was 83% and 82% in YTD 2024 and Q3 2024, respectively (both YTD 2023 and\nQ3 2023: 84%). The decrease in adjusted gross margin in both YTD period and quarter primarily reflects cost\ninflation and favorable pricing on specified batches produced in Q3 2023 that did not repeat in Q3 2024 partially\noffset by a transitory benefit relating to the BARDA agreement that will reverse in future periods and an improved\nproduct mix from the continued growth of SUBLOCADE.\nSG&A expenses as reported in YTD 2024 were $665m (YTD 2023: $654m) and $208m in Q3 2024 (Q3 2023:\n$390m). YTD 2024 and Q3 2024 included $244m and $75m of exceptional items, respectively (YTD 2023 and Q3\n2023: $262m and $240m, respectively). See \"Appendix\" for adjusted results for details of exceptional SG&A\nexpenses for YTD and Q3 2024 and 2023.\n1 Net revenue at constant exchange rates is an alternative performance measure used by management to evaluate underlying performance of\nthe business and is calculated by applying the prior year exchange rate to current year net revenue in the currencies of the foreign entities.\n3\nExcluding exceptional items, YTD 2024 adjusted SG&A expense increased 7% to $421m (Adjusted YTD 2023:\n$392m), reflecting increased sales and marketing related to SUBLOCADE and the launch of OPVEE, as well as cost\ninflation; Q3 2024 adjusted SG&A expense decreased 11% to $133m (Adjusted Q3 2023: $150m), primarily\nreflecting lower expenses from the discontinuation of PERSERIS, as well as lower legal and other administrative\nexpenses.\nR&D expenses in YTD 2024 and Q3 2024 were $76m and $22m, respectively (YTD 2023: $77m; Q3 2023: $18m),\nand represented a decrease of 1% and an increase of 22%, respectively. The modest decrease in the YTD period\nwas primarily due to lower activity related to post-marketing studies for SUBLOCADE offset by pipeline\nadvancement activities principally related to Phase 2 studies for INDV-2000 and INDV-6001. The increase in Q3\n2024 primarily reflects the aforementioned pipeline advancement activities for INDV-2000 and INDV-6001.\nOperating loss as reported was $64m in YTD 2024 (YTD 2023 operating loss: $65m). The change on a reported\nbasis reflects higher NR and gross profit offset by increased operating expenses. (See \"Appendix\" for adjusted\nresults details of exceptional expenses included in operating profit).\nAfter excluding exceptional items and other adjustments of $309m and $267m in YTD 2024 and YTD 2023,\nrespectively, YTD 2024 adjusted operating profit increased 21% to $245m (YTD 2023: $202m). The increase\nprimarily reflects higher total NR partially offset by increased SG&A expenses, primarily due to increased sales and\nmarketing related to SUBLOCADE and the launch of OPVEE.\nQ3 2024 operating profit as reported was $4m (Q3 2023 operating loss: $183m). On an adjusted basis, Q3 2024\noperating profit increased 62% to $97m (adjusted Q3 2023: $60m), excluding exceptional costs and other\nadjustments of $93m (Q3 2023: $243m). The increase on an adjusted basis primarily reflects higher total NR and\nlower SG&A expenses.\nNet finance expense was $10m in YTD 2024 (YTD 2023: $4m income) reflecting a decrease in interest income on\nlower cash and investment balances. Q3 2024 net finance expense was $5m (Q3 2023: $2m income).\nReported tax benefit was $17m in YTD 2024 and the effective tax rate was 23% (YTD 2023 tax expense/rate: $9m,\n15%). YTD 2024 adjusted tax expense was $53m, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 23% (YTD 2023 adjusted\ntax expense/rate: $44m, 21%). The adjusted results exclude tax benefits on exceptional items and other\nadjustments. The movement in the effective tax rate on adjusted profits was impacted by an increase in the U.K.\ncorporation tax rate from 23.5% to 25%. The Q3 2024 reported tax benefit was $5m, and the effective tax rate was\nnot meaningful (Q3 2023: $46m, 25%). The tax expense on Q3 2024 adjusted profits was $20m, and the adjusted\neffective tax rate was 22%. The tax expense on Q3 2023 adjusted profits amounted to $13m, for a comparable\nadjusted effective tax rate of 21%.\nReported net loss in YTD 2024 was $57m and adjusted net income was $182m (YTD 2023 reported net loss: $52m,\nadjusted net income: $162m). The 12% increase in net income on an adjusted basis primarily reflected higher NR\npartly offset by an increase in operating expense. Q3 2024 net income on a reported basis was $4m (Q3 2023: net\nloss $135m), and net income of $72m on an adjusted basis excluding the net after-tax impact from exceptional\nitems and other adjustments (Adjusted Q3 2023: $49m). Higher Q3 2024 net income on an adjusted basis was\nprimarily due to an increase in NR.\nDiluted (losses) earnings per share were $(0.42) on a reported basis and $1.34 on an adjusted basis in YTD 2024\n(YTD 2023: $(0.38) diluted earnings per share and $1.14 adjusted diluted earnings per share). In Q3 2024, diluted\nlosses per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.03 and $0.54, respectively (Q3 2023: $(0.98)\nearnings per share on a diluted basis and $0.34 earnings per share adjusted diluted basis).\n4\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\nCash and investments totaled $344m at the end of Q3 2024, a decrease of $107m versus the $451m position at\nthe end of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the Group's litigation settlement payments of $158m and\nshare repurchases of $122m, partly offset by cash inflow from operating and investing activities.\nNet working capital, defined by management as inventory plus trade receivables, less trade and other payables,\nwas negative $386m on September 30, 2024, versus negative $347m at the end of FY 2023, reflecting increases in\nthe balance of accruals rebates, discounts and returns due to the timing of rebated invoicing.\nCash generated from operations in YTD 2024 was $94m (YTD 2023 cash used in operations: $2m), reflecting\nongoing operating performance partially offset by litigation payments of $158m. Net cash flow from operating\nactivities was $41m in YTD 2024 (YTD 2023 cash outflow: $34m) primarily reflecting cash generated from\noperations less tax payments.\nCash inflow from investing activities in YTD 2024 was $59m (YTD 2023 cash outflow: $104m) reflecting investment\nmaturities, partially offset by capital expenditures. In the prior year period, the outflow from investing activities\nprimarily reflected the Opiant acquisition, net of cash assumed.\nCash outflow from financing activities in YTD 2024 was $129m (YTD 2023 cash outflow: $25m) primarily reflecting\nshares repurchased and canceled. In the prior-year period, the outflow from financing activities primarily reflected\nshares repurchased and canceled and the extinguishment of debt assumed in the Opiant acquisition.\nPrincipal Risks Update\nThe principal risks facing the Group for the second half of 2024 are expected to be consistent with those disclosed\nin the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.\nExchange Rates\nThe average and period end exchange rates used for the translation of currencies into U.S. dollars that have the\nmost significant impacts on the Group’s results were:\n9 Months to September 30, 9 Months to September 30,\n2024 2023\nGB £ period end 1.3410 1.2125\nGB £ average rate 1.2765 1.2444\n€ Euro period end 1.1169 1.0503\n€ Euro average 1.0869 1.0835\nWebcast Details\nA live webcast presentation will be held on October 24, 2024, at 13:00 GMT (8:00 am EDT) hosted by Mark\nCrossley, CEO.

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nIndivior PLC (the 'Company') is a public limited company incorporated on September 26, 2014 and domiciled in the United\nKingdom. In these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (‘Condensed Financial Statements’),\nreference to the ‘Group’ means the Company and all its subsidiaries.\nThe Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.K. adopted International Accounting\nStandard 34, Interim Financial Reporting. The Condensed Financial Statements have been reviewed and are unaudited and\ndo not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements. Therefore, the Condensed\nFinancial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, which were prepared in accordance with U.K. adopted International Accounting Standards and in\nconformity with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. These Condensed\nFinancial Statements were approved for issue on October 23, 2024.\nIn preparing these Condensed Financial Statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the\nGroup’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for changes in estimates that are required\nin determining the provision for income taxes and resolution of uncertainties for certain contingent liabilities.\nIn 2023, the Group acquired an aseptic manufacturing facility which was accounted for as a business combination. As the\nacquisition was completed in late 2023, a provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of\nacquisition was disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. In Q1 2024,\nbased on new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, the Group\nadjusted the provisional fair values for acquired property, plant and equipment and the assumed onerous contract\nprovision, with an adjustment to goodwill equal to the change in the net assets acquired. These measurement period\nadjustments are reflected in the comparative period presented in the Condensed Financial Statements in accordance with\nIFRS 3 Business Combinations. The effect on depreciation and other changes in the related balances from the acquisition\ndate to December 31, 2023 was immaterial. Refer to Note 17 for a reconciliation of the previously reported provisional fair\nvalue of net assets acquired to the adjusted provisional fair value.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the functional currency of Indivior U.K. Limited, one of the Group’s significant subsidiaries,\nchanged from U.K. pound sterling to U.S. dollar (USD). This was the result of a change in the primary economic\nenvironment in which Indivior U.K. Limited operates, driven by growth of USD-denominated net revenue combined with an\nincrease in USD-denominated costs and culminating with a shift in investing activities. The Group determined the USD had\nbecome the dominant currency from January 2024.\nThe Directors have assessed the Group’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its operations, fulfill financial and\ncompliance obligations as set out in Note 11, and comply with the minimum liquidity covenant in the Group’s term loan for\nthe period to March 2026 (the going concern period). A base case model was produced reflecting:\n• Board reviewed financial plans for the period; and\n• settlement of liabilities and provisions in line with contractual terms.\nThe Directors also assessed a ‘severe but plausible’ downside scenario which included the following key changes to the\nbase case within the going concern period:\n• the risk that SUBLOCADE will not meet revenue growth expectations by modeling a 15% decline on forecasts;\n• an accelerated decline in U.S. SUBOXONE Film net revenue to generic analogues; and\n• a further decline in rest of world sublingual product net revenues.\nUnder both the base case and the downside scenario and acknowledging the Group's net liability position, sufficient\nliquidity exists and is generated from operations such that all business and covenant requirements are met for the going\nconcern period. Additionally, no material legal cases are expected to come to trial during the going concern period. As a\nresult of the analysis described above, the Directors reasonably expect the Group to have adequate resources to continue\nin operational existence for at least one year from the approval of these Condensed Financial Statements and therefore\nconsider the going concern basis to be appropriate for the accounting and preparation of these Condensed Financial\nStatements.\nThe financial information contained in this document does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 and\n435 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group’s statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, were\napproved by the Board of Directors on March 5, 2024 and were delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's\nreport on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any\nstatement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\n11\n2. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Group is engaged in a single business activity, which is predominantly the development, manufacture, and sale of\nbuprenorphine-based prescription drugs for treatment of opioid dependence and related disorders. The CEO reviews\ndisaggregated net revenue on a geographical and product basis and allocates resources on a functional basis between\nCommercial, Supply, Research and Development, and other Group functions. Financial results are reviewed on a\nconsolidated basis for evaluating financial performance and allocating resources. Accordingly, the Group operates in a\nsingle reportable segment.\nNet revenue\nRevenue is attributed geographically based on the country where the sale originates. The following table represents net\nrevenue by country:\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nUnited States 261 227 755 662\nRest of World 46 44 134 138\nTotal 307 271 889 800\nOn a disaggregated basis, the Group’s net revenue by major product line:\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nSUBLOCADE® 191 167 562 454\nOPVEE®1 15 — 15 —\nSublingual/other 93 93 281 316\nPERSERIS®2 8 11 31 30\nTotal 307 271 889 800\n1Net revenue for OPVEE® consists of two 100,000 unit product orders from the U.S. Biomedical Advancement Research and Development\nAuthority (BARDA).\n2 Marketing and promotion for PERSERIS® have been discontinued. Refer to Note 18.\nNon-current assets\nThe following table represents non-current assets, net of accumulated depreciation, amortization and impairment, by\ncountry. Non-current assets for this purpose consist of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use\nassets, investments, and other assets.\nDec 31, 2023\nSep 30, (Retrospectively\n2024 adjusted1)\n$m $m\nUnited States 203 209\nRest of World 158 209\nTotal 361 418\n1 The non-current asset balance in the United States as of December 31, 2023 was retrospectively adjusted in Q1 2024 to reflect\nmeasurement period adjustments of $2m to property, plant and equipment and $3m to intangible assets related to the November 2023\nacquisition of an aseptic manufacturing facility.

Expenses in the\n2023 periods include legal settlement costs and the acquisition of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Opiant\", refer to note 16).\n2 Depreciation and amortization expense represents amounts included in research and development and selling, general and\nadministrative expenses. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense in YTD 2024 of $30m (YTD 2023: $8m) and Q3 2024 of $3m\n(Q3 2023: $3m) for intangible assets, certain plant and equipment and right-of-use assets is included within cost of sales. YTD 2024\nincludes $17m related to the impairment of the Perseris marketed product intangible and plant and equipment (refer to Note 18).\n4.

TAXATION\nThe Group calculates tax expense for interim periods using the expected full year rates, considering the pre-tax income and\nstatutory rates for each jurisdiction. To the extent practicable, a separate estimated average annual effective income tax\nrate is determined for each taxing jurisdiction and applied individually to the interim period pre-tax income of each\njurisdiction. Similarly, if different income tax rates apply to different categories of income (such as capital gains or income\nearned in particular industries), to the extent practicable a separate rate is applied to each individual category of interim\nperiod pre-tax income. The resulting expense is allocated between current and deferred taxes based on actual movement\nin deferred tax for the quarter, with the balance recorded to the current tax accounts.\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nIncome tax benefit 5 46 17 9\nEffective tax rate (%) nm 25 % 23 % 15 %\n13\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate benefit is higher as the amount of disallowed\nexpenses are lower than in the prior year. The prior year included higher disallowed executive compensation relating to\nthe U.S. listing and certain litigation expenses.\nDec 31, 2023\nSep 30, (Retrospectively\n2024 adjusted1)\n$m $m\nCurrent tax receivable 20 —\nCurrent tax liabilities (9) (18)\nDeferred tax assets 304 267\n1 The deferred tax assets balance as of December 31, 2023 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect a measurement period adjustment\nrelated to the November 2023 acquisition of an aseptic manufacturing facility. Refer to Note 17.\nThe Group recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that sufficient future taxable profits are probable against which\nthese future tax deductions can be utilized. At September 30, 2024, the Group’s net deferred tax assets of $304m relate\nprimarily to net operating loss carryforwards, inventory costs capitalized for tax purposes, and litigation liabilities.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is reliant on forecast taxable profits arising in the jurisdiction in which the deferred tax\nasset is recognized. The Group has assessed recoverability of deferred tax assets using Group-level budgets and forecasts\nconsistent with those used for the assessment of viability and asset impairments, particularly in relation to levels of future\nnet revenues. These forecasts are subject to similar uncertainties to those assessments. This is reviewed each quarter and,\nto the extent required, an adjustment to the recognized deferred tax asset may be made. With the exception of specific\nassets that are not currently considered realizable, management have concluded full recognition of deferred tax assets to\nbe appropriate and do not believe a significant risk of material change in their assessment exists in the next 12 months\nfrom the balance sheet date.\nOther tax matters\nThe Group is subject to Pillar Two legislation effective January 1, 2024. As such, the Group performed an assessment of the\npotential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes including modeling of adjusted accounting data for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and a review of forecasts for the year ended December 31, 2024. Based on the assessment, the Group\ndid not record any current tax liability related to Pillar Two. The Group has applied the recent amendment to IAS 12 which\nprovides temporary relief to the recognition of deferred taxes relating to top-up income taxes.\nAs a multinational group, tax uncertainties remain in relation to Group financing, intercompany pricing, the location of\ntaxable operations, and certain non-recurring costs. Management have concluded tax provisions made to be appropriate\nand do not believe a significant risk of material change to uncertain tax positions exists in the next 12 months from the\nbalance sheet date. Including matters under audit, an estimate of reasonably possible additional tax liabilities and interest\nthat could arise in later periods on resolution of these uncertainties is in the range from nil to $58m.\n6. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe table below sets out basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for each period:\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $ $ $ $\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share $0.03 $(0.98) $(0.42) $(0.38)\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share $0.03 $(0.98) $(0.42) $(0.38)\nWeighted average number of shares\nThe weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (on a basic basis) for YTD 2024 includes the favorable impact\nof 8,407k ordinary shares repurchased in YTD 2024 and 1,413k ordinary shares repurchased from April to December 2023.\nSee Note 15 for further discussion.

As of September 30, 2024, expected credit losses\nfor the Group’s investments held at amortized cost are immaterial.\nFair value hierarchy\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability\nThe Group’s only financial instruments which are measured at fair value are equity securities at FVPL. The fair value of\nequity securities at FVPL is based on quoted market prices on the measurement date. The following table categorizes the\nGroup’s financial assets measured at fair value by valuation methodology used in determining their fair value:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAt September 30, 2024 $m $m $m $m\nEquity securities at FVPL 4 — — 4\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAt December 31, 2023 $m $m $m $m\nEquity securities at FVPL 10 — — 10\nThe decrease in equity securities at FVPL reflects the change in market price of Aelis Farma shares from the September\n2024 announcement that study results for their cannabis use disorder pipeline drug did not demonstrate the anticipated\nresults.\nThe Group also has certain financial instruments which are not measured at fair value. The carrying value of cash and cash\nequivalents, trade receivables, other assets, and trade and other payables is assumed to approximate fair value due to\ntheir short-term nature. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of investments held at amortized cost approximated\nthe fair value. The fair value of investments held at amortized cost was calculated based on quoted market prices which\nwould be classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy above.\n15\n9.

Long-term prepaid expenses primarily relate to payments for contract manufacturing capacity.\n10.

The key terms of\nthis loan in effect at September 30, 2024, are as follows:\nRequired\nannual Minimum\nCurrency Nominal interest margin Maturity repayments liquidity\nTerm loan facility USD SOFR + 0.11% + 5.25% 2026 1% Larger of $100m or 50% of loan balance\nThe term loan amounting to $242m (FY 2023: $244m) is secured against the assets of certain subsidiaries of the Group in\nthe form of guarantees issued by respective subsidiaries.\n• Nominal interest margin is monthly USD SOFR plus 0.11%, subject to a floor of 0.75%, plus a credit spread adjustment of\n5.25%.\n• There are no revolving credit commitments.\n11. PROVISIONS AND OTHER LIABILITIES\nProvisions\nTotal Total\nDec 31,\nNon- Sep 30, Non- 2023\nCurrent Current 2024 Current Current (Retro as dp je uc st tiv ee dl 1y )\nCurrent and non-current provisions $m $m $m $m $m $m\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims — — — (385) — (385)\nOther antitrust matters (20) (19) (39) — — —\nOpioid litigation (15) (63) (78) — — —\nOnerous contracts (13) — (13) (19) (3) (22)\nFalse claims allegations — — — (4) — (4)\nOther — (2) (2) — (2) (2)\nTotal provisions (48) (84) (132) (408) (5) (413)\n1 The provision for onerous contracts as of December 31, 2023 was retrospectively adjusted during the first quarter of 2024 to reflect a\nmeasurement period adjustment related to the November 2023 acquisition of an aseptic manufacturing facility. Refer to Note 17.\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims\nSettlement agreements were entered into during 2023 with three plaintiff classes to fully resolve certain multi-district\nantitrust claims. Indivior has no further obligations related to these matters.\n16\nOther antitrust matters\nThe provision of $39m at September 30, 2024 reflects the present value of the agreed amount in an expected settlement\nof the last remaining antitrust litigation with (i) Humana, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Humana”) and (ii)\nCentene Corporation, Wellcare Healthcare Plans, Inc., New York Quality Healthcare Corp. (d/b/a Fidelis Care), and Health\nNet, LLC (collectively, “Centene”). The $39m provision reflects the net present value (NPV) at the risk-free rate of the\nagreed amounts to be paid in 2024 and 2025. The parties to the settlement still must negotiate material terms and\nconditions of the final settlement agreement, which Indivior expects to resolve shortly (See Note 13). Final settlement, if\nreached, would resolve all of the Group’s remaining legacy antitrust litigation, including all claims in the Kentucky and\nPennsylvania state court actions filed by Humana, and all claims in the Virginia state court action filed by Centene.\nOpioid litigation\nThe provision of $78m at September 30, 2024 reflects the present value of the agreed amount in a preliminary settlement\nbetween Indivior, the plaintiffs' executive committee and certain state attorneys general covering certain opioid litigation\n(including cases in the Opioid MDL) brought by municipalities and tribes. The outflow of resources is expected to occur\nover five years. The parties still must negotiate material terms and conditions of the final settlement agreement, including\nstructure, and scope of releases. The provision is measured using a risk free rate and will be remeasured at a risk-adjusted\nrate upon reaching a final settlement agreement, at which time the Group expects to make a further disclosure. Refer to\nNote 13.\nOnerous contracts\nIn November 2023, the Group acquired a business consisting of a manufacturing facility, workforce, and supply contracts.\nThe facility is obligated to fulfill contracts that existed pre-acquisition for which the expected costs are in excess of the\nconsideration expected to be received. The Group recorded a provision for these onerous contracts in the allocation of\npurchase price, with a balance at the end of the quarter of $13m (FY 2023: $22m). During the quarter, net operating losses\nattributable to the contracts of $2m were recorded against the provision. Refer to Note 17. Manufacturing under the\nonerous contracts is expected to be completed during Q1 2025 and the provision is recorded at its discounted value, using\na market rate at the time of the transaction determined to be 7.6%.\nFalse Claims Act allegations\nDuring the quarter, the Group released a provision of $4m pertaining to an outstanding False Claims Act allegation\nconsidering an updated probability assessment at this early stage of litigation. No estimate of possible loss can be made at\nthis time. See Note 13.\nOther\nOther provisions of $2m (FY 2023: $2m) represent retirement benefit costs which are not expected to be settled within one\nyear.\nOther liabilities\nTotal Total\nNon- Sep 30, Non- Dec 31,\nCurrent Current 2024 Current Current 2023\nCurrent and non-current other liabilities $m $m $m $m $m $m\nDOJ resolution (52) (295) (347) (53) (344) (397)\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims — — — (30) — (30)\nOther antitrust matters — — — — — —\nIntellectual property related matters — — — (11) — (11)\nRB indemnity settlement (8) (7) (15) (8) (15) (23)\nShare repurchase (16) — (16) (23) — (23)\nOther — (13) (13) — (8) (8)\nTotal other liabilities (76) (315) (391) (125) (367) (492)\nDOJ Resolution Agreement\nIn July 2020, the Group settled criminal and civil liability with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), and U.S. state attorneys general. Pursuant to the resolution agreement, aggregate\npayments of $263m (including interest) have been made through September 30, 2024, including a payment of $53m in\nJanuary 2024. Annual installments of $50m plus interest are due every January 15 from 2025 to 2027, with the final\ninstallment of $200m due in December 2027. The Group has the option to prepay. Interest accrues at 1.25% on certain\nportions of the resolution and will be paid with the installment payments. For non-interest-bearing portions, the liability\nhas been recorded at the net present value based on timing of the estimated payments using a discount rate equal to the\n17\ninterest rate on the interest-bearing portions. In YTD 2024, the Group recorded interest expense totaling $3m (YTD 2023:\n$4m).\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims\nSettlement agreements were entered into during 2023 with three plaintiff classes to fully resolve certain multi-district\nantitrust claims. Indivior has no further obligations related to this matter.\nOther antitrust matters\nCertain antitrust cases filed in Virginia state court by Health Care Service Corp. (HCSC), Blue Cross Blue Shield of\nMassachusetts, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, Molina, and Aetna were settled and paid during the third quarter by\nagreement of the parties for $85m and mutual releases of claims and counterclaims. Refer to note 13.\nIP related matters\nOther liabilities for intellectual property related matters relate to the settlement of litigation with DRL in June 2022. Under\nthe settlement agreement, the Group made a final payment to DRL of $12m during Q1 2024 and has no further obligations\nrelated to this matter.\nRB indemnity settlement\nUnder the RB indemnity settlement, the Group has paid $34m of the $50m settlement agreement through September 30,\n2024 including $8m paid in January 2024. Remaining annual installment payments of $8m are due in January 2025 and\n2026. The Group carries a liability totaling $15m (FY 2023: $23m) related to this settlement. This liability has been recorded\nat the net present value, using a market interest rate at the time of the settlement determined to be 3.75%, considering\nthe timing of payments and other factors.\nShare repurchase\nIn August 2024, the Group commenced a share repurchase program of $100m. As of September 30, 2024, the liability of\n$16m represents the amount to be spent under the program through October 25, 2024, after which date the Company has\nthe ability to modify or terminate the program. As of December 31, 2023, the current liability of $23m represented the\namount to be spent under the previous share repurchase program through February 23, 2024.\nOther\nOther liabilities primarily represent employee related liabilities which are non-current as of September 30, 2024.\n12. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nThe Group has assessed certain legal and other matters to be not probable based upon current facts and circumstances,\nincluding any potential impact the DOJ resolution could have on these matters. Where liabilities related to these matters\nare determined to be possible, they represent contingent liabilities. Except for those matters discussed in Note 13 under\n“Civil Opioid Litigation” and \"Antitrust Litigation and Consumer Protection,\" for which a provision has been recognized,\nNote 13 sets out the details for legal and other disputes which the Group has assessed as contingent liabilities. Where the\nGroup believes it is possible to reasonably estimate a range for the contingent liability, this has been disclosed.\n13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nCertain ongoing legal proceedings or threats of legal proceedings to which the Group is a party, but in which the Group\nbelieves the possibility of an adverse impact is remote, are not discussed in this Note.\nAntitrust Litigation and Consumer Protection\n• Beginning in 2020, cases by (1) Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc., Blue Cross and Blue Shield of\nMassachusetts HMO Blue, Inc., (2) Health Care Service Corp., (3) Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, Inc., Health\nOptions, Inc., (4) BCBSM, Inc. (d/b/a Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota) and HMO Minnesota (d/b/a Blue Plus),\n(5) Molina Healthcare, Inc., and (6) Aetna Inc. were filed in the Circuit Court for the County of Roanoke, Virginia. See\nHealth Care Services Corp. v. Indivior Inc., No. CL20-1474 (Lead Case) (Va. Cir. Ct.) (Roanoke Cnty) (collectively, the\n\"HCSC Consolidated Litigation\"). In July 2023, Indivior Inc., BCBSM, Inc., and HMO Minnesota agreed to mutual\nreleases and settlement. The remaining plaintiffs asserted claims under federal and state RICO statutes, state antitrust\nstatutes, state statutes prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices, state statutes prohibiting insurance fraud, and\ncommon law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. On July 8, 2024, the parties reached an\nagreement to settle all remaining claims and counterclaims in the HCSC Consolidated Litigation for $85m.\n• The Group reached agreement on the amount of a potential settlement (\"Humana/Centene Settlement\") with\nHumana, Inc. and certain of its affiliated entities (collectively, the \"Humana Entities\") and Centene Corporation,\nWellcare Healthcare Plans, Inc., New York Healthcare Corp (d/b/a Fidels Care) and Healthnet, LLC (collectively, the\n\"Centene Entities\"). The Group has recorded a related provision of $39m, reflecting the net present value (NPV) of the\nagreed amount (See Note 11). The parties, however, still must negotiate material terms and conditions of the final\nsettlement agreement, including the structure and scope of the release.\n◦ As background, Humana, Inc. filed a complaint in state court in Kentucky on August 20, 2021 with claims\nsubstantially similar to those asserted by other end payors in the HCSC Consolidated Litigation. See Humana\nInc. v. Indivior Inc., No. 21-CI-004833 (Ky. Cir. Ct.) (Jefferson Cnty). The court lifted a stay on October 30,\n2023. Indivior moved to dismiss the complaint in February 2024. A hearing on Indivior's motion to dismiss\n18\nhas been set for December 9, 2024. This action would be dismissed if the Humana/Centene Settlement is\nfinalized.\n◦ As further background, the Centene Entities filed a complaint on January 13, 2023 in the Circuit Court for the\nCounty of Roanoke, Virginia alleging similar claims as in the HCSC Consolidated Litigation. See Centene Corp.\nv. Indivior Inc., No. CL23000054-00 (Va. Cir. Ct.) (Roanoke Cnty). This action would be dismissed if the\nHumana/Centene Settlement is finalized.\n◦ In 2013, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc., now known as Indivior Inc. received notice that it and other\ncompanies were defendants in a lawsuit initiated by writ in the Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) Court of\nCommon Pleas. See Carefirst of Maryland, Inc. et al. v. Reckitt Benckiser Inc., et al., Case. No. 2875,\nDecember Term 2013. The plaintiffs included approximately 79 entities, most of which appeared to be\ninsurance companies or other providers of health benefits plans. The claims of all plaintiffs in the Carefirst\naction except the Humana Entities were resolved in connection with final approval of the end payor\nsettlement in the Antitrust MDL, and accordingly dismissed on February 14, 2024. The claims of the Humana\nEntities in the Carefirst action remain pending, but would be dismissed if the Humana/Centene Settlement is\nfinalized.\n• As previously disclosed in 2023, Indivior Inc. settled claims of all plaintiff groups in the company's antitrust multi-\ndistrict litigation (\"Antitrust MDL\") namely, (i) 41 states and the District of Columbia (the \"States\"), (ii) end payors, and\n(iii) direct purchasers (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\"). Indivior Inc. reached a settlement with the States for $103m on\nJune 1, 2023. Indivior Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the end payor class for $30m on August 14, 2023\nand received final court approval on December 5, 2023. On October 22, 2023, Indivior Inc. entered into a settlement\nagreement with the remaining direct purchaser class for $385m, which received final court approval on February 27,\n2024.\nCivil Opioid Litigation\n• The Group has been named as a defendant in more than 400 civil lawsuits alleging that manufacturers, distributors,\nand retailers of opioids engaged in a longstanding practice to market opioids as safe and effective for the treatment of\nlong-term chronic pain to increase the market for opioids and their own market shares for opioids, or alleging\nindividual personal injury claims. Most of these cases have been consolidated and are pending in a federal multi-\ndistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. See In re National Prescription Opiate\nLitigation, MDL No. 2804 (N.D. Ohio) (the \"Opioid MDL\"). Nearly two-thirds of the cases in the Opioid MDL were filed\nby cities and counties, while nearly one-third of the cases were filed by individual plaintiffs, most of whom assert\nclaims relating to neonatal abstinence syndrome (\"NAS\"). Litigation against the Group in the Opioid MDL is stayed.\n• Pursuant to mediation, the Group, the Plaintiffs' Executive Committee in the Opioid MDL, Tribal Leadership\nCommittee, and certain state attorneys general reached agreement on the amount of a potential settlement. The\nGroup has recorded a related provision of $78m, reflecting the net present value (NPV) of the agreed amount (See\nNote 11). The parties, however, still must negotiate material terms and conditions of the final settlement agreement,\nincluding the structure and scope of the release. The proposed settlement does not include private plaintiffs.\n• Separately, Indivior Inc. was named as one of numerous defendants in civil opioid cases that are not part of the Opioid\nMDL:\n◦ Indivior was named as one of numerous defendants in various other federal and state court cases that are not in\nthe Opioid MDL and were brought by municipalities. These cases include, for example, 35 actions filed in New\nYork state court that were removed to federal court, as well as cases filed in federal district courts sitting in\nAlabama, Florida, Georgia, and New Mexico. On motion of the plaintiffs, the New York cases were remanded\nback to state court. The plaintiffs in the case filed in the Northern District of Alabama voluntarily dismissed their\ncomplaint, subject to certain tolling agreements. The various other federal actions currently are stayed, except\nIndivior moved to dismiss the complaint in San Miguel Hospital Corp. d/b/a Alta Vista Regional Medical Center v.\nJohnson & Johnson, et al., No. 1:23-cv-00903 (D.N.M.) in May 2024. Indivior's motion to dismiss remains pending.\n◦ Indivior Inc. was named as a defendant in five individual complaints filed in West Virginia state court that were\ntransferred to West Virginia's Mass Litigation Panel. See In re Opioid Litigation, No. 22-C-9000 NAS (W.V.\nKanawha Cnty. Cir. Ct.) (\"WV MLP Action\"). All five of Indivior Inc.'s cases in the WV MLP Action involve claims\nrelated to NAS. Indivior Inc. moved to dismiss all five complaints on January 30, 2023. By order dated April 17,\n2023, the court granted Indivior's motions to dismiss. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on June 30, 2023, and\nthe appellate court heard oral argument on September 17, 2024. The appellate court has not yet ruled on the\nappeal.\n• Additionally, on May 23, 2024, the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland\nserved on Indivior Inc. an administrative subpoena related generally to opioid products marketed and sold in\nMaryland. Indivior Inc.’s response to the subpoena remains ongoing.\n• The Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously\ndefend itself in the private plaintiff actions. Given the status and preliminary stage of litigation in the separate federal\nand state court actions for the private plaintiff cases, no estimate of possible loss in the opioid litigation for the private\nplaintiffs can be made at this time.\n19\nFalse Claims Act Allegations\n• In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia unsealed a declined qui tam\ncomplaint alleging causes of action under the Federal and state False Claims Acts against certain entities within the\nGroup predicated on best price issues and claims of retaliation. See United States ex rel. Miller v. Reckitt Benckiser\nGroup PLC et al., Case No. 1:15-cv-00017 (W.D. Va.). The suit also seeks reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The\nGroup filed a Motion to Dismiss in June 2021, which was granted in part and denied in part on October 17, 2023. The\nrelator filed a sixth amended complaint against only Indivior Inc. on December 7, 2023. Indivior answered the sixth\namended complaint on March 18, 2024. Discovery is ongoing. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation,\nno estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\n• In May 2018, Indivior Inc. received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office (“USAO”) for the\nSouthern District of New York, seeking records relating to the SUBOXONE Film manufacturing process. The Group\nprovided the USAO certain information regarding allegations that the government received regarding SUBOXONE\nFilm. There has been no communication regarding this matter with the USAO since 2022.\nU.K. Shareholder Claims\n• On September 21, 2022, certain shareholders issued representative and multiparty claims against Indivior PLC in the\nHigh Court of Justice for the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, King’s Bench Division. On January 16,\n2023, the representative served its Particular of Claims setting forth in more detail the claims against the Group, while\nthe same law firm that represents the representative also sent its draft Particular of Claims for the multiparty action.\nThe claims made in both the representative and multiparty actions generally allege that Indivior PLC violated the U.K.\nFinancial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA 2000”) by making false or misleading statements or material\nomissions in public disclosures, including the 2014 Demerger Prospectus, regarding an alleged product-hopping\nscheme regarding the switch from SUBOXONE Tablets to SUBOXONE Film. Indivior PLC filed an application to strike\nout the representative action. On December 5, 2023, the court handed down a judgment allowing the Group's\napplication to strike out the representative action. The court subsequently awarded certain costs to the Group. On\nJanuary 23, 2024, the claimants requested permission to appeal the decision to the court of appeals. The appellate\ncourt has indicated that it will hear the appeal between December 10 and 12, 2024. The Group has begun its\nevaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status\nand preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\nU.S. Shareholder Claims\n• A class action lawsuit was filed against Indivior PLC, Mark Crossley (the CEO of the Group), and Ryan Preblick (the CFO\nof the Group) on August 2, 2024, alleging violations of certain United States federal securities laws. The putative class,\nas alleged, includes plaintiffs that purchased or otherwise acquired Indivior securities between February 22, 2024 and\nJuly 8, 2024. The court entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff on October 7, 2024. The lead plaintiff must file an\namended complaint on or before December 5, 2024, and the defendants must respond by January 10, 2025. Given the\nstatus and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\nOpiant Shareholder Claims\n• On November 8, 2023, plaintiff James Litten filed a class action complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging\nthat former officers and directors of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Opiant\") breached fiduciary duties of care, loyalty,\nand good faith in connection with Indivior PLC's 2022 acquisition of Opiant. The defendants moved to dismiss the\ncomplaint on January 26, 2024. On March 21, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which added Lazard\nFreres & Co. LLC, which was Opiant's advisor in the acquisition as a defendant. The defendants moved to dismiss the\namended complaint on June 21, 2024. The motion to dismiss remains pending. The Group has begun its evaluation of\nthe claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status and\npreliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\nDental Allegations\n• The Group has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging that Suboxone® Film was defectively\ndesigned and caused dental injury, and that the Group failed to properly warn of the risks of such injuries. The\nplaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages, as well as punitive damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. Plaintiffs\nand potential plaintiffs related to these lawsuits generally can be grouped as follows:\n▪ Dental MDL Plaintiffs: More than 675 of these cases have been consolidated in multi-district litigation in the\nNorthern District of Ohio. See In Re Suboxone (Buprenorphine/Naloxone) Film Products Liability Litigation,\nMDL No. 3092 (N.D. Oh.) (the \"Dental MDL\").\n▪ Dental MDL Schedule A Plaintiffs: One complaint filed in the Dental MDL on June 14, 2024 attached a\nschedule of nearly 10,000 plaintiffs (the “Schedule A Plaintiffs”). The parties are in the process of negotiating\na tolling agreement for the Schedule A Plaintiffs that would permit plaintiffs’ counsel additional time to\ninvestigate issues such as whether and when the Schedule A Plaintiffs used any Indivior product before\ndetermining whether to file individual complaints that ultimately would be coordinated with the Dental\nMDL. Plaintiffs indicated to the court they will dismiss more than 1,400 plaintiffs in the future, pursuant to a\nmechanism to be provided by the court.\n▪ State Court Plaintiffs: One complaint has been filed in New Jersey state court, and the parties have agreed to\ntoll the claims of more than 850 other individuals in Delaware, New Jersey, and Virginia. Complaints have\nnot yet been filed on behalf of the tolled individuals.\n20\n• Product liability cases such as these typically involve issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance\non those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual/provable injury and other matters. These cases are in their\npreliminary stages. These lawsuits and claims follow a June 2022 required revision to the Prescribing Information and\nPatient Medication Guide about dental problems reported in connection with buprenorphine medicines dissolved in\nthe mouth to treat opioid use disorder. This revision was required by the FDA of all manufacturers of these products.\nThe Group has been informed by its primary insurance carrier that defense costs for the Dental MDL should begin to\nbe reimbursed now that the Group's self-insurance retention has been exhausted. Additionally, the Group's primary\ninsurance carrier has issued a reservation of rights against payment of any liability costs. In the event of a liability\nfinding, various factors could affect reimbursement or payment by insurers, if any, including (i) the scope of the\ninsurers’ purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage, (ii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, (iii)\ndelays in or avoidance of payment by insurers and (iv) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the\nfuture. The Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to\nvigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be\nmade at this time.\n• Applications to file class actions based on similar allegations as in the Dental MDL were filed in Quebec and British\nColumbia against various subsidiaries of the Group, among other defendants, in April 2024. The Group has begun its\nevaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status\nand preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\n14.

In YTD 2024, net settlement of tax on employee equity awards was $20m (YTD 2023:\n$22m).\nShares repurchased and canceled\nOn November 17, 2023, the Group commenced a share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price up to no more\nthan $100m or 13,632k of ordinary shares which concluded on August 2, 2024. During the period, the Group repurchased\nand canceled a total of 4,532k of ordinary shares at $0.50 per share under this program.\n21\nOn August 5, 2024, the Group commenced a share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of no more than\n$100m or 13,649k of ordinary shares and ending no later than January 31, 2025. During the period, the Group repurchased\nand canceled a total of 3,875k of ordinary shares at $0.50 per share under this program.\nThe aggregate nominal value of shares repurchased during 2024 under the November 2023 and August 2024 programs was\n$4m.\nAll ordinary shares repurchased during the period under share repurchase programs were canceled resulting in a transfer\nof the aggregate nominal value to a capital redemption reserve. The total cost of the purchases made under the share\nrepurchase program during the period, including directly attributable transaction costs, was $122m (YTD 2023: $11m). A\nnet repurchase amount of $16m has been recorded as a financial liability and reduction of retained earnings which\nrepresents the amount to be spent under the program through October 24, 2024, after which date the Company has the\nability to modify or terminate the program. Total purchases under the share repurchase program will be made out of\ndistributable profits.\n16. ACQUISITION OF OPIANT\nOn March 2, 2023, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opiant for upfront cash consideration of $146m and an\nadditional maximum amount of $8.00 per share in Contingent Value Rights (CVR) to be potentially paid upon achievement\nof net sales milestones. As a result of the acquisition, the Group added OPVEE (nalmefene nasal spray), an opioid overdose\ntreatment well-suited to confront illicit synthetic opioids like fentanyl, to its addiction science portfolio. OPVEE was\napproved by the FDA in May 2023 and launched in October 2023.\nSince substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in the OPVEE in-process research and\ndevelopment, the Group accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded an intangible asset of $126m.\nThe cash outflow for the acquisition was $124m in Q1 2023, net of cash acquired, and inclusive of direct transaction costs.\nAs part of the acquisition, the Group assumed outstanding debt of $10m which was settled and included as a cash outflow\nfrom financing activities.\nAdditional acquisition-related costs of $16m were incurred in 2023 and included in selling, general, and administrative\nexpenses, primarily relating to severance, acceleration of vesting of Opiant employee share compensation, and short-term\nretention accruals.\n17. BUSINESS COMBINATION\nOn November 1, 2023, the Group acquired an aseptic manufacturing facility (the \"Facility\") in the United States for upfront\nconsideration of $5m in cash and assumption of certain contract manufacturing obligations. The Facility will be further\ndeveloped to secure the long-term production and supply of SUBLOCADE.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance\nwith IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value, with the excess\nof the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognized as goodwill. An onerous\ncontract provision was recorded at fair value to reflect the present value of the expected losses from assumed contractual\nmanufacturing obligations. Net operating losses attributable to these contractual obligations will be recorded against the\nonerous contract provision from the date of acquisition through fulfillment of the contracts in early 2025.\nAs of September 30, 2024, committed capital spend for the Facility is approximately $22m.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nAs the acquisition was completed in late 2023, the provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the\ndate of acquisition was disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. During\nQ1 2024, based on new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, the\nGroup adjusted the provisional fair values for acquired property, plant and equipment and the assumed onerous contract\nprovision, with an adjustment to goodwill equal to the change in the net assets acquired. These measurement period\nadjustments were reflected in the comparative period presented in the Condensed Financial Statements in accordance\nwith IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The following table provides a reconciliation from the provisional fair values of assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition as reported in the 2023 annual financial statements to the\nprovisional fair values as adjusted during Q1 2024:\nProvisional values\nMeasurement\nAs Previously period\nReported adjustment As adjusted\nNet assets acquired $m $m $m\nProperty, plant and equipment 28 (2) 26\nDeferred tax assets 2 (1) 1\nTrade and other payables (1) — (1)\nProvisions (29) 6 (23)\nTotal net assets acquired — 3 3\n22\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognized as follows, reflecting the Q1 2024 measurement period\nadjustments:\nProvisional values\nMeasurement\nAs Previously period\nReported adjustment As adjusted\n$m $m $m\nConsideration transferred 5 — 5\nLess: Fair value of net assets acquired — (3) (3)\nGoodwill 5 (3) 2\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to Indivior-specific synergies relating to accelerated in-sourcing of SUBLOCADE\nproduction and the skills and technical talent of the Facility's workforce.\n18. DISCONTINUATION OF PERSERIS SALES & MARKETING\nAs announced in July 2024, the Group discontinued promotion and marketing support for PERSERIS, resulting in a\nheadcount reduction of approximately 130 employees and termination of related contract manufacturing agreements. The\ndecision was taken in consideration of regulatory changes announced during Q2 2024 which are expected to adversely\nintensify payor management of the treatment category in which PERSERIS competes and would make PERSERIS no longer\nfinancially viable. While the Group will continue to supply PERSERIS for the foreseeable future, the expected adverse\nimpacts represented an impairment indicator for PERSERIS-related assets, resulting in year to date impairment charges and\nother expenses as detailed below. Charges of $42m recorded in Q2 included inventory provisions and impairment of\ntangible and intangible assets. Charges of $21m recorded in Q3 included contract termination costs and severance.\nQ3 2024 YTD 2024\nImpairment charges, write downs and other charges $m $m\nCharged to cost of goods sold\nMarketed product intangible — 9\nPlant and equipment — 8\nInventory (2) 22\nContract termination fees 12 12\nSub-total: Cost of goods sold 10 51\nCharged to SG&A:\nSeverance 7 7\nOther expenses 4 5\nSub-total: SG&A 11 12\nTotal charges 21 63\n19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nCT-102 Digital Therapeutic Product\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, as part of strategic streamlining actions, the Group discontinued its collaboration\nagreement for the development and commercialization of the prescription digital therapeutic product, CT-102. As a result,\ncontract termination fees of approximately $7m and a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $8m will be incurred\nin Q4 2024.\n23\nDIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT\nThe Directors declare that, to the best of their knowledge, this set of condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements, which have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34,\nInterim Financial Reporting, gives a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or\nloss of Indivior.\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the\nUnited Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from\nlegislation in other jurisdictions.\nDetails of Indivior PLC’s Directors are available on our website at www.indivior.com.\nBy order of the Board\nMark Crossley Ryan Preblick\nChief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer\nOctober 23, 2024\n24\nIndependent review report to Indivior PLC\nReport on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements\nOur conclusion\nWe have reviewed Indivior PLC’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim financial\nstatements”) in the Q3 and YTD 2024 Financial Results of Indivior PLC for the three and nine month periods ended\n30 September 2024.\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial\nstatements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting\nStandard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'.\nThe interim financial statements comprise:\n• the Condensed consolidated interim balance sheet as at 30 September 2024;\n• the Condensed consolidated interim income statement and Condensed consolidated interim statement of\ncomprehensive income for the three and nine month periods then ended;\n• the Condensed consolidated interim cash flow statement for the nine month period then ended;\n• the Condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity for the nine month period then ended;\nand\n• the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.\nThe interim financial statements included in the Q3 and YTD 2024 Financial Results of Indivior PLC have been\nprepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'.\nBasis for conclusion\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410, ‘Review of\nInterim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Financial Reporting\nCouncil for use in the United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK) 2410”). A review of interim financial information consists of\nmaking enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and\nother review procedures.\nA review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on\nAuditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all\nsignificant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nWe have read the other information contained in the Q3 and YTD 2024 Financial Results and considered whether it\ncontains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial\nstatements.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis\nfor conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have\ninappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material\nuncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review\nprocedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may cause the\ngroup to cease to continue as a going concern.\nResponsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review\nOur responsibilities and those of the directors\nThe Q3 and YTD 2024 Financial Results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has\nbeen approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the Q3 and YTD 2024 Financial Results in\naccordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial\nConduct Authority. In preparing the Q3 and YTD 2024 Financial Results, including the interim financial statements,\nthe directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as\napplicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors\neither intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n25\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the Q3 and YTD 2024 Financial\nResults based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions relating to going concern, is based on\nprocedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this\nreport. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of\ncomplying with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial\nConduct Authority and for no other purpose.

Exceptional items and other\nadjustments are excluded from adjusted results consistent with the internal reporting provided to management and the\nDirectors. Examples of such items could include income or restructuring and related expenses from the reconfiguration of\nthe Group’s activities and/or capital structure, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of current and non-\ncurrent assets, gains and losses from the sale of intangible assets, certain costs arising as a result of significant and non-\nrecurring regulatory and litigation matters, and certain tax related matters.\nAdjusted results are not measures defined by IFRS and are not a substitute for, or superior to, reported results presented in\naccordance with IFRS. Adjusted results as presented by the Group are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies. As a result, these performance measures should not be considered in isolation from,\nor as a substitute analysis for, the Group's reported results presented in accordance with IFRS. Management performs a\nquantitative and qualitative assessment to determine if an item should be considered for adjustment. The table below sets\nout exceptional items and other adjustments recorded in each period:\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nExceptional items and other adjustments within cost of sales\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets1 (3) (3) (9) (5)\nDiscontinuation of sales and marketing for PERSERIS2 (10) — (51) —\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments within cost of sales (13) (3) (60) (5)\nExceptional items and other adjustments within SG&A\nLegal costs/provisions3 (36) (240) (196) (240)\nDiscontinuation of sales and marketing for PERSERIS2 (11) — (12) —\nImpairment of products in development4 (28) — (28) —\nAcquisition-related costs6 — — (4) (16)\nU.S. listing costs7 — — (4) (6)\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments within SG&A (75) (240) (244) (262)\nExceptional items within other (losses)/gains, net\nMark-to-market on equity investments5 (5) — (5) —\nTotal exceptional items within other (losses)/gains, net (5) — (5) —\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments before taxes (93) (243) (309) (267)\nTax on exceptional items and other adjustments 25 59 70 61\nExceptional tax items8 — — — (8)\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments (68) (184) (239) (214)\n1. The Group reported adjusted cost of sales to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n2. In Q3 2024 and YTD 2024 the Group recognized $21m and $63m of exceptional costs related to the discontinuation of sales and marketing for\nPERSERIS, including contractual fees, impairment of assets, inventory provisions and severance.\n3. In Q3 2024, the Group recognized exceptional costs of $39m related to the expected settlement of certain antitrust legal matters. YTD 2024\nalso includes $85m related to the July 8, 2024 settlement of certain antitrust legal matters and $75m related to the Opioid MDL (refer to\nNotes 11 and 13).\n4. In Q3 2024, the Group impaired a product in development resulting from a clinical study that did not demonstrate the anticipated results.\n5. In Q3 2024, a mark-to-market adjustment was recorded related to the impact on the quoted market price of the ordinary shares of Aelis\nFarma of the announcement that the clinical Phase 2B study with AEF0117 in participants with cannabis use disorder did not demonstrate the\nanticipated results.\n6. In YTD 2024, the Group recognized $4m of exceptional costs related to the acquisition and integration of the aseptic manufacturing site\nacquired in November 2023 (refer to note 17). In YTD 2023, the Group recognized $16m of exceptional costs related to the acquisition of\nOpiant (refer to Note 16).\n7. The Group recognized exceptional costs related to listing Indivior shares on NASDAQ as the primary listing of $4m in YTD 2024 and $2m in Q3\n2024 (YTD 2023: $6m).\n8. Exceptional tax items in YTD 2023 are comprised of $5m write off of deferred tax assets and tax expense due to limitation on the deduction of\nexecutive compensation by U.S. publicly traded companies and $3m change in estimate as to the tax benefit of legal provisions booked in the\nprior year.\n27\nAdjusted results\nManagement provides certain adjusted financial measures which may be useful to investors. These adjusted financial\nmeasures exclude items which do not reflect the Group's day-to-day operations and therefore may help with comparisons\nto prior periods or among companies. Management may use these financial measures to better understand trends in the\nbusiness.\nThe tables below present the adjustments between reported and adjusted results for both Q3/YTD 2024 and Q3/YTD 2023.\nReconciliation of gross profit to adjusted gross profit\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nGross profit 238 225 681 665\nExceptional items and other adjustments in cost of sales 13 3 60 5\nAdjusted gross profit 251 228 741 670\nWe define adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit divided by net revenue.\nReconciliation of selling, general and administrative expenses to adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (208) (390) (665) (654)\nExceptional items and other adjustments in selling, general and 75 240 244 262\nadministrative expenses\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (133) (150) (421) (392)\nReconciliation of operating profit/(loss) to adjusted operating profit\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nOperating profit/(loss) 4 (183) (64) (65)\nExceptional items and other adjustments in cost of sales 13 3 60 5\nExceptional items and other adjustments in selling, general and 75 240 244 262\nadministrative expenses\nExceptional items and other adjustments in net other operating income 5 — 5 —\nAdjusted operating profit 97 60 245 202\nWe define adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating profit divided by net revenue.\nReconciliation of loss before taxation to adjusted profit before taxation\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nLoss before taxation (1) (181) (74) (61)\nExceptional items and other adjustments in cost of sales 13 3 60 5\nExceptional items and other adjustments in selling, general and 75 240 244 262\nadministrative expenses\nExceptional items and other adjustments in net other operating income 5 — 5 —\nAdjusted profit before taxation 92 62 235 206\nReconciliation of tax expense to adjusted tax expense\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nTax benefit/(expense) 5 46 17 9\nTax on exceptional items and other adjustments (25) (59) (70) (61)\nExceptional tax items — — — 8\nAdjusted tax (expense) (20) (13) (53) (44)\nWe define adjusted effective tax rate as adjusted tax expense divided by adjusted profit before taxation.\n28\nReconciliation of net loss to adjusted net income\nQ3 Q3 YTD YTD\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30 $m $m $m $m\nNet income/(loss) 4 (135) (57) (52)\nExceptional items and other adjustments in cost of sales 13 3 60 5\nExceptional items and other adjustments in selling, general and 75 240 244 262\nadministrative expenses\nExceptional items and other adjustments in net other operating income 5 — 5 —\nTax on exceptional items and other adjustments (25) (59) (70) (61)\nExceptional tax items — — — 8\nAdjusted net income 72 49 182 162\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\nManagement believes that diluted earnings per share, adjusted for the impact of exceptional items and other adjustments\nafter the appropriate tax amount, may provide meaningful information on underlying trends to shareholders in respect of\nearnings per ordinary share.

The underlying demand for this transformative\ntreatment for moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder (OUD) remains strong in a market that continues to be\nheavily under-treated. As previously announced, SUBLOCADE’s Q2 growth was adversely impacted by transitory\nitems, including Medicaid patient disenrollment dynamics, lower channel stocking and longer sales lead times for\nnew criminal justice system accounts. We incorporated these items into our FY 2024 guidance that we updated\nearlier this month. We remain confident that we will deliver on our objectives for SUBLOCADE, which include\nachieving a NR run rate of $1 billion as we exit 2025 and peak annual NR of greater than $1.5 billion.\nSeparately, we took the difficult decision earlier this month to end sales and marketing of PERSERIS® due to\nimpending market changes that would make the product no longer financially viable.\nWhile 2024 has proved to be a more challenging year than we had anticipated, we remain highly confident in the\nunderlying fundamentals of our business and strategy, and that we are on a clear path to create substantial\nshareholder value. Reflecting our confidence, we are today announcing a new $100m share repurchase program\nwhich we intend to execute over an accelerated time frame.\"\nExpected Settlement of Opioid Litigation\nIndivior continues to address legacy litigation to create greater certainty for all stakeholders. Today, the Group\nannounces an expected settlement related to opioid litigation, including certain parties in the opioid multi-district\nlitigation (MDL). The Group has recorded a related provision of $75m, reflecting the net present value (NPV) at the\nrisk-free rate of the agreed amount with the plaintiffs' executive committee and certain state attorneys general,\nexpected to be paid over a five-year period. The parties to the settlement still must negotiate material terms and\nconditions of the final settlement agreement, which Indivior expects to resolve in due course. Upon final\nsettlement, the provision will be reclassified to a liability and the NPV will be remeasured using a risk-adjusted rate\nand likely adjusted down to approximately $65m, reflecting the Group’s cost of debt versus the risk-free rate used\nto record the provision (See Notes 11 and 13).\nPeriod to June 30th Q2 Q2 % H1 H1 %\n(Unaudited) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\n$m $m $m $m\nNet Revenue 299 276 8% 583 529 10%\nOperating (Loss) / Profit (132) 61 NM (67) 118 NM\nNet (Loss)/Income (107) 39 NM (60) 83 NM\nDiluted EPS ($) $(0.79) $0.27 NM $(0.44) $0.59 NM\nAdjusted Basis\nAdj.

H1 2024 adjusted operating profit of $149m increased 5%\n(Adjusted H1 2023: $142m). Q2 2024 adjusted operating profit of $79m increased 11% (Adjusted Q2 2023:\n$71m).\n• H1 2024 reported net loss was $60m (H1 2023 net income: $83m); Q2 2024 reported net loss was $107m (Q2\n2023 net income: $39m). H1 2024 adjusted net income was $111m (Adjusted H1 2023: $112m). Q2 2024\nadjusted net income of $60m increased 7% (Adjusted Q2 2023: $56m).\n• Cash and investments totaled $405m at the end of H1 2024 (including $26m restricted for self-insurance) (FY\n2023: $451m). The decrease was primarily due to the Group's litigation settlement payments of $70m and\nshare repurchases of $70m, partly offset by cash inflow from operating activities.\nH1/ Q2 2024 Product Highlights\n• SUBLOCADE: H1 2024 NR of $371m (+29% vs. H1 2023); Q2 2024 NR of $192m (+24% vs. Q2 2023 and +7% vs.\nQ1 2024). Continued growth primarily reflects further organized health system (OHS) and justice system\nchannel penetration in the U.S. resulting in increased new U.S. patient enrollments. Q2 2024 U.S. units\ndispensed were approx. 155,700 (+25% vs. Q2 2023 and +5% vs. Q1 2024). Total U.S. patients on a 12-month\nrolling basis at the end of Q2 2024 were approximately 160,400 (+49% vs. Q2 2023 and +7% vs. Q1 2024).\n• OPVEE® (nalmefene) nasal spray: Q2 2024 NR was modest (under $1m); near-term launch focus is on\nsupporting policy changes to enable nalmefene opioid rescue treatments, increasing product trial among\ntargeted users and readying supply for the U.S. Biomedical Advancement Research and Development\nAuthority (BARDA).\n• PERSERIS (risperidone) extended release injection: H1 2024 NR of $23m (+21% vs. H1 2023); Q2 2024 NR of\n$13m (+18% vs. Q2 2023 and +18% vs. Q1 2024). As previously announced, sales and marketing of PERSERIS\nhave been discontinued.\n• SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine/naloxone) Film: U.S. share in Q2 2024 averaged 16% (Q2 2023: 19%).\nFY 2024 Guidance\nOn July 9th, the Group updated its financial guidance for FY 2024 to reflect continued near-term adverse market\ndynamics impacting SUBLOCADE NR growth as well as the initial commercial adoption of OPVEE and the cessation\nof PERSERIS sales and marketing. The guidance set out is unchanged from the July 9th guidance. At the midpoint,\nthe Group expects solid adjusted operating profit growth of 12% and adjusted operating margin expansion of\napproximately 100 basis points.\nGuidance assumes no material change in exchange rates for key currencies compared with FY 2023 average rates,\nnotably USD/GBP and USD/EUR.\nFY 2024\nNet Revenue (NR) $1,150m to $1,215m\n(+8% at midpoint vs. FY 2023)\nSUBLOCADE NR $765m to $805m\n(+25% at midpoint vs. FY 2023)\nOPVEE NR $9m to $14m1\nPERSERIS NR $27m to $33m\nSUBOXONE Film Market Share Assumes historic rate of share decline in FY 2024 of 1\nto 2 percentage points and the potential impact from\na fourth buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film\ngeneric in the U.S. market\nAdjusted Gross Margin Low to mid-80s % range\nAdjusted SG&A ($550m) to ($560m)\nR&D ($120m) to ($130m)\nAdjusted Operating Profit $285m to $320m\n(+12% at midpoint vs. FY 2023)\n1 OPVEE NR guidance for FY 2024 includes approximately $8m as part of a multi-year agreement with the U.S. Biomedical Advancement\nResearch and Development Authority (BARDA).\n2\nPrimary U.S. Listing Complete\nOn June 27th 2024, Indivior transitioned its primary listing to the U.S. from the U.K. with the transfer of the\nGroup’s listing category on the Official List of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) from “Premium Listing\n(commercial company)” to “Standard Listing (shares).” The Group believes a primary U.S. listing is beneficial to\nIndivior stakeholders because it is better aligned with its current and future growth opportunities, is expected to\nattract more U.S. investors and analysts, permits inclusion in U.S. indices over time and reflects the growing\nproportion of its share capital owned by U.S. based investors. The Board intends to maintain Indivior's U.K. listing\nas a secondary listing.\nOn July 11th, 2024, the FCA published its policy statement PS24/6 (“Primary Markets Effectiveness Review:\nFeedback to CP23/31 and final UK Listing Rules\") setting out a series of final reforms to the FCA’s Listing Rules to\ntake effect on July 29th, 2024, including the removal of the current “Premium” and “Standard” listing categories\nand the introduction of new listing categories in their place. Pursuant to these reforms, as an English-incorporated\ncompany with an existing “Standard” listing, Indivior expects that it will be mapped to the new “Equity Shares\n(Transition)” category on July 29th, 2024. Indivior’s inclusion in the new “Equity Shares (Transition)” category will\nnot impact the location of Indivior’s primary listing in the U.S. and Indivior expects that the overall burden of\ncompliance for it under the new “Equity Shares (Transition)” category will be substantially equivalent to that of the\ncurrent “Standard Listing (shares)” category.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nOn November 17th, 2023, Indivior announced a share repurchase program of up to $100m. Through July 12, 2024,\nthe Group repurchased and canceled 5,499,528 Indivior ordinary shares, equivalent to approximately 4% of diluted\nshares outstanding, at a daily weighted average purchase price of 1,357p. The cost was approximately $95m, which\nincludes directly attributable transaction costs. The Group now expects to conclude this program by the end of July\n(see today's separate announcement and Note 15).\nThe Group also announces today that the Board has approved a new non-discretionary $100m share repurchase\nprogram that is expected to commence immediately upon the conclusion of the Group's current $100m share\nrepurchase program. This new program will be executed over an accelerated time frame (see today's separate\nannouncement for more details).\nU.S. OUD Market Update\nIn Q2 2024, U.S. buprenorphine medication-assisted treatments (BMAT) grew in mid-single digits in volume terms.\nThe Group continues to expect long-term U.S. growth to be sustained in the mid- to high-single digit percentage\nrange due to increased overall public awareness of the opioid epidemic and approved treatments, together with\nregulatory and legislative actions, such as the late 2022 enactment of the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act,\nthat have expanded OUD treatment funding and treatment capacity. The Group believes these regulatory and\nlegislative actions will help to normalize the view of addiction as a chronic disease and expand access to evidence-\nbased buprenorphine treatment in the U.S. and supports these actions.\nFinancial Performance in H1/Q2 2024\nTotal NR in H1 2024 increased 10% to $583m (H1 2023: $529m) at actual exchange rates (+10% at constant\nexchange rates1). In Q2 2024, total NR increased 8% to $299m (Q2 2023: $276m) at actual exchange rates (+9% at\nconstant exchange rates).\nU.S. NR increased 14% in H1 2024 to $494m (H1 2023: $435m) and by 12% in Q2 2024 to $254m (Q2 2023:\n$226m). Strong year-over-year SUBLOCADE volume growth primarily drove the increases in NR in both periods.\nPricing was not a material factor in NR growth.\nRest of World (ROW) NR decreased 5% at actual exchange rates in H1 2024 to $89m (H1 2023: $94m) (-5% at\nconstant exchange rates1). In Q2 2024, ROW NR decreased 10% at actual exchange rates to $45m (Q2 2023: $50m)\n(-8% at constant exchange rates1). In both periods, positive contributions from new products (SUBLOCADE /\nSUBUTEX® Prolonged Release and SUBOXONE Film) were more than offset by the timing of shipments of certain\nlegacy tablet products, along with ongoing generic erosion of the legacy tablet business and elevated stocking in\nQ2 2023. H1 2024 SUBLOCADE / SUBUTEX Prolonged Release NR in ROW increased 25% to $25m (H1 2023: $20m)\nand in Q2 2024 NR increased 30% to $13m (Q2 2023: $10m) at actual exchange rates.\nGross margin as reported in H1 2024 was 76% (H1 2023: 83%) and 69% in Q2 2024 (Q2 2023: 82%). H1 2024 and\nQ2 2024 included $41m of exceptional costs related to the discontinuation of sales and marketing for PERSERIS. In\n1 Net revenue at constant exchange rates is an alternative performance measure used by management to evaluate underlying performance of\nthe business and is calculated by applying the prior year exchange rate to current year net revenue in the currencies of the foreign entities.\n3\naddition, adjustments for amortization of acquired intangible assets within cost of sales of $6m in H1 2024 and\n$3m in Q2 2024 were also included in the reported gross margin. Excluding these exceptional costs and\nadjustments, adjusted gross margin was 84% in both H1 2024 and Q2 2024 (H1 2023 and Q2 2023: 84% and 83%,\nrespectively). The adjusted gross margin in H1 2024 primarily reflects improved product mix from the continued\ngrowth of SUBLOCADE offset by cost inflation. Additionally, both periods benefited from favorable manufacturing\nvariances.\nSG&A expenses as reported in H1 2024 were $457m (H1 2023: $264m) and $311m in Q2 2024 (Q2 2023: $133m).\nH1 2024 and Q2 2024 included $169m and $167m of exceptional items, respectively, (H1 2023 and Q2 2023: $22m\nand $8m, respectively). See \"Appendix\" for adjusted results details of exceptional SG&A expenses for H1 and Q2\n2024 and 2023, which include expenses related to completed and proposed legal settlements, the acquisition of\nOpiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the aseptic manufacturing site, the U.S. listing, and the discontinuation of sales\nand marketing for PERSERIS.\nExcluding exceptional items, H1 2024 adjusted SG&A expense increased 19% to $288m (Adjusted H1 2023:\n$242m); Q2 2024 adjusted SG&A expense increased 15% to $144m (Adjusted Q2 2023: $125m). The increases in\nboth periods primarily reflect greater sales and marketing investments primarily related to SUBLOCADE, OPVEE\nlaunch expenses and cost inflation.\nR&D expenses in H1 2024 and Q2 2024 were $54m and $27m, respectively (H1 2023: $59m; Q2 2023: $32m), and\nrepresented decreases of 8% and 16%, respectively. The decreases in both periods were primarily due to phasing\nof activity related to post-marketing studies for SUBLOCADE, partially offset by investments to advance the Group's\npipeline assets.\nOperating loss as reported was $67m in H1 2024 (H1 2023 operating profit: $118m). The change on a reported\nbasis reflects higher NR offset by lower gross margin and investments in sales and marketing primarily related to\nSUBLOCADE.(see \"Appendix\" for adjusted results details of exceptional expenses included in operating profit.)\nAfter excluding exceptional items and other adjustments of $216m and $24m in H1 2024 and H1 2023,\nrespectively, H1 2024 adjusted operating profit increased 5% to $149m (H1 2023: $142m). The increase primarily\nreflects higher total NR partially offset by increased SG&A expenses.\nQ2 2024 operating loss as reported was $132m (Q2 2023 operating profit: $61m). On an adjusted basis, Q2 2024\noperating profit increased 11% to $79m (adjusted Q2 2023: $71m), excluding exceptional costs and other\nadjustments of $211m (Q2 2023: $10m). The increase on an adjusted basis primarily reflected the same factors as\nnoted above.\nNet finance expense was $5m in H1 2024 (H1 2023: $2m income) reflecting a decrease in interest income on lower\ncash and investment balances.\nReported tax benefit was $12m in H1 2024 and the effective tax rate was 17% (H1 2023 tax expense/rate: $37m,\n31%). H1 2024 adjusted tax expense was $33m, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 23% (H1 2023 adjusted tax\nexpense/rate: $32m, 22%). The adjusted results exclude tax benefits on exceptional items and other adjustments.\nThe movement in the effective tax rate on adjusted profits was impacted by an increase in the U.K. corporation tax\nrate from 23.5% to 25%. The Q2 2024 reported tax benefit was $28m, and the effective tax rate was 21% (Q2 2023:\n$23m, 37%). The tax expense on Q2 2024 adjusted profits was $16m, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 21%.\nThe tax expense on Q2 2023 adjusted profits amounted to $16m, for a comparable adjusted effective tax rate of\n22%.\nReported net loss in H1 2024 was $60m and adjusted net income was $111m (H1 2023 reported net income:\n$83m, adjusted net income: $112m). The 1% decrease in net income on an adjusted basis primarily reflected the\nincrease in operating expense, partly offset by higher total NR. Q2 2024 net loss on a reported basis was $107m\n(Q2 2023: net income $39m), and net income of $60m on an adjusted basis excluding the net after-tax impact from\nexceptional items and other adjustments (Adjusted Q2 2023: $56m). Higher Q2 2024 net income on an adjusted\nbasis was primarily due to strong NR growth.\nDiluted (losses) earnings per share were $(0.44) on a reported basis and $0.81 on an adjusted basis in H1 2024 (H1\n2023: $0.59 diluted earnings per share and $0.79 adjusted diluted earnings per share). In Q2 2024, diluted losses\nper share and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $(0.79) and $0.44, respectively (Q2 2023: $0.27 earnings\nper share on a diluted basis and $0.39 earnings per share adjusted diluted basis).\n4\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\nCash and investments totaled $405m at the end of Q2 2024, a decrease of $46m versus the $451m position at the\nend of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the Group's litigation settlement payments of $70m and share\nrepurchases of $70m, partly offset by cash inflow from operating activities.\nNet working capital, defined by management as inventory plus trade receivables, less trade and other payables,\nwas negative $379m on June 30, 2024, versus negative $347m at the end of FY 2023.\nCash generated from operations in H1 2024 was $82m (H1 2023 cash used in operations: $26m), reflecting\nongoing operating performance partially offset by scheduled litigation payments. Excluding litigation settlement\npayments, cash generated from operations in H1 2024 was $152m. The H1 2024 reported operating outflow\nprimarily relates to litigation settlements not yet paid. Net cash flow from operating activities was $33m in H1\n2024 (H1 2023 cash outflow: $55m) primarily reflecting cash generated from operations less tax payments.\nCash inflow from investing activities in H1 2024 was $27m (H1 2023 cash outflow: $103m) reflecting the net\nreduction in invested liquidity, partially offset by capital expenditure. In the prior year period, the outflow from\ninvesting activities primarily reflected the Opiant acquisition, net of cash assumed, partially offset by a net\nreduction in invested liquidity.\nCash outflow from financing activities in H1 2024 was $74m (H1 2023 cash outflow: $24m) primarily reflecting\nshares repurchased and canceled. In the prior year period, the outflow from financing activities primarily reflected\nshares repurchased and canceled and the extinguishment of debt assumed in the Opiant acquisition.\nPrincipal Risks Update\nThe principal risks facing the Group for the second half of 2024 are expected to be consistent with those disclosed\nin the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.\nExchange Rates\nThe average and period end exchange rates used for the translation of currencies into U.S. dollars that have most\nsignificant impact on the Group’s results were:\n6 Months to June 30, 6 Months to June 30,\n2024 2023\nGB £ period end 1.2626 1.2648\nGB £ average rate 1.2654 1.2329\n€ Euro period end 1.0682 1.0911\n€ Euro average 1.0815 1.0807\nWebcast Details\nA live webcast presentation will be held on July 25, 2024, at 13:00 GMT (8:00 am EDT) hosted by Mark Crossley,\nCEO.

These Condensed\nFinancial Statements were approved for issue on July 25, 2024.\nIn preparing these Condensed Financial Statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the\nGroup’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for changes in estimates that are required\nin determining the provision for income taxes.\nIn 2023, the Group acquired an aseptic manufacturing facility which was accounted for as a business combination. As the\nacquisition was completed in late 2023, a provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of\nacquisition was disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. In Q1 2024,\nbased on new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, the Group\nadjusted the provisional fair values for acquired property, plant and equipment and the assumed onerous contract\nprovision, with an adjustment to goodwill equal to the change in the net assets acquired. These measurement period\nadjustments are reflected in the comparative period presented in the Condensed Financial Statements in accordance with\nIFRS 3 Business Combinations. The effect on depreciation and other changes in the related balances from the acquisition\ndate to December 31, 2023 was immaterial. Refer to Note 17 for a reconciliation of the previously reported provisional fair\nvalue of net assets acquired to the adjusted provisional fair value.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the functional currency of Indivior U.K. Limited, one of the Group’s significant subsidiaries,\nchanged from pound sterling to U.S. dollar (USD). This was the result of a change in the primary economic environment in\nwhich Indivior U.K. Limited operates, driven by growth of USD-denominated net revenue combined with an increase in\nUSD-denominated costs and culminating with a shift in investing activities to USD securities. The Group determined the\nUSD had become the dominant currency from January 2024.\nThe Directors have assessed the Group’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its operations, fulfill financial and\ncompliance obligations as set out in Note 11, and comply with the minimum liquidity covenant in the Group’s term loan for\nthe period to December 2025 (the going concern period). A base case model was produced reflecting:\n• Board reviewed financial plans for the period; and\n• settlement of liabilities and provisions in line with contractual terms.\nThe Directors also assessed a ‘severe but plausible’ downside scenario which included the following key changes to the\nbase case within the going concern period:\n• the risk that SUBLOCADE will not meet revenue growth expectations by modeling a 10% decline on forecasts;\n• an accelerated decline in U.S. SUBOXONE Film net revenue to generic analogues; and\n• a further decline in rest of world sublingual product net revenues.\nUnder both the base case and the downside scenario, sufficient liquidity exists and is generated from operations such that\nall business and covenant requirements are met for the going concern period. Additionally, no material legal cases are\nexpected to come to trial during the going concern period. As a result of the analysis described above, the Directors\nreasonably expect the Group to have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least one year from\nthe approval of these Condensed Financial Statements and therefore consider the going concern basis to be appropriate\nfor the accounting and preparation of these Condensed Financial Statements.\nThe financial information contained in this document does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 and\n435 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group’s statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, were\napproved by the Board of Directors on March 5, 2024 and will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in due course.\nThe auditor's report on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not\ncontain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\n12\n2. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Group is engaged in a single business activity, which is predominantly the development, manufacture, and sale of\nbuprenorphine-based prescription drugs for treatment of opioid dependence and related disorders. The CEO reviews\ndisaggregated net revenue on a geographical and product basis and allocates resources on a functional basis between\nCommercial, Supply, Research and Development, and other Group functions. Financial results are reviewed on a\nconsolidated basis for evaluating financial performance and allocating resources. Accordingly, the Group operates in a\nsingle reportable segment.\nNet revenue\nRevenue is attributed geographically based on the country where the sale originates. The following table represents net\nrevenue by country:\nQ2 Q2 H1 H1\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and six months ended June 30 $m $m $m $m\nUnited States 254 226 494 435\nRest of World 45 50 89 94\nTotal 299 276 583 529\nOn a disaggregated basis, the Group’s net revenue by major product line:\nQ2 Q2 H1 H1\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and six months ended June 30 $m $m $m $m\nSUBLOCADE® 192 155 371 287\nPERSERIS®1 13 11 23 19\nSublingual/other2 94 110 189 223\nTotal 299 276 583 529\n1Sales and marketing for PERSERIS® have been discontinued.

Expenses in the 2023 periods include the acquisition of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Opiant\", Note 16) and the preparation\nof the additional listing of Indivior shares on Nasdaq.\n13\n2 Depreciation and amortization expense represents amounts included in research and development and selling, general and\nadministrative expenses. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense in H1 2024 of $27m (H1 2023: $5m) and Q2 2024 of $21m\n(Q2 2023: $3m) for intangible assets and right-of-use assets is included within cost of sales and includes the impact of the discontinuation\nof sales and marketing for PERSERIS.\n4.

TAXATION\nThe Group calculates tax expense for interim periods using the expected full year rates, considering the pre-tax income and\nstatutory rates for each jurisdiction. To the extent practicable, a separate estimated average annual effective income tax\nrate is determined for each taxing jurisdiction and applied individually to the interim period pre-tax income of each\njurisdiction. Similarly, if different income tax rates apply to different categories of income (such as capital gains or income\nearned in particular industries), to the extent practicable a separate rate is applied to each individual category of interim\nperiod pre-tax income. The resulting expense is allocated between current and deferred taxes based on actual movement\nin deferred tax for the quarter, with the balance recorded to the current tax accounts.\nQ2 Q2 H1 H1\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and six months ended June 30 $m $m $m $m\nTotal tax benefit (expense) 28 (23) 12 (37)\nEffective tax rate (%) 21 % 37 % 17 % 31 %\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2024, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by prior year\ndisallowance of executive compensation and higher litigation expenses.\nDec 31, 2023\nJun 30, (Retrospectively\n2024 adjusted1)\n$m $m\nCurrent tax receivable 22 —\nCurrent tax liabilities (8) (18)\nDeferred tax assets 290 267\n1 The deferred tax assets balance as of December 31, 2023 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect a measurement period adjustment\nrelated to the November 2023 acquisition of an aseptic manufacturing facility. Refer to Note 17.\nThe Group recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that sufficient future taxable profits are probable against which\nthese future tax deductions can be utilized. At June 30, 2024, the Group’s net deferred tax assets of $290m relate primarily\nto net operating loss carryforwards, inventory costs capitalized for tax purposes, and litigation liabilities. Recognition of\ndeferred tax assets is reliant on forecast taxable profits arising in the jurisdiction in which the deferred tax asset is\nrecognized. The Group has assessed recoverability of deferred tax assets using Group-level budgets and forecasts\nconsistent with those used for the assessment of viability and asset impairments, particularly in relation to levels of future\nnet revenues. These forecasts are subject to similar uncertainties to those assessments. This is reviewed each quarter and,\nto the extent required, an adjustment to the recognized deferred tax asset may be made. With the exception of specific\nassets that are not currently considered realizable, management have concluded full recognition of deferred tax assets to\nbe appropriate and do not believe a significant risk of material change in their assessment exists in the next 12 months\nfrom the balance sheet date.\nOther tax matters\nThe Group is subject to Pillar Two legislation effective January 1, 2024. As such, the Group performed an assessment of the\npotential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes including modeling of adjusted accounting data for the period ended\n14\nDecember 31, 2023 and a review of forecasts for the year ended December 31, 2024. Based on the assessment, the Group\ndid not record any current tax liability related to Pillar Two. The Group has applied the recent amendment to IAS 12 which\nprovides temporary relief to the recognition of deferred taxes relating to top-up income taxes.\nAs a multinational group, tax uncertainties remain in relation to Group financing, intercompany pricing, the location of\ntaxable operations, and certain non-recurring costs. Management have concluded tax provisions made to be appropriate\nand do not believe a significant risk of material change to uncertain tax positions exists in the next 12 months from the\nbalance sheet date. Including matters under audit, an estimate of reasonably possible additional tax liabilities and interest\nthat could arise in later periods on resolution of these uncertainties is in the range from nil to $56m.\n6. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe table below sets out basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share for each period:\nQ2 Q2 H1 H1\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and six months ended June 30 $ $ $ $\nBasic (loss) earnings per share $(0.79) $0.28 $(0.44) $0.61\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share $(0.79) $0.27 $(0.44) $0.59\nWeighted average number of shares\nThe weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (on a basic basis) for H1 2024 includes the favorable impact\nof 3,898k ordinary shares repurchased in H1 2024 and 1,413k ordinary shares repurchased from April to December 2023.\nSee Note 15 for further discussion.

As of June 30, 2024, expected credit losses for the\nGroup’s investments held at amortized cost are deemed to be immaterial.\nFair value hierarchy\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability\nThe Group’s only financial instruments which are measured at fair value are equity securities at FVPL. The fair value of\nequity securities at FVPL is based on quoted market prices on the measurement date. The following table categorizes the\nGroup’s financial assets measured at fair value by valuation methodology used in determining their fair value:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAt June 30, 2024 $m $m $m $m\nEquity securities at FVPL 9 — — 9\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAt December 31, 2023 $m $m $m $m\nEquity securities at FVPL 10 — — 10\nThe Group also has certain financial instruments which are not measured at fair value. The carrying value of cash and cash\nequivalents, trade receivables, other assets, and trade and other payables is assumed to approximate fair value due to\ntheir short-term nature. At June 30, 2024, the carrying value of investments held at amortized cost approximated the fair\nvalue. The fair value of investments held at amortized cost was calculated based on quoted market prices which would be\nclassified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy above.\n9.

Long-term prepaid expenses primarily relate to payments for contract manufacturing capacity.\n10. FINANCIAL LIABILITIES – BORROWINGS\nThe table below sets out the current and non-current portion obligation of the Group’s term loan:\nJun 30, Dec 31,\n2024 2023\nTerm loan $m $m\nTerm loan – current (3) (3)\nTerm loan – non-current (235) (236)\nTotal term loan (238) (239)\n*Total term loan borrowings reflect the principal amount drawn including debt issuance costs of $5m (FY 2023: $5m).\n16\nAt June 30, 2024, the term loan fair value was approximately 100% (FY 2023: 100%) of par value. The key terms of this loan\nin effect at June 30, 2024, are as follows:\nRequired\nannual Minimum\nCurrency Nominal interest margin Maturity repayments liquidity\nTerm loan facility USD SOFR + 0.26% + 5.25% 2026 1% Larger of $100m or 50% of loan balance\nThe term loan amounting to $243m (FY 2023: $244m) is secured against the assets of certain subsidiaries of the Group in\nthe form of guarantees issued by respective subsidiaries.\n• Nominal interest margin is calculated as USD SOFR plus 26 bps, subject to a floor of 0.75%, plus a credit spread\nadjustment of 5.25%.\n• There are no revolving credit commitments.\n11.

Refer to Note 17.\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims\nAs previously disclosed, settlement agreements were entered into during 2023 with three plaintiff classes to fully resolve\ncertain multi-district antitrust claims. Indivior has no further obligations related to this matter.\nOpioid litigation\nA provision of $75m was recorded in Q2 2024, reflecting the present value of the agreed amount in a preliminary\nsettlement between Indivior, the plaintiffs' executive committee and certain state attorneys general covering certain\nopioid litigation (including the Opioid MDL) brought by municipalities and tribes. The outflow of resources is expected to\noccur over five years. The parties still must negotiate material terms and conditions of the final settlement agreement,\nincluding structure, and scope of releases. The provision is measured using a risk free rate and will be remeasured at a risk-\nadjusted rate upon reaching a final settlement agreement, at which time the Group expects to make a further disclosure.\nRefer to Note 13.\nOnerous contracts\nIn November 2023, the Group acquired a business consisting of a manufacturing facility, workforce, and supply contracts.\nThe facility is obligated to fulfill contracts that existed pre-acquisition for which the expected costs are in excess of the\nconsideration expected to be received. The Group recorded a provision for these onerous contracts in the allocation of\npurchase price, with a balance at the end of the quarter of $15m (FY 2023: $22m). During the quarter, net operating losses\nattributable to the contracts of $2m were recorded against the provision. Refer to Note 17. Manufacturing under the\nonerous contracts is expected to be completed during Q1 2025 and the provision is recorded at its discounted value, using\na market rate at the time of the transaction determined to be 7.6%.\nFalse Claims Act allegations\nThe Group carries a provision of $4m (FY 2023: $4m) pertaining to an outstanding False Claims Act allegation as discussed\nin Note 13. This matter is expected to be settled within the next 12 months.\nOther\nOther provisions of $2m (FY 2023: $2m) represent retirement benefit costs which are not expected to be settled within one\nyear.\n17\nOther liabilities\nTotal Total\nNon- Jun 30, Non- Dec 31,\nCurrent Current 2024 Current Current 2023\nCurrent and non-current other liabilities $m $m $m $m $m $m\nDOJ resolution (51) (295) (346) (53) (344) (397)\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims — — — (30) — (30)\nOther antitrust matters (85) — (85) — — —\nIntellectual property related matters — — — (11) — (11)\nRB indemnity settlement (8) (7) (15) (8) (15) (23)\nShare repurchase (4) — (4) (23) — (23)\nOther — (12) (12) — (8) (8)\nTotal other liabilities (148) (314) (462) (125) (367) (492)\nDOJ Resolution Agreement\nIn July 2020, the Group settled criminal and civil liability with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), and U.S. state attorneys general. Pursuant to the resolution agreement, aggregate\npayments of $263m (including interest) have been made through June 30, 2024, including a payment of $53m in January\n2024. Annual installments of $50m plus interest are due every January 15 from 2025 to 2027, with the final installment of\n$200m due in December 2027. The Group has the option to prepay. Interest accrues at 1.25% on certain portions of the\nresolution and will be paid with the installment payments. For non-interest-bearing portions, the liability has been\nrecorded at the net present value based on timing of the estimated payments using a discount rate equal to the interest\nrate on the interest-bearing portions. In H1 2024, the Group recorded interest expense totaling $2m (H1 2023: $3m).\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims\nAs previously disclosed, settlement agreements were entered into during 2023 with three plaintiff classes to fully resolve\ncertain multi-district antitrust claims. Indivior has no further obligations related to this matter.\nOther antitrust matters\nCertain antitrust cases filed in Virginia state court by Health Care Service Corp. (HCSC), Blue Cross Blue Shield of\nMassachusetts, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, Molina, and Aetna were settled by agreement of the parties on July 8,\n2024 for $85m and mutual releases of claims and counterclaims. A liability was recorded at June 30, 2024 and the\nsettlement will be paid in July 2024. Refer to note 13.\nIP related matters\nOther liabilities for intellectual property related matters relate to the settlement of litigation with DRL in June 2022. Under\nthe settlement agreement, the Group made a final payment to DRL of $12m during Q1 2024 and has no further obligations\nrelated to this matter.\nRB indemnity settlement\nUnder the RB indemnity settlement, the Group has paid $34m of the $50m settlement agreement through June 30, 2024\nincluding $8m paid in January 2024. Remaining annual installment payments of $8m are due in January 2025 and 2026. The\nGroup carries a liability totaling $15m (FY 2023: $23m) related to this settlement. This liability has been recorded at the net\npresent value, using a market interest rate at the time of the settlement determined to be 3.75%, considering the timing of\npayments and other factors. In H1 2024, the Group recorded nil of finance expense (H1 2023: nil) for time value of money\non the liability.\nShare repurchase\nIn November 2023, the Group commenced a share repurchase program of $100m. As of June 30, 2024, the liability of $4m\nrepresents the amount to be spent under the program through July 26, 2024, after which date the Company has the ability\nto modify or terminate the program. As of December 31, 2023, the current liability of $23m represented the amount to be\nspent under the program through February 23, 2024.\nOther\nOther liabilities primarily represent employee related liabilities which are non-current as of June 30, 2024.\n12. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nThe Group has assessed certain legal and other matters to be not probable based upon current facts and circumstances,\nincluding any potential impact the DOJ resolution could have on these matters. Where liabilities related to these matters\nare determined to be possible, they represent contingent liabilities. Except for those matters discussed in Note 13 under\n“Civil Opioid Litigation” and “False Claims Act Allegations”, for which provisions have been recognized, Note 13 sets out the\ndetails for legal and other disputes which the Group has assessed as contingent liabilities. Where the Group believes it is\npossible to reasonably estimate a range for the contingent liability, this has been disclosed.\n18\n13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThere are certain ongoing legal proceedings or threats of legal proceedings in which the Group is a party, but in which the\nGroup believes the possibility of an adverse impact is remote and they are not discussed in this Note.\nAntitrust Litigation and Consumer Protection\n• Beginning in 2020, cases by (1) Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc., Blue Cross and Blue Shield of\nMassachusetts HMO Blue, Inc., (2) Health Care Service Corp., (3) Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, Inc., Health\nOptions, Inc., (4) BCBSM, Inc. (d/b/a Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota) and HMO Minnesota (d/b/a Blue Plus),\n(5) Molina Healthcare, Inc., and (6) Aetna Inc. were filed in the Circuit Court for the County of Roanoke, Virginia. See\nHealth Care Services Corp. v. Indivior Inc., No. CL20-1474 (Lead Case) (Va. Cir. Ct.) (Roanoke Cnty). In July 2023, Indivior\nInc. and BCBSM, Inc. and HMO Minnesota agreed to mutual releases and settlement. The remaining plaintiffs asserted\nclaims under federal and state RICO statutes, state antitrust statutes, state statutes prohibiting unfair and deceptive\npractices, state statutes prohibiting insurance fraud, and common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust\nenrichment. The Group filed demurrers, which the court sustained in part and overruled in part. Separately, Indivior\nInc. filed counterclaims against several plaintiffs alleging violations of certain insurance fraud statutes. The plaintiffs\ndemurred. The court overruled HCSC's demurrer but sustained the demurrers of the remaining plaintiffs named in\nIndivior Inc.'s counterclaims. A jury trial on the merits was set for July 15, 2024 – August 15, 2024. The parties\nparticipated in an in-person mediation session on June 11, 2024. On July 8, 2024, the parties reached an agreement to\nsettle all claims and counterclaims for $85m.\n• Humana, Inc. filed a Complaint in state court in Kentucky on August 20, 2021 with claims substantially similar to those\nasserted by other end payors in the HCSC consolidated litigation. See Humana Inc. v. Indivior Inc., No. 21-CI-004833\n(Ky. Cir. Ct.) (Jefferson Cnty). The court lifted a stay on October 30, 2023. Indivior moved to dismiss the complaint in\nFebruary 2024. Indivior's motion remains pending. The Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has\nmeritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation,\nno estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\n• Centene Corporation, Wellcare Healthcare Plans, Inc., New York Quality Healthcare Corp. (d/b/a Fidelis Care), and\nHealth Net, LLC filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for the County of Roanoke, Virginia alleging similar claims on\nJanuary 13, 2023. See Centene Corp. v. Indivior Inc., No. CL23000054-00 (Va. Cir. Ct.) (Roanoke Cnty). Indivior\ndemurred to the complaint and asserted pleas in bar in early February 2024. In May 2024, the court sustained in part\nand overruled in part Indivior's demurrers, and took under advisement Indivior's demurrer on statute of limitations\ngrounds. The Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to\nvigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be\nmade at this time.\n• As previously disclosed in 2023, Indivior Inc. settled claims of all plaintiff groups in the company's antitrust multi-\ndistrict litigation (\"Antitrust MDL\") namely, (i) 41 states and the District of Columbia (the \"States\"), (ii) end payors, and\n(iii) direct purchasers (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\"). Indivior Inc. reached a settlement with the States for $103m on\nJune 1, 2023. Indivior Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the end payor class for $30m on August 14, 2023\nand received final court approval on December 5, 2023. On October 22, 2023, Indivior Inc. entered into a settlement\nagreement with the remaining direct purchaser class for $385m, which received final court approval on February 27,\n2024.\n• In 2013, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc. \"RBPI,\" now known as Indivior Inc. received notice that it and other\ncompanies were defendants in a lawsuit initiated by writ in the Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) Court of Common\nPleas. See Carefirst of Maryland, Inc. et al. v. Reckitt Benckiser Inc., et al., Case. No. 2875, December Term 2013. The\nplaintiffs included approximately 79 entities, most of which appeared to be insurance companies or other providers of\nhealth benefits plans. The claims of all plaintiffs in the Carefirst action except Humana Inc. and certain of its affiliates\nwere resolved in connection with final approval of the end payor settlement in the Antitrust MDL, and accordingly\ndismissed on February 14, 2024. The claims of Humana Inc. and certain of its affiliates in the Carefirst action remain\npending. The Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to\nvigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be\nmade at this time.\nCivil Opioid Litigation\n• The Group has been named as a defendant in more than 400 civil lawsuits alleging that manufacturers, distributors,\nand retailers of opioids engaged in a longstanding practice to market opioids as safe and effective for the treatment of\nlong-term chronic pain to increase the market for opioids and their own market shares for opioids, or alleging\nindividual personal injury claims. Most of these cases have been consolidated and are pending in a federal multi-\ndistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. See In re National Prescription Opiate\nLitigation, MDL No. 2804 (N.D. Ohio) (the \"Opioid MDL\"). Nearly two-thirds of the cases in the Opioid MDL were filed\nby cities and counties, while nearly one-third of the cases were filed by individual plaintiffs, most of whom assert\nclaims relating to neonatal abstinence syndrome (\"NAS\"). Litigation against the Group in the Opioid MDL is stayed.\n• Pursuant to mediation, the Group, the Plaintiffs' Executive Committee in the Opioid MDL, and certain state attorneys\ngeneral reached agreement on the amount of a potential settlement. The Group has recorded a related provision of\n$75m, reflecting the net present value (NPV) of the agreed amount (See Note 11). The parties, however, still must\n19\nnegotiate material terms and conditions of the final settlement agreement, including structure and scope of the\nrelease. The proposed settlement does not include private plaintiffs.\n• Separately, Indivior Inc. was named as one of numerous defendants in civil opioid cases that are not part of the Opioid\nMDL:\n◦ Indivior was named as one of numerous defendants in various other federal and state court cases that are not in\nthe Opioid MDL and were brought by municipalities. These cases include, for example, 35 actions filed in New\nYork state court that were removed to federal court, as well as cases filed in federal district courts sitting in\nAlabama, Florida, Georgia, and New Mexico. On motion of the plaintiffs, the New York cases were remanded\nback to state court. Other named defendants have filed a notice of appeal regarding the remand. The plaintiffs in\nthe case filed in the Northern District of Alabama voluntarily dismissed their complaint, subject to certain tolling\nagreements. The various other federal actions currently are stayed, except Indivior moved to dismiss the\ncomplaint in San Miguel Hospital Corp. d/b/a Alta Vista Regional Medical Center v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No.\n1:23-cv-00903 (D.N.M.) in May 2024. Indivior's motion to dismiss remains pending.\n◦ Indivior Inc. was named as a defendant in five individual complaints filed in West Virginia state court that were\ntransferred to West Virginia's Mass Litigation Panel. See In re Opioid Litigation, No. 22-C-9000 NAS (W.V.\nKanawha Cnty. Cir. Ct.) (\"WV MLP Action\"). All five of Indivior Inc.'s cases in the WV MLP Action involve claims\nrelated to NAS. Indivior Inc. moved to dismiss all five complaints on January 30, 2023. By order dated April 17,\n2023, the court granted Indivior's motions to dismiss. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on June 30, 2023. Oral\nargument on the appeal has been set for September 17, 2024.\n• Additionally, on May 23, 2024, the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland\nserved on Indivior Inc. an administrative subpoena related generally to opioid products marketed and sold in\nMaryland.\n• The Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously\ndefend itself in the private plaintiff actions. Given the status and preliminary stage of litigation in both the Opioid MDL\nand the separate federal and state court actions for the private plaintiff cases, no estimate of possible loss in the\nopioid litigation for the private plaintiffs can be made at this time.\nFalse Claims Act Allegations\n• In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia unsealed a declined qui tam\ncomplaint alleging causes of action under the Federal and state False Claims Acts against certain entities within the\nGroup predicated on best price issues and claims of retaliation. See United States ex rel. Miller v. Reckitt Benckiser\nGroup PLC et al., Case No. 1:15-cv-00017 (W.D. Va.). The suit also seeks reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The\nGroup filed a Motion to Dismiss in June 2021, which was granted in part and denied in part on October 17, 2023. The\nrelator filed a sixth amended complaint against only Indivior Inc. on December 7, 2023. Indivior answered the sixth\namended complaint on March 18, 2024.\n• In May 2018, Indivior Inc. received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office (“USAO”) for the\nSouthern District of New York, seeking records relating to the SUBOXONE Film manufacturing process. The Group\nprovided the USAO certain information regarding allegations that the government received regarding SUBOXONE\nFilm. There has been no communication regarding this matter with the USAO since 2022.\nU.K. Shareholder Claims\n• On September 21, 2022, certain shareholders issued representative and multiparty claims against Indivior PLC in the\nHigh Court of Justice for the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, King’s Bench Division. On January 16,\n2023, the representative served its Particular of Claims setting forth in more detail the claims against the Group, while\nthe same law firm that represents the representative also sent its draft Particular of Claims for the multiparty action.\nThe claims made in both the representative and multiparty actions generally allege that Indivior PLC violated the U.K.\nFinancial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA 2000”) by making false or misleading statements or material\nomissions in public disclosures, including the 2014 Demerger Prospectus, regarding an alleged product-hopping\nscheme regarding the switch from SUBOXONE Tablets to SUBOXONE Film. Indivior PLC filed an application to strike\nout the representative action. On December 5, 2023, the court handed down a judgment allowing the Group's\napplication to strike out the representative action. The court subsequently awarded certain costs to the Group. On\nJanuary 23, 2024, the claimants requested permission to appeal the decision to the court of appeals. The appellate\ncourt has indicated that it will hear the appeal between December 10 and 12, 2024. The Group has begun its\nevaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status\nand preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\n20\nOpiant Shareholder Claims\n• On November 8, 2023, plaintiff James Litten filed a class action complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery\nalleging that former officers and directors of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Opiant\") breached fiduciary duties of\ncare, loyalty, and good faith in connection with Indivior PLC's 2022 acquisition of Opiant. The defendants moved\nto dismiss the complaint on January 26, 2024. On March 21, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint,\nwhich added Lazard Freres & Co. LLC, which was Opiant's advisor in the acquisition as a defendant. The\ndefendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on June 21, 2024. The motion to dismiss remains pending.\nThe Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously\ndefend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at\nthis time.\nDental Allegations\n• The Group has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging that Suboxone® Film was defectively\ndesigned and caused dental injury, and that the Group failed to properly warn of the risks of such injuries. The\nplaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages, as well as punitive damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. Plaintiffs\nand potential plaintiffs related to these lawsuits generally can be grouped as follows:\n▪ Dental MDL Plaintiffs: More than 675 of these cases have been consolidated in multi-district litigation in the\nNorthern District of Ohio. See In Re Suboxone (Buprenorphine/Naloxone) Film Products Liability Litigation,\nMDL No. 3092 (N.D. Oh.) (the \"Dental MDL\").\n▪ Dental MDL Schedule A Plaintiffs: One complaint filed in the Dental MDL on June 14, 2024 attached a\nschedule of nearly 10,000 plaintiffs (the “Schedule A Plaintiffs”). The parties are in the process of negotiating\na tolling agreement for the Schedule A Plaintiffs that would permit plaintiffs’ counsel additional time to\ninvestigate issues such as whether and when the Schedule A Plaintiffs used any Indivior product before\ndetermining whether to file individual complaints that ultimately would be coordinated with the Dental\nMDL.\n▪ State Court Plaintiffs: One complaint has been filed in New Jersey state court, and the parties have agreed to\ntoll the claims of more than 850 other individuals in Delaware, New Jersey, and Virginia. Complaints have\nnot yet been filed on behalf of the tolled individuals.\n• Product liability cases such as these typically involve issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance\non those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual/provable injury and other matters. These cases are in their\npreliminary stages. These lawsuits and claims follow a June 2022 required revision to the Prescribing Information and\nPatient Medication Guide about dental problems reported in connection with buprenorphine medicines dissolved in\nthe mouth to treat opioid use disorder. This revision was required by the FDA of all manufacturers of these products.\nThe Group has been informed by its primary insurance carrier that defense costs for the Dental MDL should begin to\nbe reimbursed now that the Group's self-insurance retention has been exhausted. To date, the primary insurance\ncarrier has reimbursed the Group for $0.1m in defense costs. Additionally, the Group's primary insurance carrier has\nissued a reservation of rights against payment of any liability costs. In the event of a liability finding, various factors\ncould affect reimbursement or payment by insurers, if any, including (i) the scope of the insurers’ purported defenses\nand exclusions to avoid coverage, (ii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, (iii) delays in or avoidance of payment\nby insurers and (iv) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future. The Group has begun its\nevaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status\nand preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\n• Applications to file class actions based on similar allegations as in the Dental MDL were filed in Quebec and British\nColumbia against various subsidiaries of the Group, among other defendants, in April 2024. The Group has begun its\nevaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status\nand preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\n14.

In H1 2024, net settlement of tax on employee equity awards was $20m (H1 2023: $21m).\nShares repurchased and canceled\nOn May 3, 2022, the Group commenced a share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price up to no more than\n$100m or 39,699k of ordinary shares, (equivalent shares post share consolidation: 7,940k) which concluded on February\n28, 2023. During the prior period, the Company repurchased and canceled 484k ordinary shares with a nominal value of\n$0.50 each.\nOn November 17, 2023, the Group commenced a share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price up to no more\nthan $100m or 13,632k of ordinary shares and ending no later than August 30, 2024. During the period, the Group\nrepurchased and canceled a total of 3,898k ordinary shares at $0.50 per share under this program for an aggregate\nnominal value of $2m.\nAll ordinary shares repurchased during the period under share repurchase programs were canceled resulting in a transfer\nof the aggregate nominal value to a capital redemption reserve. The total cost of the purchases made under the share\nrepurchase program during the period, including directly attributable transaction costs, was $70m (H1 2023: $11m). A net\nrepurchase amount of $4m has been recorded as a financial liability and reduction of retained earnings which represents\nthe amount to be spent under the program through July 26, 2024, after which date the Company has the ability to modify\nor terminate the program. Total purchases under the share repurchase program will be made out of distributable profits.\n16. ACQUISITION OF OPIANT\nOn March 2, 2023, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opiant for upfront cash consideration of $146m and an\nadditional maximum amount of $8.00 per share in Contingent Value Rights (CVR) to be potentially paid upon achievement\nof net sales milestones. As a result of the acquisition, the Group added OPVEE (nalmefene nasal spray), an opioid overdose\ntreatment well-suited to confront illicit synthetic opioids like fentanyl, to its addiction science portfolio. OPVEE was\napproved by the FDA in May 2023 and launched in October 2023.\nSince substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in the OPVEE in-process research and\ndevelopment, the Group accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded an intangible asset of $126m.\nThe cash outflow for the acquisition was $124m in Q1 2023, net of cash acquired, and inclusive of direct transaction costs.\nAs part of the acquisition, the Group assumed outstanding debt of $10m which was settled and included as a cash outflow\nfrom financing activities.\nAdditional acquisition-related costs of $16m were incurred in H1 2023 and included in selling, general, and administrative\nexpenses, primarily relating to severance, acceleration of vesting of Opiant employee share compensation, and short-term\nretention accruals.\n22\n17. BUSINESS COMBINATION\nOn November 1, 2023, the Group acquired an aseptic manufacturing facility (the \"Facility\") in the United States for upfront\nconsideration of $5m in cash and assumption of certain contract manufacturing obligations. The Facility will be further\ndeveloped to secure the long-term production and supply of SUBLOCADE.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance\nwith IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value, with the excess\nof the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognized as goodwill. An onerous\ncontract provision was recorded at fair value to reflect the present value of the expected losses from assumed contractual\nmanufacturing obligations. Net operating losses attributable to these contractual obligations will be recorded against the\nonerous contract provision from the date of acquisition through fulfillment of the contracts in early 2025.\nAs of June 30, 2024, committed capital spend for the Facility is approximately $7m.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nAs the acquisition was completed in late 2023, the provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the\ndate of acquisition was disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. During\nQ1 2024, based on new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, the\nGroup adjusted the provisional fair values for acquired property, plant and equipment and the assumed onerous contract\nprovision, with an adjustment to goodwill equal to the change in the net assets acquired. These measurement period\nadjustments were reflected in the comparative period presented in the Condensed Financial Statements in accordance\nwith IFRS 3 Business Combinations.The following table provides a reconciliation from the provisional fair values of assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition as reported in the 2023 annual financial statements to the\nprovisional fair values as adjusted during Q1 2024:\nProvisional values\nMeasurement\nAs Previously period\nReported adjustment As adjusted\nNet assets acquired $m $m $m\nProperty, plant and equipment 28 (2) 26\nDeferred tax assets 2 (1) 1\nTrade and other payables (1) — (1)\nProvisions (29) 6 (23)\nTotal net assets acquired — 3 3\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognized as follows, reflecting the Q1 2024 measurement period\nadjustments:\nProvisional values\nMeasurement\nAs Previously period\nReported adjustment As adjusted\n$m $m $m\nConsideration transferred 5 — 5\nLess: Fair value of net assets acquired — (3) (3)\nGoodwill 5 (3) 2\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to Indivior-specific synergies relating to accelerated in-sourcing of SUBLOCADE\nproduction and the skills and technical talent of the Facility's workforce.\n23\n18. DISCONTINUATION OF PERSERIS SALES & MARKETING\nAs announced on July 9, 2024, the Group discontinued sales and marketing support for PERSERIS. This decision was taken\nin consideration of guidance on regulatory changes announced during Q2 2024 which are expected to intensify payor\nmanagement of the treatment category in which PERSERIS competes and would make PERSERIS no longer financial viable.\nWhile the Group will continue to supply PERSERIS for the foreseeable future, the expected adverse impacts represented an\nimpairment indicator for PERSERIS-related assets, resulting in an impairment charge across the following asset classes:\nQ2 2024\nImpairment charges and write downs $m\nCharged to cost of goods sold\nMarketed product intangible 9\nPlant and equipment 8\nInventory 24\nSub-total: Cost of goods sold 41\nCharged to SG&A: Other assets 1\nTotal impairment charges 42\nSee also Note 19.\n19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIn addition to the impairment charges recognized in the Condensed Financial Statements discussed in Note 18, the decision\nto discontinue sales and marketing of PERSERIS resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 130 employees and\ndecisions to terminate related contract manufacturing agreements. As a result of these actions, the Group expects to\nrecognize severance and contract termination costs of approximately $23m during Q3 2024, the bulk of which will be paid\nduring H2 2024.\nOn July 23, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $100m share repurchase program under its authority from\nthe shareholder resolution announced at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. This new program is expected to commence\nimmediately upon the conclusion of the Group's current $100m share repurchase program.\n24\nDIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT\nThe directors confirm that these condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance\nwith UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure\nGuidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and that\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 and DTR 4.2.8,\nnamely:\n• an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months and their impact on\nthe condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties\nfor the remaining six months of the financial year; and\n• material related-party transactions in the first six months and any material changes in the related-\nparty transactions described in the last annual report\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the\nUnited Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from\nlegislation in other jurisdictions.\nDetails of Indivior PLC’s Directors are available on our website at www.indivior.com\nBy order of the Board\nMark Crossley Ryan Preblick\nChief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer\nJuly 24, 2024\n25\nIndependent review report to Indivior PLC\nReport on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements\nOur conclusion\nWe have reviewed Indivior PLC’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim financial\nstatements”) in the H1 and Q2 2024 Financial Results of Indivior PLC for the three and six month periods ended 30\nJune 2024.\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial\nstatements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting\nStandard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the\nUnited Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.\nThe interim financial statements comprise:\n• the Condensed consolidated interim balance sheet as at 30 June 2024;\n• the Condensed consolidated interim income statement and Condensed consolidated interim statement of\ncomprehensive income for the three and six month periods then ended;\n• the Condensed consolidated interim cash flow statement for the six month period then ended;\n• the Condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity for the six month period then ended;\nand\n• the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.\nThe interim financial statements included in the H1 and Q2 2024 Financial Results of Indivior PLC have been\nprepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the\nDisclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.\nBasis for conclusion\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410, ‘Review of\nInterim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Financial Reporting\nCouncil for use in the United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK) 2410”). A review of interim financial information consists of\nmaking enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and\nother review procedures.\nA review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on\nAuditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all\nsignificant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nWe have read the other information contained in the H1 and Q2 2024 Financial Results and considered whether it\ncontains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial\nstatements.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis\nfor conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have\ninappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material\nuncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review\nprocedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may cause the\ngroup to cease to continue as a going concern.\nResponsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review\nOur responsibilities and those of the directors\nThe H1 and Q2 2024 Financial Results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has\nbeen approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the H1 and Q2 2024 Financial Results in\naccordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial\nConduct Authority. In preparing the H1 and Q2 2024 Financial Results, including the interim financial statements, the\ndirectors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,\nmatters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend\nto liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n26\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the H1 and Q2 2024 Financial\nResults based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions relating to going concern, is based on\nprocedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this\nreport. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of\ncomplying with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial\nConduct Authority and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for\nany other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save\nwhere expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChartered Accountants\nLondon\n24 July 2024\n27\nAPPENDIX: ADJUSTED RESULTS\nExceptional items and other adjustments\nExceptional items and other adjustments represent significant expenses or income that do not reflect the Group’s ongoing\noperations or the adjustment of which may help with the comparison to prior periods. Exceptional items and other\nadjustments are excluded from adjusted results consistent with the internal reporting provided to management and the\nDirectors. Examples of such items could include income or restructuring and related expenses from the reconfiguration of\nthe Group’s activities and/or capital structure, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of current and non-\ncurrent assets, gains and losses from the sale of intangible assets, certain costs arising as a result of significant and non-\nrecurring regulatory and litigation matters, and certain tax related matters.\nAdjusted results are not measures defined by IFRS and are not a substitute for, or superior to, reported results presented in\naccordance with IFRS. Adjusted results as presented by the Group are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies. As a result, these performance measures should not be considered in isolation from,\nor as a substitute analysis for, the Group's reported results presented in accordance with IFRS. Management performs a\nquantitative and qualitative assessment to determine if an item should be considered for adjustment. The table below sets\nout exceptional items and other adjustments recorded in each period:\nQ2 Q2 H1 H1\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFor the three and six months ended June 30 $m $m $m $m\nExceptional items and other adjustments within cost of sales\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets1 (3) (2) (6) (2)\nDiscontinuation of sales and marketing for PERSERIS2 (41) — (41) —\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments within cost of sales (44) (2) (47) (2)\nExceptional items and other adjustments within SG&A\nLegal costs/provision3 (160) — (160) —\nDiscontinuation of sales and marketing for PERSERIS2 (1) — (1) —\nAcquisition-related costs4 (2) (4) (4) (16)\nU.S. listing costs5 (4) (4) (4) (6)\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments within SG&A (167) (8) (169) (22)\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments before taxes (211) (10) (216) (24)\nTax on exceptional items and other adjustments 44 1 45 3\nExceptional tax items8 — (8) — (8)\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments (167) (17) (171) (29)\n1. The Group reported adjusted cost of sales to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n2. In H1 2024 and Q2 2024, the Group recognized $41m of exceptional costs related to the discontinuation of sales and marketing for\nPERSERIS.\n3. In H1 and Q2 2024, the Group recognized exceptional costs of $85m related to the July 8, 2024 settlement of certain antitrust legal\nmatters and $75m related to the Opioid MDL (refer to Notes 11 and 13).\n4. In H1 2024 and Q2 2024, the Group recognized $4m and $2m, respectively, of exceptional costs related to the acquisition and\nintegration of the aseptic manufacturing site acquired in November 2023 (refer to note 17).

The Group recognized exceptional costs related to listing Indivior shares on NASDAQ as the primary listing of $4m In H1 2024 and Q2\n2024 (H1 2023: $6m and Q2 2023: $4m).\n6.

The underlying demand for this transformative treatment for moderate-to-severe opioid use\ndisorder (OUD) remains strong and our strategy to expand prescribing in the justice system is delivering excellent\nresults. SUBLOCADE’s reported growth was, however, adversely impacted by transitory items, including\naccelerating Medicaid patient disenrollments, a cyberattack on the largest U.S. medical claims processor and\nabnormal trade destocking. We fully expect these items to resolve as the year progresses and, combined with the\nbenefits of recent commercial investments behind SUBLOCADE, we anticipate an acceleration in our top- and\nbottom-line growth over the remainder of 2024, particularly in the second half. We therefore reconfirm our 2024\nguidance, including SUBLOCADE net revenue of $820m to $880m and approximately 300 basis points of margin\nexpansion at the mid-points of our guidance range.\nLastly, after receiving strong indications of support from our shareholders, we are confirming our intention to seek\nshareholder approval in May 2024 to facilitate a primary listing in the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in\nthe U.K.\"\nQuarter to March 31 (Unaudited) 2024 2023 % Change\n$m $m\nNet Revenue 284 253 12%\nOperating Profit 65 57 14%\nNet Income 47 44 7%\nDiluted EPS ($) $0.34 $0.31 10%\nAdjusted Basis\nAdj.

Adjusted results are not a substitute for, or superior to, reported results presented in accordance with International\nFinancial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\").\nThe \"Company\" refers to Indivior PLC and the \"Group\" refers to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nQ1 2024 Financial Highlights\n• Q1 2024 total net revenue (NR) of $284m increased 12% (Q1 2023: $253m).\n• Q1 2024 reported operating profit was $65m (Q1 2023: $57m). Q1 2024 adjusted operating profit of $70m\nrepresented a decrease of 1% (Adjusted Q1 2023: $71m).\n• Q1 2024 reported net income was $47m (Q1 2023: $44m). Q1 2024 adjusted net income of $51m represented\na decrease of 9% (Adjusted Q1 2023: $56m).\n• Cash and investments totaled $356m at the end of Q1 2024 (including $27m restricted for self-insurance) (FY\n2023: $451m), primarily reflecting the Q1 2024 net cash outflows related to scheduled litigation settlement\npayments, shares repurchased and canceled, and taxes paid.\n1\nQ1 2024 Product Highlights\n• SUBLOCADE: Q1 2024 NR of $179m (+36% vs. Q1 2023; +2% vs. Q4 2023). Continued growth primarily reflects\nfurther organized health system (OHS) and justice system channel penetration in the U.S. and increased new\nU.S. patient enrollments. Q1 2024 U.S. units dispensed were approx. 148,600 (+38% vs. Q1 2023 and +4% vs.\nQ4 2023). Total U.S. patients on a 12-month rolling basis at the end of Q1 2024 were approximately 150,300\n(+59% vs. Q1 2023 and +10% vs. Q4 2023).\n• OPVEE®: Q1 2024 NR was modest (under $1m), as expected; near-term launch focus is on supporting\nfoundational policy changes to enable nalmefene opioid rescue treatments.\n• PERSERIS®: Q1 2024 NR of $11m (+38% vs. Q1 2023; -8% vs. Q4 2023) reflects increasing awareness of the\ntreatment across the U.S. healthcare system versus last year.\n• SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine/naloxone) Film: U.S. share in Q1 2024 averaged 17% (Q1 2023: 19%).\nFY 2024 Guidance\nThe Group reconfirms its financial guidance for 2024, as set forth in its press release dated February 22, 2024.\nPursuing Shareholder Approval for a Primary Listing in the U.S. in the Summer of 2024\nOn February 22, 2024, Indivior announced the commencement of shareholder consultations to effect a primary\nlisting in the U.S. in the summer of 2024. The Group believes a primary U.S. listing could be beneficial to Indivior\nstakeholders as it would better align with the Group's current and future growth opportunities, attract more U.S.\ninvestors and analysts, allow for inclusion in U.S. indices over time and better reflect the growing proportion of the\nGroup's share capital owned by U.S. based investors.\nSince the February 22, 2024 announcement, the Group has consulted extensively with shareholders and, together\nwith its advisers, has carefully considered the shareholder feedback received. Having largely completed this\nconsultation process, the Board confirms its intention to seek shareholder approval in May 2024 to facilitate a shift\nto a primary listing in the U.S., which would be expected to take place in the summer of 2024.\nThe Board intends to maintain Indivior's U.K. listing as a secondary listing following the transition to a primary U.S.\nlisting.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn November 17, 2023, Indivior announced a third share repurchase program of up to $100m. Through April 19,\n2024, the Group repurchased and canceled 3,761,052 Indivior ordinary shares, equivalent to approximately 3% of\ndiluted shares outstanding, at a daily weighted average purchase price of 1,373p. The cost was approximately\n$66m, which includes directly attributable transaction costs. The program is expected to conclude no later than\nAugust 30, 2024. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion.\nU.S. OUD Market Update\nIn Q1 2024, U.S. buprenorphine medication-assisted treatments (BMAT) grew in mid-single digits in volume terms.\nThe Group continues to expect long-term U.S. growth to be sustained in the mid- to high-single digit percentage\nrange due to increased overall public awareness of the opioid epidemic and approved treatments, together with\nregulatory and legislative actions, such as the late 2022 enactment of the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act,\nthat have expanded OUD treatment funding and treatment capacity. The Group believes these regulatory and\nlegislative actions will help to normalize the view of addiction as a chronic disease and expand access to evidence-\nbased buprenorphine treatment in the U.S. and supports these actions.\nFinancial Performance in Q1 2024\nTotal net revenue in Q1 2024 increased 12% to $284m (Q1 2023: $253m) at actual exchange rates (+12% at\nconstant exchange rates1).\nU.S. net revenue increased 15% in Q1 2024 to $241m (Q1 2023: $209m). Strong year-over-year SUBLOCADE\nvolume growth primarily drove the net revenue increase. Pricing was not a material factor in revenue growth.\nRest of World (ROW) net revenue decreased 2% at actual exchange rates in Q1 2024 to $43m (Q1 2023: $44m)\n(-2% at constant exchange rates1). In the period, positive contributions from new products (SUBLOCADE /\nSUBUTEX® Prolonged Release and SUBOXONE Film) were more than offset primarily by the timing of shipments of\ncertain products as well as ongoing generic erosion of the legacy tablet business. Q1 2024 SUBLOCADE / SUBUTEX\nProlonged Release net revenue in ROW was $12m (Q1 2023: $9m) at actual exchange rates.\n1 Net revenue at constant exchange rates is an alternative performance measure used by management to evaluate underlying performance of\nthe business and is calculated by applying the prior year exchange rate to net revenue in the currencies of the foreign entities.\n2\nGross margin as reported in Q1 2024 was 84% (Q1 2023: 85%). Excluding $3m of other adjustments for\namortization of acquired intangible assets within cost of sales primarily related to the acquisition of Opiant,\nadjusted gross margin in Q1 2024 was 85%. There were no adjustments to Q1 2023 gross margin. The adjusted\ngross margin in Q1 2024 primarily reflects an improved product mix from the continued growth of SUBLOCADE\noffset by cost inflation. Additionally, both periods benefited from favorable manufacturing variances.\nSG&A expenses as reported in Q1 2024 were $145m (Q1 2023: $131m). Q1 2024 included $2m of exceptional\nintegration costs related to the aseptic manufacturing site in Raleigh, NC acquired in November 2023. The Group\nexpects to incur approximately $3m in additional pre-tax integration related costs in FY 2024 which would be\nrecorded as exceptional. Q1 2023 included $14m of exceptional items related to non-recurring costs associated\nwith the acquisition of Opiant ($12m) and the additional U.S. listing ($2m).\nExcluding exceptional items, Q1 2024 adjusted SG&A expense increased 22% to $143m (Adjusted Q1 2023:\n$117m). The increase in Q1 2024 reflects increased sales and marketing investments primarily related to\nSUBLOCADE, the addition of the Opiant business, OPVEE launch expenses and cost inflation.\nR&D expenses in Q1 2024 were $28m (Q1 2023: $27m), an increase of 4%. The increase was primarily due to the\nprogression of pipeline assets partially offset by a reduction in activity related to post-marketing studies for\nSUBLOCADE.\nNet other operating income in Q1 2024 was nil (Q1 2023: $1m).\nOperating profit as reported was $65m in Q1 2024 (Q1 2023: $57m). The change on a reported basis reflects\nhigher NR and gross margin as described above, offset by investments in sales and marketing primarily related to\nSUBLOCADE. The Q1 2023 period included exceptional administrative costs relating to the Opiant acquisition.\nQ1 2024 adjusted operating profit decreased 1% to $70m (Q1 2023: $71m), excluding exceptional items and other\nadjustments of $5m and $14m in Q1 2024 and Q1 2023, respectively. The decrease primarily reflects increased\nSG&A expenses, as described above, partly offset by higher total NR and gross margin from an improved product\nmix.\nNet finance expense was $2m in Q1 2024 (Q1 2023: $1m income) reflecting a decrease in interest income on lower\ncash and investment balances.\nReported tax expense was $16m in Q1 2024 and the effective tax rate was 25% (Q1 2023 tax expense/rate: $14m,\n24%). Q1 2024 adjusted tax expense was $17m, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 25% (Q1 2023 adjusted tax\nexpense/rate: $16m, 22%). The adjusted results exclude tax benefit on exceptional items and other adjustments.\nThe movement in the effective tax rate on adjusted profits is impacted by an increase in the U.K. corporation tax\nrate from 23.5% to 25%.\nReported net income in Q1 2024 was $47m and adjusted net income was $51m (Q1 2023 reported net income:\n$44m; Q1 2023 adjusted net income: $56m). The 9% decrease in net income on an adjusted basis primarily\nreflected the increase in operating expense, partly offset by higher total NR.\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.34 on a reported basis and $0.37 on an adjusted basis in Q1 2024 (Q1 2023:\n$0.31 diluted earnings per share and $0.40 adjusted diluted earnings per share).\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\nCash and investments totaled $356m at the end of Q1 2024, a decrease of $95m versus the $451m position at the\nend of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the Group's litigation settlement payments of $70m for the\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ), Reckitt Benckiser (RB) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) matters.\nNet working capital, defined by management as inventory plus trade receivables, less trade and other payables,\nwas negative $342m on March 31, 2024, versus negative $347m at the end of FY 2023.\nCash used in operations in Q1 2024 was $25m (Q1 2023 cash used in operations: $16m), primarily due to litigation\nsettlement payments, partially offset by income from operations. Before these litigation settlement payments,\ncash generated from operations in the current period was $45m. Net cash outflow from operating activities was\n$55m in Q1 2024 (Q1 2023 cash outflow: $36m) reflecting tax payments and interest paid on the Group's term loan\nfacility and settlement payments, partially offset by interest received on investments.\nCash inflow from investing activities was $25m (Q1 2023 cash outflow: $127m) reflecting the reduction in\ninvested liquidity. In the prior year period, the outflow from investing activities primarily reflected the Opiant\nacquisition, net of cash assumed.\n3\nCash outflow from financing activities was $38m (Q1 2023 cash outflow: $22m) reflecting shares repurchased and\ncanceled, the principal portion of lease payments and quarterly amortization of the Group’s term loan facility,\npartially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of shares for employee compensation agreements. In the\nprior year period, the outflow from financing activities primarily reflected shares repurchased and canceled and\nthe extinguishment of debt assumed in the Opiant acquisition.\nPrincipal Risks Update\nThe Board of Directors oversees the approach to risk management so that the principal risks, including those that\nwould threaten the Group’s business model, future performance or viability, are effectively managed and/or\nmitigated. While the Group aims to identify and manage such risks, no risk management strategy can provide\nabsolute assurance against loss. The principal risks facing the Group have not significantly changed over the period\nand are set out in the Group’s Annual Report for the 2023 financial year.\nExchange Rates\nThe average and period end exchange rates used for the translation of currencies into U.S. dollars that have most\nsignificant impact on the Group’s results were:\nQ1 2024 Q1 2023\nGB £ period end 1.2627 1.2309\nGB £ average rate 1.2683 1.2149\n€ Euro period end 1.0830 1.0828\n€ Euro average 1.0859 1.0726\nWebcast Details\nA live webcast presentation will be held on April 25, 2024, at 13:00 GMT (8:00 am EDT) hosted by Mark Crossley,\nCEO.

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nIndivior PLC (the 'Company') is a public limited company incorporated on September 26, 2014 and domiciled in the United\nKingdom. In these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (‘Condensed Financial Statements’), reference\nto the ‘Group’ means the Company and all its subsidiaries.\nThe Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.K. adopted International Accounting\nStandard 34, Interim Financial Reporting. The Condensed Financial Statements have been reviewed and are unaudited and\ndo not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements. Therefore, the Condensed\nFinancial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, which were prepared in accordance with U.K. adopted International Accounting Standards and in\nconformity with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. These Condensed\nFinancial Statements were approved for issue on April 24, 2024.\nIn preparing these Condensed Financial Statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the\nGroup’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for changes in estimates that are required\nin determining the provision for income taxes.\nIn 2023, the Group acquired an aseptic manufacturing facility which was accounted for as a business combination. As the\nacquisition was completed in late 2023, a provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of\nacquisition was disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. In 2024, based\non new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, the Group adjusted the\nprovisional fair values for acquired property, plant and equipment and the assumed onerous contract provision, with an\nadjustment to goodwill equal to the change in the net assets acquired. These measurement period adjustments have been\nreflected in the comparative period presented in the Condensed Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS 3 Business\nCombinations. The effect on depreciation and other changes in the related balances from the acquisition date to December\n31, 2023 was immaterial. Refer to Note 17 for a reconciliation of the previously reported provisional fair value of net assets\nacquired to the adjusted provisional fair value.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the functional currency of Indivior U.K. Limited, one of the Group’s significant subsidiaries,\nchanged from pound sterling to U.S. dollar (USD). This was the result of a change in the primary economic environment in\nwhich Indivior U.K. Limited operates, driven by growth of USD-denominated net revenue combined with an increase in\nUSD-denominated costs and culminating with a shift in investing activities to USD securities. The Group determined the\nUSD had become the dominant currency from January 2024.\nThe Directors have assessed the Group’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its operations, fulfill financial and\ncompliance obligations as set out in Note 11, and comply with the minimum liquidity covenant in the Group’s term loan for\nthe period to September 2025 (the going concern period). A base case model was produced reflecting:\n• Board reviewed financial plans for the period; and\n• settlement of liabilities and provisions in line with contractual terms.\nThe Directors also assessed a ‘severe but plausible’ downside scenario which included the following key changes to the\nbase case within the going concern period:\n• the risk that SUBLOCADE will not meet revenue growth expectations by modeling a 10% decline on forecasts;\n• an accelerated decline in U.S. SUBOXONE Film net revenue to generic analogues; and\n• a further decline in rest of world sublingual product net revenues.\nUnder both the base case and the downside scenario, sufficient liquidity exists and is generated from operations such that\nall business and covenant requirements are met for the going concern period. As a result of the analysis described above,\nthe Directors reasonably expect the Group to have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least one\nyear from the approval of these Condensed Financial Statements and therefore consider the going concern basis to be\nappropriate for the accounting and preparation of these Condensed Financial Statements.\nThe financial information contained in this document does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 and\n435 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group’s statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, were\napproved by the Board of Directors on March 5, 2024 and will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in due course.\nThe auditor's report on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not\ncontain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\n10\n2. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Group is engaged in a single business activity, which is predominantly the development, manufacture, and sale of\nbuprenorphine-based prescription drugs for treatment of opioid dependence and related disorders. The CEO reviews\ndisaggregated net revenue on a geographical and product basis and allocates resources on a functional basis between\nCommercial, Supply, Research and Development, and other Group functions. Financial results are reviewed on a\nconsolidated basis for evaluating financial performance and allocating resources. Accordingly, the Group operates in a\nsingle reportable segment.\nNet revenue\nRevenue is attributed geographically based on the country where the sale originates. The following table represents net\nrevenue by country:\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nUnited States 241 209\nRest of World 43 44\nTotal 284 253\nOn a disaggregated basis, the Group’s net revenue by major product line:\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nSUBLOCADE® 179 132\nPERSERIS® 11 8\nSublingual/other1 94 113\nTotal 284 253\n1 Net revenue for OPVEE® was not material for the period ended March 31, 2024 and has therefore been included within sublingual/other.\nNon-current assets\nThe following table represents non-current assets, net of accumulated depreciation, amortization and impairment, by\ncountry. Non-current assets for this purpose consist of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use\nassets, investments, and other assets.\nDec 31, 2023\nMar 31, (Retrospectively\n2024 adjusted1)\n$m $m\nUnited States 206 209\nRest of World 191 209\nTotal 397 418\n1 The non-current asset balance in the United States as of December 31, 2023 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect measurement\nperiod adjustments of $2m to property, plant and equipment and $3m to intangible assets related to the November 2023 acquisition of an\naseptic manufacturing facility. Refer to Note 17.\n3. OPERATING EXPENSES\nThe table below sets out selected operating costs and expense information:\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nResearch and development expenses (28) (27)\nSelling and marketing expenses (66) (53)\nAdministrative and general expenses1 (79) (78)\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses (145) (131)\nDepreciation and amortization2 (3) (4)\n1 Administrative and general expenses include acquisition-related costs of $12m in Q1 2023 related to the acquisition of Opiant\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Opiant\"). Refer to Note 16.\n2 Depreciation and amortization expense represents amounts included in research and development and selling, general and\nadministrative expenses. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense in Q1 2024 of $6m (Q1 2023: $2m) for intangible assets and\nright-of-use assets is included within cost of sales.\n11\n4.

TAXATION\nThe Group calculates tax expense for interim periods using the expected full year rates, considering the pre-tax income and\nstatutory rates for each jurisdiction. To the extent practicable, a separate estimated average annual effective income tax\nrate is determined for each taxing jurisdiction and applied individually to the interim period pre-tax income of each\njurisdiction. Similarly, if different income tax rates apply to different categories of income (such as capital gains or income\nearned in particular industries), to the extent practicable a separate rate is applied to each individual category of interim\nperiod pre-tax income. The resulting expense is allocated between current and deferred taxes based on actual movement\nin deferred tax for the quarter, with the balance recorded to the current tax accounts.\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nTotal tax expense (16) (14)\nEffective tax rate (%) 25 % 24 %\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2024, the effective tax rate was primarily driven by statutory tax. In the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023, the effective tax rate was primarily driven by an increase in the U.K. tax rate from 19% to\n23.5%, and the temporary reduction in innovation incentives due to 2022 losses.\nDec 31, 2023\nMar 31, (Retrospectively\n2024 adjusted1)\n$m $m\nCurrent tax receivable 9 —\nCurrent tax liabilities (7) (18)\nDeferred tax assets 260 267\n1 The deferred tax assets balance as of December 31, 2023 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect a measurement period adjustment\nrelated to the November 2023 acquisition of an aseptic manufacturing facility. Refer to Note 17.\nThe Group recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that sufficient future taxable profits are probable against which\nthese future tax deductions can be utilized. At March 31, 2024, the Group’s net deferred tax assets of $260m relate\nprimarily to net operating loss carryforwards, inventory costs capitalized for tax purposes, and litigation liabilities.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is reliant on forecast taxable profits arising in the jurisdiction in which the deferred tax\nasset is recognized. The Group has assessed recoverability of deferred tax assets using Group-level budgets and forecasts\nconsistent with those used for the assessment of viability and asset impairments, particularly in relation to levels of future\nnet revenues. These forecasts are subject to similar uncertainties to those assessments. This is reviewed each quarter and,\nto the extent required, an adjustment to the recognized deferred tax asset may be made. With the exception of specific\nassets that are not currently considered realizable, management have concluded full recognition of deferred tax assets to\nbe appropriate and do not believe a significant risk of material change in their assessment exists in the next 12 months\nfrom the balance sheet date.\nOther tax matters\nThe Group is subject to Pillar Two legislation effective January 1, 2024. As such, the Group performed an assessment of the\npotential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes including modeling of adjusted accounting data for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and a review of forecasts for the year ended December 31, 2024. Based on the assessment, the Group\ndid not record any current tax liability related to Pillar Two. The Group has applied the recent amendment to IAS 12 which\nprovides temporary relief to the recognition of deferred taxes relating to top-up income taxes.\n12\nAs a multinational group, tax uncertainties remain in relation to Group financing, intercompany pricing, the location of\ntaxable operations, and certain non-recurring costs. Management have concluded tax provisions made to be appropriate\nand do not believe a significant risk of material change to uncertain tax positions exists in the next 12 months from the\nbalance sheet date. Including matters under audit, an estimate of reasonably possible additional tax liabilities that could\narise in later periods on resolution of these uncertainties is in the range from nil to $38m.\n6.

INVESTMENTS\nMar 31, Dec 31,\n2024 2023\nCurrent and non-current investments $m $m\nEquity securities at FVPL 10 10\nDebt securities held at amortized cost 72 84\nTotal investments, current 82 94\nDebt securities held at amortized cost 26 41\nTotal investments, non-current 26 41\nTotal 108 135\nThe Group’s investments in debt and equity securities do not create significant credit risk, liquidity risk, or interest rate risk.\nDebt securities held at amortized cost consist of investment-grade debt. As of March 31, 2024, expected credit losses for\nthe Group’s investments held at amortized cost are deemed to be immaterial.\nFair value hierarchy\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability\n13\nThe Group’s only financial instruments which are measured at fair value are equity securities at FVPL. The fair value of\nequity securities at FVPL is based on quoted market prices on the measurement date. The following table categorizes the\nGroup’s financial assets measured at fair value by valuation methodology used in determining their fair value:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAt March 31, 2024 $m $m $m $m\nEquity securities at FVPL 10 — — 10\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAt December 31, 2023 $m $m $m $m\nEquity securities at FVPL 10 — — 10\nThe Group also has certain financial instruments which are not measured at fair value. The carrying value of cash and cash\nequivalents, trade receivables, other assets, and trade and other payables is assumed to approximate fair value due to\ntheir short-term nature. At March 31, 2024, the carrying value of investments held at amortized cost approximated the fair\nvalue. The fair value of investments held at amortized cost was calculated based on quoted market prices which would be\nclassified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy above.\n9. CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT OTHER ASSETS\nMar 31, Dec 31,\n2024 2023\nCurrent and non-current other assets $m $m\nCurrent prepaid expenses 31 23\nOther current assets 14 434\nTotal other current assets 45 457\nNon-current prepaid expenses 18 19\nOther non-current assets 11 9\nTotal other non-current assets 29 28\nTotal 74 485\nThe decrease in other current assets primarily relates to release of escrow funding of $415m for the Antitrust MDL (direct\npurchaser and end payor class settlements) since the courts have provided final approval of the settlements. Refer to Note\n13. Long-term prepaid expenses primarily relate to payments for contract manufacturing capacity.\n10. FINANCIAL LIABILITIES – BORROWINGS\nThe table below sets out the current and non-current portion obligation of the Group’s term loan:\nMar 31, Dec 31,\n2024 2023\nTerm loan $m $m\nTerm loan – current (3) (3)\nTerm loan – non-current (235) (236)\nTotal term loan (238) (239)\n*Total term loan borrowings reflect the principal amount drawn including debt issuance costs of $5m (FY 2023: $5m).\nAt March 31, 2024, the term loan fair value was approximately 100% (FY 2023: 100%) of par value. The key terms of this\nloan in effect at March 31, 2024, are as follows:\nRequired\nannual Minimum\nCurrency Nominal interest margin Maturity repayments liquidity\nTerm loan facility USD SOFR + 0.26% + 5.25% 2026 1% Larger of $100m or 50% of loan balance\nThe term loan amounting to $243m (FY 2023: $244m) is secured against the assets of certain subsidiaries of the Group in\nthe form of guarantees issued by respective subsidiaries.\n• Nominal interest margin is calculated as USD SOFR plus 26 bps, subject to a floor of 0.75%, plus a credit spread\nadjustment of 5.25%.\n• There are no revolving credit commitments.\n14\n11.

Refer to Note 17.\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims\nAs previously disclosed, settlement agreements were entered into during 2023 with three plaintiff classes to fully resolve\ncertain multi-district antitrust claims. The $385m direct purchaser class settlement received final court approval during the\nquarter. The provision and related other escrow settlement asset have been offset and Indivior has no further obligations\nrelated to this matter.\nOnerous contracts\nIn November 2023, the Group acquired a business consisting of a manufacturing facility, workforce, and supply contracts.\nThe facility is obligated to fulfill contracts that existed pre-acquisition for which the expected costs are in excess of the\nconsideration expected to be received. The Group recorded a provision for these onerous contracts in the allocation of\npurchase price, with a balance at the end of the quarter of $17m (FY 2023: $22m). During the quarter, net operating losses\nattributable to the contracts of $6m were recorded against the provision. A measurement period adjustment to this\nprovision as of the acquisition date was recorded during the quarter and the reported December 31, 2023 provision has\nbeen adjusted accordingly. Refer to Note 17, Business Combination for additional details on this measurement period\nadjustment. Product manufacturing under the onerous contracts is expected to be completed prior to March 2025 and the\nprovision is recorded at its discounted value, using a market rate at the time of the transaction determined to be 7.6%.\nFalse Claims Act allegations\nThe Group carries a provision of $4m (FY 2023: $4m) pertaining to all outstanding False Claims Act allegations as discussed\nin Note 13. These matters are expected to be settled within the next 12 months.\nOther\nOther provisions of $2m (FY 2023: $2m) represent retirement benefit costs which are not expected to be settled within one\nyear.\nOther liabilities\nTotal Total\nNon- Mar 31, Non- Dec 31,\nCurrent Current 2024 Current Current 2023\nCurrent and non-current other liabilities $m $m $m $m $m $m\nDOJ resolution (50) (295) (345) (53) (344) (397)\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims — — — (30) — (30)\nIntellectual property related matters — — — (11) — (11)\nRB indemnity settlement (8) (7) (15) (8) (15) (23)\nShare repurchase (9) — (9) (23) — (23)\nOther — (11) (11) — (8) (8)\nTotal other liabilities (67) (313) (380) (125) (367) (492)\n15\nDOJ Resolution Agreement\nIn July 2020, the Group settled criminal and civil liability with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), and U.S. state attorneys general. Pursuant to the resolution agreement, aggregate\npayments of $263m (including interest) have been made through March 31, 2024, including a payment of $53m in January\n2024. Annual installments of $50m plus interest are due every January 15 from 2025 to 2027, with the final installment of\n$200m due in December 2027. The Group has the option to prepay. Interest accrues at 1.25% on certain portions of the\nresolution and will be paid with the annual installment payments. For non-interest-bearing portions, the liability has been\nrecorded at the net present value based on timing of the estimated payments using a discount rate equal to the interest\nrate on the interest-bearing portions. In Q1 2024, the Group recorded interest expense totaling $1m (Q1 2023: $1m).\nMulti-district antitrust class and state claims\nAs noted above, certain multi-district antitrust claims were resolved during 2023 through settlement agreements entered\ninto with three classes of plaintiffs. The $30m end payor liability and related other escrow settlement asset have been\noffset since final court approval was received and Indivior has no further obligations related to this matter.\nIP related matters\nOther liabilities for intellectual property related matters relate to the settlement of litigation with DRL in June 2022. Under\nthe settlement agreement, the Group made a final payment to DRL of $12m during the quarter and has no further\nobligations related to this matter.\nRB indemnity settlement\nUnder the RB indemnity settlement, the Group has paid $34m of the $50m settlement agreement through March 31, 2024\nincluding $8m paid in January 2024. Remaining annual installment payments of $8m are due in January 2025 and 2026. The\nGroup carries a liability totaling $15m (FY 2023: $23m) related to this settlement. This liability has been recorded at the net\npresent value, using a market interest rate at the time of the settlement determined to be 3.75%, considering the timing of\npayments and other factors. In Q1 2024, the Group recorded nil of finance expense (Q1 2023: nil) for time value of money\non the liability.\nShare repurchase\nIn November 2023, the Group commenced a share repurchase program of $100m. As of March 31, 2024, the liability of\n$9m represents the amount to be spent under the program through April 26, 2024, after which date the Company has the\nability to modify or terminate the program. As of December 31, 2023, the current liability of $23m represented the amount\nto be spent under the program through February 23, 2024.\nOther\nOther liabilities primarily represent employee related liabilities which are non-current as of March 31, 2024.\n12. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nThe Group has assessed certain legal and other matters to be not probable based upon current facts and circumstances,\nincluding any potential impact the DOJ resolution could have on these matters. Where liabilities related to these matters\nare determined to be possible, they represent contingent liabilities. Except for those matters discussed in Note 13 under\n“False Claims Act allegations”, for which provisions have been recognized, Note 13 sets out the details for legal and other\ndisputes for which the Group has assessed as contingent liabilities. Where the Group believes that it is possible to\nreasonably estimate a range for the contingent liability this has been disclosed.\n13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThere are certain ongoing legal proceedings or threats of legal proceedings in which the Group is a party, but in which the\nGroup believes the possibility of an adverse impact is remote and they are not discussed in this Note.\nAntitrust Litigation and Consumer Protection\n• Cases filed by (1) Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc., Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts HMO\nBlue, Inc., (2) Health Care Service Corp., (3) Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, Inc., Health Options, Inc., (4) BCBSM,\nInc. (d/b/a Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota) and HMO Minnesota (d/b/a Blue Plus), (5) Molina Healthcare,\nInc., and (6) Aetna Inc. were filed in the Circuit Court for the County of Roanoke, Virginia. See Health Care Services\nCorp. v. Indivior Inc., No. CL20-1474 (Lead Case) (Va. Cir. Ct.) (Roanoke Cnty). In July 2023, Indivior Inc. and BCBSM,\nInc. and HMO Minnesota agreed to mutual releases and settlement. The remaining plaintiffs asserted claims under\nfederal and state RICO statutes, state antitrust statutes, state statutes prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices, state\nstatutes prohibiting insurance fraud, and common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. The\nGroup filed demurrers, which the court sustained in part and overruled in part. Separately, Indivior Inc. filed\ncounterclaims against several plaintiffs alleging violations of certain insurance fraud statutes. The plaintiffs demurred.\nThe court overruled HCSC's demurrer but sustained the demurrers of the remaining plaintiffs named in Indivior Inc.'s\ncounterclaims. A jury trial on the Group's pleas in bar to the remaining plaintiffs' fraud claims was held on October 30\n— November 3, 2023. The jury rendered a verdict finding that the plaintiffs' fraud claims are not barred by the statute\nof limitations. A jury trial on the merits has been set for July 15, 2024 – August 15, 2024. The Group is still in the\n16\nprocess of evaluating the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to defend itself. No estimate of the\nrange of potential loss can be made at this time.\n• Humana, Inc. filed a Complaint in state court in Kentucky on August 20, 2021 with claims substantially similar to those\nasserted by other end payors in the HCSC consolidated litigation. See Humana Inc. v. Indivior Inc., No. 21-CI-004833\n(Ky. Cir. Ct.) (Jefferson Cnty). The court lifted a stay on October 30, 2023. Indivior moved to dismiss the complaint in\nFebruary 2024. The Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to\nvigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be\nmade at this time.\n• Centene Corporation, Wellcare Healthcare Plans, Inc., New York Quality Healthcare Corp. (d/b/a Fidelis Care), and\nHealth Net, LLC filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for the County of Roanoke, Virginia alleging similar claims on\nJanuary 13, 2023. See Centene Corp. v. Indivior Inc., No. CL23000054-00 (Va. Cir. Ct.) (Roanoke Cnty). Indivior\ndemurred to the complaint and asserted pleas in bar in early February 2024. The Group has begun its evaluation of\nthe claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status and\npreliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\n• As previously disclosed in 2023, Indivior Inc. settled claims of all plaintiff groups in the company's antitrust multi-\ndistrict litigation (\"Antitrust MDL\") namely, (i) 41 states and the District of Columbia (the \"States\"), (ii) end payors, and\n(iii) direct purchasers (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\"). Indivior Inc. reached a settlement with the States for $103m on\nJune 1, 2023. Indivior Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the end payor class for $30m on August 14, 2023\nand received final court approval on December 5, 2023. On October 22, 2023, Indivior Inc. entered into a settlement\nagreement with the remaining direct purchaser class for $385m, which received final court approval on February 27,\n2024.\n• In 2013, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc. \"RBPI,\" now known as Indivior Inc. received notice that it and other\ncompanies were defendants in a lawsuit initiated by writ in the Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) Court of Common\nPleas. See Carefirst of Maryland, Inc. et al. v. Reckitt Benckiser Inc., et al., Case. No. 2875, December Term 2013. The\nplaintiffs included approximately 79 entities, most of which appeared to be insurance companies or other providers of\nhealth benefits plans. The claims of all plaintiffs in the Carefirst action except Humana Inc. and certain of its affiliates\nwere resolved in connection with final approval of the end payor settlement in the Antitrust MDL, and accordingly\ndismissed on February 14, 2024. The claims of Humana Inc. and certain of its affiliates in the Carefirst action remain\npending. The Group has begun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to\nvigorously defend itself. Given the status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be\nmade at this time.\nCivil Opioid Litigation\n• The Group has been named as a defendant in more than 400 civil lawsuits alleging that manufacturers, distributors,\nand retailers of opioids engaged in a longstanding practice to market opioids as safe and effective for the treatment of\nlong-term chronic pain to increase the market for opioids and their own market shares for opioids, or alleging\nindividual personal injury claims. Most of these cases have been consolidated and are pending in a federal multi-\ndistrict litigation (\"the Opioid MDL\") in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. See In re National\nPrescription Opiate Litigation, MDL No. 2804 (N.D. Ohio). Nearly two-thirds of the cases in the Opioid MDL were filed\nby cities and counties, while nearly one-third of the cases were filed by individual plaintiffs, most of whom assert\nclaims relating to neonatal abstinence syndrome (\"NAS\"). Litigation against the Group in the Opioid MDL is stayed.\n• The court in the Opioid MDL has indicated that it does not intend to set additional bellwether trials for Tier 2 and Tier\n3 manufacturer and distributor defendants, provided that those defendants remain actively engaged in mediation.\n• Separately, Indivior Inc. was named as one of numerous defendants in civil opioid cases that are not part of the Opioid\nMDL:\n◦ In 2017, Indivior Inc. was named as one of numerous defendants in International Brotherhood of Electrical\nWorkers Local 728 Family Healthcare Plan v. Allergan, PLC et al., Case ID: 190303872 (C.P. Phila. Cnty). That case\nwas consolidated with Lead Case No. 2017-008095 in Delaware County and stayed, remanded back to the\nPhiladelphia Court by order dated December 29, 2023, and ultimately dismissed with prejudice as to Indivior Inc.\nby agreement of the parties on March 27, 2024.\n◦ Indivior also was named as one of numerous defendants in various other federal and state court cases that are\nnot in the Opioid MDL and were brought by municipalities. These cases include, for example, 35 actions filed in\nNew York state court that were removed to federal court, as well as cases filed in federal district courts sitting in\nAlabama, Florida, Georgia, and New Mexico. The plaintiffs filed motions to remand the New York cases, which\nremain pending. The plaintiffs in the case filed in the Northern District of Alabama have voluntarily dismissed\ntheir complaint, subject to certain tolling agreements. The various other federal actions currently are stayed,\nexcept Indivior's response to the complaint in San Miguel Hospital Corp. d/b/a Alta Vista Regional Medical Center\nv. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. 1:23-cv-00903 (D.N.M.) is due May 2, 2024.\n◦ Indivior Inc. was named as a defendant in five individual complaints filed in West Virginia state court that were\ntransferred to West Virginia's Mass Litigation Panel. See In re Opioid Litigation, No. 22-C-9000 NAS (W.V.\nKanawha Cnty. Cir. Ct.) (\"WV MLP Action\"). All five of Indivior Inc.'s cases in the WV MLP Action involved claims\nrelated to NAS. Indivior Inc. moved to dismiss all five complaints on January 30, 2023. By order dated April 17,\n17\n2023, the court granted Indivior's motions to dismiss. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on June 30, 2023.\nAppellate briefing in various cases, including the cases involving Indivior, was stayed in view of Rite-Aid's\nbankruptcy. However, on April 16, 2024, the court of appeals granted the plaintiffs' motion to sever Rite-Aid and\nlift the stay. Plaintiffs have until May 7, 2024 to perfect their appeal, and the Defendants' response is due by June\n21, 2024.\n• Given the status and preliminary stage of litigation in both the Opioid MDL and the separate federal and state court\nactions, no estimate of possible loss in the opioid litigation can be made at this time.\nFalse Claims Act Allegations\n• In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia unsealed a declined qui tam\ncomplaint alleging causes of action under the Federal and state False Claims Acts against certain entities within the\nGroup predicated on best price issues and claims of retaliation. See United States ex rel. Miller v. Reckitt Benckiser\nGroup PLC et al., Case No. 1:15-cv-00017 (W.D. Va.). The suit also seeks reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The\nGroup filed a Motion to Dismiss in June 2021, which was granted in part and denied in part on October 17, 2023. The\nrelator filed a sixth amended complaint against only Indivior Inc. on December 7, 2023. Indivior answered the sixth\namended complaint on March 18, 2024.\n• In May 2018, Indivior Inc. received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office (“USAO”) for the\nSouthern District of New York, seeking records relating to the SUBOXONE Film manufacturing process. The Group\nprovided the USAO certain information regarding allegations that the government received regarding SUBOXONE\nFilm. There has been no communication regarding this matter with the USAO since 2022.\nU.K. Shareholder Claims\n• On September 21, 2022, certain shareholders issued representative and multiparty claims against Indivior PLC in the\nHigh Court of Justice for the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, King’s Bench Division. On January 16,\n2023, the representative served its Particular of Claims setting forth in more detail the claims against the Group, while\nthe same law firm that represents the representative also sent its draft Particular of Claims for the multiparty action.\nThe claims made in both the representative and multiparty actions generally allege that Indivior PLC violated the U.K.\nFinancial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA 2000”) by making false or misleading statements or material\nomissions in public disclosures, including the 2014 Demerger Prospectus, regarding an alleged product-hopping\nscheme regarding the switch from SUBOXONE Tablets to SUBOXONE Film. Indivior PLC filed an application to strike\nout the representative action. On December 5, 2023, the court handed down a judgment allowing the Group's\napplication to strike out the representative action. The court subsequently awarded certain costs to the Group. On\nJanuary 23, 2024, the claimants requested permission to appeal the decision to the court of appeals. The Group has\nbegun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given\nthe status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\nDental Allegations\n• The Group has been named as a defendant in more than 325 lawsuits that have been consolidated into a multi-district\nlitigation in the Northern District of Ohio (\"Dental MDL\"). See In Re Suboxone (Buprenorphine/Naloxone) Film Products\nLiability Litigation, MDL No. 3092 (N.D. Oh.). The plaintiffs generally allege that the Group failed to properly warn\nphysicians of the risk of dental injury, and further allege that SUBOXONE products were defectively designed. The\nplaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages, as well as punitive damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. Product\nliability cases such as these typically involve issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those\nwarnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters. These cases are in their\npreliminary stages. The Group is evaluating the claims and its defenses, believes it has meritorious defenses, and\nintends to defend itself. No estimate of the range of potential loss can be made at this time. These lawsuits follow a\nJune 2022 required revision to the Prescribing Information and Patient Medication Guide about dental problems\nreported in connection with buprenorphine medicines dissolved in the mouth to treat opioid use disorder. This\nrevision was required by the FDA of all manufacturers of these products. The Group has been informed by its primary\ninsurance carrier that defense costs for the Dental MDL should begin to be reimbursed now that the Group's self-\ninsurance retention has been exhausted. To date, no such reimbursement has occurred. Additionally, the Group's\ninsurance carrier has issued a reservation of rights against payment of any finding of liability costs. The Group has\nbegun its evaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given\nthe status and preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\n• Applications to file class actions based on similar allegations as in the Dental MDL were filed in Quebec and British\nColumbia against various subsidiaries of the Group, among other defendants, in April 2024. The Group has begun its\nevaluation of the claims, believes it has meritorious defenses, and intends to vigorously defend itself. Given the status\nand preliminary stage of the litigation, no estimate of possible loss can be made at this time.\n18\n14.

In Q1 2024, net settlement of tax on employee equity awards was $20m (Q1 2023: $21m).\nShares repurchased and canceled\nOn May 3, 2022, the Group commenced a share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price up to no more than\n$100m or 39,699k of ordinary shares, (equivalent shares post share consolidation: 7,940k) which concluded on February\n28, 2023. During the prior period, the Company repurchased and canceled 484k ordinary shares with a nominal value of\n$0.50 each.\nOn November 17, 2023, the Group commenced a share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price up to no more\nthan $100m or 13,632k of ordinary shares and ending no later than August 30, 2024. During the period, the Group\nrepurchased and canceled a total of 1,988k ordinary shares at $0.50 per share under this program for an aggregate\nnominal value of $1m.\nAll ordinary shares repurchased during the period under share repurchase programs were canceled resulting in a transfer\nof the aggregate nominal value to a capital redemption reserve. The total cost of the purchases made under the share\nrepurchase program during the period, including directly attributable transaction costs, was $36m (FY 2023: $33m). A net\nrepurchase amount of $9m has been recorded as a financial liability and reduction of retained earnings which represents\nthe amount to be spent under the program through April 26, 2024, after which date the Company has the ability to modify\nor terminate the program. Total purchases under the share repurchase program will be made out of distributable profits.\n16. ACQUISITION OF OPIANT\nOn March 2, 2023, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opiant for upfront cash consideration of $146m and an\nadditional maximum amount of $8.00 per share in Contingent Value Rights (CVR) to be potentially paid upon achievement\nof net sales milestones. As a result of the acquisition, the Group added OPVEE (nalmefene nasal spray), an opioid overdose\ntreatment well-suited to confront illicit synthetic opioids like fentanyl, to its addiction science portfolio. OPVEE was\napproved by the FDA in May 2023 and launched in October 2023.\nSince substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in the OPVEE in-process research and\ndevelopment, the Group accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded an intangible asset of $126m.\n19\nThe cash outflow for the acquisition was $124m in Q1 2023, net of cash acquired, and inclusive of direct transaction costs.\nAs part of the acquisition, the Group assumed outstanding debt of $10m which was settled and included as a cash outflow\nfrom financing activities.\nAdditional acquisition-related costs of $12m were incurred in Q1 2023 and included in selling, general, and administrative\nexpenses, primarily relating to severance, acceleration of vesting of Opiant employee share compensation, and short-term\nretention accruals.\n17. BUSINESS COMBINATION\nOn November 1, 2023, the Group acquired an aseptic manufacturing facility (the \"Facility\") in the United States for upfront\nconsideration of $5m in cash and assumption of certain contract manufacturing obligations. The Facility will be further\ndeveloped to secure the long-term production and supply of SUBLOCADE and PERSERIS.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance\nwith IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value, with the excess\nof the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognized as goodwill. An onerous\ncontract provision was recorded at fair value to reflect the present value of the expected losses from assumed contractual\nmanufacturing obligations. Net operating losses attributable to these contractual obligations will be recorded against the\nonerous contract provision from the date of acquisition through fulfillment of the contracts in early 2025.\nAs of March 31, 2024, committed capital spend for the Facility is approximately $7m.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nAs the acquisition was completed in late 2023, the provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the\ndate of acquisition was disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. In 2024,\nbased on new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, the Group\nadjusted the provisional fair values for acquired property, plant and equipment and the assumed onerous contract\nprovision, with an adjustment to goodwill equal to the change in the net assets acquired. These measurement period\nadjustments have been reflected in the comparative period presented in the Condensed Financial Statements in\naccordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The following table provides a reconciliation from the provisional fair values\nof assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition as reported in the 2023 annual financial statements to\nthe provisional fair values as adjusted during the quarter:\nProvisional values\nMeasurement\nAs Previously period\nReported adjustment As adjusted\nNet assets acquired $m $m $m\nProperty, plant and equipment 28 (2) 26\nDeferred tax assets 2 (1) 1\nTrade and other payables (1) — (1)\nProvisions (29) 6 (23)\nTotal net assets acquired — 3 3\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognized as follows, reflecting the measurement period adjustments:\nProvisional values\nMeasurement\nAs Previously period\nReported adjustment As adjusted\n$m $m $m\nConsideration transferred 5 — 5\nLess: Fair value of net assets acquired — (3) (3)\nGoodwill 5 (3) 2\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to Indivior-specific synergies relating to accelerated in-sourcing of SUBLOCADE\nproduction and the skills and technical talent of the Facility's workforce.\n20\nDIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT\nThe Directors declare that, to the best of their knowledge:\n• This set of condensed consolidated interim financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance\nwith U.K. adopted International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting, gives a true and fair\nview of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of Indivior; and\n• The interim management report gives a fair review of the information in line with regulations 4.2.7 and\n4.2.8 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the\nUnited Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from\nlegislation in other jurisdictions.\nDetails of Indivior PLC’s Directors are available on our website at www.indivior.com\nBy order of the Board\nMark Crossley Ryan Preblick\nChief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer\nApril 24, 2024\n21\nIndependent review report to Indivior PLC\nReport on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements\nOur conclusion\nWe have reviewed Indivior PLC’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim financial\nstatements”) in the Q1 2024 Financial Results of Indivior PLC for the three month period ended 31 March 2024\n(the \"period\").\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial\nstatements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting\nStandard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'.\nThe interim financial statements comprise:\n• the Condensed consolidated interim balance sheet as at 31 March 2024;\n• the Condensed consolidated interim income statement and Condensed consolidated interim\nstatement of comprehensive income for the three month period then ended;\n• the Condensed consolidated interim cash flow statement for the three month period then ended;\n• the Condensed consolidated interim statement in changes in equity for the three month period then\nended; and\n• the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.\nThe interim financial statements included in the Q1 2024 Financial Results of Indivior PLC have been prepared\nin accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'.\nBasis for conclusion\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410,\n'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the\nFinancial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK) 2410”). A review of interim financial\ninformation consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting\nmatters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.\nA review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on\nAuditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all\nsignificant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nWe have read the other information contained in the Q1 2024 Financial Results and considered whether it\ncontains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial\nstatements.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the\nBasis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have\ninappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material\nuncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the\nreview procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may\ncause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.\nResponsibilities for the interim financial statements and the\nreview\nOur responsibilities and those of the directors\nThe Q1 2024 Financial Results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has been\napproved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the Q1 2024 Financial Results in\naccordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'. In preparing\nthe Q1 2024 Financial Results, including the interim financial statements, the directors are responsible for\nassessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going\nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the\ngroup or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n22\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the Q1 2024 Financial\nResults based on our review.

Exceptional items and other\nadjustments are excluded from adjusted results consistent with the internal reporting provided to management and the\nDirectors. Examples of such items could include income or restructuring and related expenses from the reconfiguration of\nthe Group’s activities and/or capital structure, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of current and non-\ncurrent assets, gains and losses from the sale of intangible assets, certain costs arising as a result of significant and non-\nrecurring regulatory and litigation matters, and certain tax related matters.\nAdjusted results are not measures defined by IFRS and are not a substitute for, or superior to, reported results presented in\naccordance with IFRS. Adjusted results as presented by the Group are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies. As a result, these performance measures should not be considered in isolation from,\nor as a substitute analysis for, the Group's reported results presented in accordance with IFRS. Management performs a\nquantitative and qualitative assessment to determine if an item should be considered for adjustment. The table below sets\nout exceptional items and other adjustments recorded in each period:\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nExceptional items and other adjustments within cost of sales\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets1 (3) —\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments within cost of sales (3) —\nExceptional items and other adjustments within SG&A\nAcquisition-related costs2 (2) (12)\nU.S. listing costs3 — (2)\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments within SG&A (2) (14)\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments before taxes (5) (14)\nTax on exceptional items and other adjustments 1 2\nTotal exceptional items and other adjustments (4) (12)\n1. The Group reported adjusted cost of sales to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n2. In Q1 2024, the Group recognized $2m of exceptional costs related to the acquisition and integration of the aseptic manufacturing\nsite acquired in November 2023. In Q1 2023, the Group recognized $12m of exceptional costs related to the acquisition of Opiant.\n3. In Q1 2023, the Group recognized $2m of exceptional costs in preparation for an additional listing of Indivior shares on a major U.S.\nexchange.\nAdjusted results\nManagement provides certain adjusted financial measures which may be useful to investors. These adjusted financial\nmeasures exclude items which do not reflect the Group's day-to-day operations and therefore may help with comparisons\nto prior periods or among companies. Management may use these financial measures to better understand trends in the\nbusiness.\nThe tables below present the adjustments between reported and adjusted results for both Q1 2024 and Q1 2023.\nReconciliation of gross profit to adjusted gross profit\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nGross profit 238 214\nExceptional items and other adjustments in cost of sales 3 —\nAdjusted gross profit 241 214\nWe define adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit divided by net revenue.\n24\nReconciliation of selling, general and administrative expenses to adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (145) (131)\nExceptional items and other adjustments in selling, general and administrative expenses 2 14\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (143) (117)\nReconciliation of operating profit to adjusted operating profit\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nOperating profit 65 57\nExceptional items and other adjustments in cost of sales 3 —\nExceptional items and other adjustments in selling, general and administrative expenses 2 14\nAdjusted operating profit 70 71\nWe define adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating profit divided by net revenue.\nReconciliation of profit before taxation to adjusted profit before taxation\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nProfit before taxation 63 58\nExceptional items and other adjustments in cost of sales 3 —\nExceptional items and other adjustments in selling, general and administrative expenses 2 14\nAdjusted profit before taxation 68 72\nReconciliation of tax expense to adjusted tax expense\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nTax expense (16) (14)\nTax on exceptional items and other adjustments (1) (2)\nAdjusted tax expense (17) (16)\nWe define adjusted effective tax rate as adjusted tax expense divided by adjusted profit before taxation.\nReconciliation of net income to adjusted net income\n2024 2023\nFor the three months ended March 31 $m $m\nNet income 47 44\nExceptional items and other adjustments in cost of sales 3 —\nExceptional items and other adjustments in selling, general and administrative expenses 2 14\nTax on exceptional items and other adjustments (1) (2)\nAdjusted net income 51 56\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\nManagement believes that diluted earnings per share, adjusted for the impact of exceptional items and other adjustments\nafter the appropriate tax amount, may provide meaningful information on underlying trends to shareholders in respect of\nearnings per ordinary share. Weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share is included in Note 6. A\nreconciliation of net income to adjusted net income is included above.\n25"

These data add to the growing body of evidence that SUBLOCADE can improve outcomes, such as abstinence, retention, and recovery in persons with OUD.\n\n**Publications**\n\n  * In a post hoc analysis of the SUBLOCADE randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial, published in [Harm Reduction Journal](https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-023-00906-7), SUBLOCADE 300 mg maintenance dose resulted in a statistically significant increase in abstinence from opioids among study participants with OUD who injected opioids compared to 100 mg maintenance dose. However, both were equally effective in non-injecting participants.\n  * Results from the Community Long-Acting Buprenorphine (CoLAB) Study, a prospective single-arm, multicenter, open label trial in Australia, were published in the [International Journal of Drug Policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395924000756?via%3Dihub), and demonstrated that participants could be maintained on SUBLOCADE treatment for 96 weeks with continuous improvements in abstinence, depression, quality of life and medication satisfaction.\n  * In a qualitative research survey of 20 participants representing various practice settings, published in [American Health & Drug Benefits](https://www.ahdbonline.com/web-exclusives/provider-and-payer-perspectives-on-the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-patients-with-opioid-use-disorder-multi-stakeholder-in-depth-interviews), it was determined that telemedicine was the most common solution adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic to overcome access barriers. However, today there are still significant challenges in ensuring appropriate access to medications for those living with OUD and continued support, effective solutions and policies in the United States, need to be continually addressed.\n  * In a narrowly focused literature, policy, and legal proceedings review, published in [Corrections Today](https://user-3imepyw.cld.bz/Corrections-Today-Summer-2024-Vol-86-No-2/24/), a clear disparity in access to MOUD was found between the general public and incarcerated individuals. Stigma and informed consent were the most discussed barriers used to justify policies limiting MOUD for incarcerated individuals. \n\n\n\n**Presentations** Multiple real-world evidence poster presentations highlight challenges and opportunities in treating persons with OUD.\n\n  * 2024 American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists, April 7-10, Orlando FL \n    * Title: Emergency Room (ER) Visits Among Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Patients\n    * Title: Opioid Treatment Programs, Healthcare Resource Utilization, and Healthcare Costs among Patients Initiating Treatment with Buprenorphine Extended-Release\n  * 2024 American Telemedicine Association Nexus, May 5-7, Phoenix AZ \n    * Title: Impact of Telemedicine on Medication for Opioid Use Disorder Retention during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Period Among Patients with OUD\n  * 2024 College on Problems of Drug Dependence, June 15-19, Montreal Quebec Canada \n    * Title: Buprenorphine Treatment After an Emergency Department Visit for Non-Fatal Opioid Overdose\n    * Title: Pain Predicts Abstinence During Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder for Individuals Reporting Moderate to Severe Pain\n    * Title: A Randomized Open-Label Study Comparing Rapid and Standard Inductions to Injectable Buprenorphine Extended-Release (BUP-XR) Treatment\n    * Title: A Mechanistic Pharmacological Model to Predict and Inform Effective Buprenorphine Treatment Induction Strategies in the Era of Synthetic Opioids\n  * 2024 U.S. Public Health Service Scientific & Training Symposium, June 24-27, Jacksonville FL \n    * Title: Clinical and Treatment Characteristics of American Indian/Alaska Native Patients Managing Opioid Use Disorder Compared to the General US Population\n  * BUPE2024 – Buprenorphine in Medicine: Clinical and Public Policy Implications, August 5, Virtual conference \n    * Title: Healthcare Utilization and Costs Associated with Management of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) within Residential Treatment Programs (RTP) and Office-Based Opioid Treatment Programs (OBOT)\n  * 2024 National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) Annual, October 19-23, Las Vegas, NV \n    * Title: Outcomes Associated with Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in the Carceral System: A Systematic Literature Review\n    * Title: Diversion of Medications for OUD in the Criminal Justice System\n\n\n\nDr. Christian Heidbreder, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Indivior, emphasized, \"The collective evidence highlights the importance of access to Medications for OUD, such as SUBLOCADE, in reducing barriers to adherence and improving outcomes for individuals in recovery. Indivior is committed to continuing to advance the understanding of patients with OUD, educate on evidence-based practices, overcome stigma, and focus on recovery outcomes.\"\n\nAmong the almost 6 million people aged 12 or older with a past year opioid use disorder in 2023, only 18% (or one million people) received treatment through MOUD.1\n\n**About SUBLOCADE®**\n\n**SUBLOCADE ® (buprenorphine extended-release) injection, for subcutaneous use, CIII**\n\n**INDICATION AND HIGHLIGHTED SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**INDICATION**\n\nSUBLOCADE is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder in patients who have initiated treatment with a buprenorphine-containing product, followed by dose adjustment for a minimum of 7 days.\n\nSUBLOCADE should be used as part of a complete treatment plan that includes counseling and psychosocial support.\n\n**HIGHLIGHTED SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS HARM OR DEATH WITH INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION; SUBLOCADE RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY**\n\n  * **Serious harm or death could result if administered intravenously. SUBLOCADE forms a solid mass upon contact with body fluids and may cause occlusion, local tissue damage, and thrombo-embolic events, including life threatening pulmonary emboli, if administered intravenously.**\n  * **Because of the risk of serious harm or death that could result from intravenous self-administration, SUBLOCADE is only available through a restricted program called the SUBLOCADE REMS Program. Healthcare settings and pharmacies that order and dispense SUBLOCADE must be certified in this program and comply with the REMS requirements.**\n\n\n\n**CONTRAINDICATIONS**\n\nSUBLOCADE should not be administered to patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to buprenorphine or any component of Indivior's proprietary buprenorphine gel depot delivery system.\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS** _Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse:_ SUBLOCADE contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors.\n\n_Respiratory Depression:_ Life threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with SUBLOCADE.\n\nOpioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders e.g., central sleep apnea (CSA), sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. Consider decreasing the opioid using best practices for opioid taper if CSA occurs.\n\nStrongly consider prescribing naloxone at SUBLOCADE initiation or renewal because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and how to treat with naloxone if prescribed.\n\n_Risk of Serious Injection Site Reactions:_ The most common injection site reactions are pain, erythema and pruritus with some involving abscess, ulceration, and necrosis. The likelihood of serious injection site reactions may increase with inadvertent intramuscular or intradermal administration.\n\n_Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome_ : Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy.\n\n_Adrenal Insufficiency_ : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off the opioid.\n\n_Risk of Opioid Withdrawal With Abrupt Discontinuation:_ If treatment with SUBLOCADE is discontinued, monitor patients for several months for withdrawal and treat appropriately.\n\n_Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events:_ Monitor liver function tests prior to and during treatment.\n\n_Risk of Withdrawal in Patients Dependent on Full Agonist Opioids_ : Verify that patient is clinically stable on transmucosal buprenorphine before injecting SUBLOCADE.\n\n_Treatment of Emergent Acute Pain:_ Treat pain with a non-opioid analgesic whenever possible. If opioid therapy is required, monitor patients closely because higher doses may be required for analgesic effect.\n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS** Adverse reactions commonly associated with SUBLOCADE (in ≥5% of subjects) were constipation, headache, nausea, injection site pruritus, vomiting, increased hepatic enzymes, fatigue, and injection site pain.\n\nFor more information about SUBLOCADE, the full Prescribing information including BOXED WARNING, and Medication Guide, visit [www.sublocade.com](https://www.sublocade.com/).\n\n**About Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)** Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a chronic disease in which people develop a pattern of using opioids that can lead to negative consequences.2 OUD may affect the parts of the brain that are necessary for life-sustaining functions.2,3\n\n**About Indivior** Indivior is a global pharmaceutical company working to help change patients' lives by developing medicines to treat substance use disorders (SUD), overdose and serious mental illnesses.

This dynamic, together with greater variability in the timing of funding among Criminal Justice System customers, as well as incremental trade stocking pressure, has resulted in net revenue below our expectations set out in July. We are reducing our FY 2024 guidance to reflect these impacts. In addition, looking to the year ahead, as the US market adjusts to two LAI products, pressure on SUBLOCADE volume growth is expected from continued initial competitor adoption. Therefore, we no longer expect that SUBLOCADE will exit 2025 at a $1 billion net revenue run rate._\n\n_We remain firm in our conviction that SUBLOCADE has a differentiated and optimal profile for opioid use disorder (OUD) patients, including our belief that it will best meet the increasing challenges that synthetic opioids are presenting to OUD patients and treatment providers. Additionally, we expect SUBLOCADE’s profile to be further enhanced with important label updates in February 2025 that, if approved by the FDA, are expected to improve both the patient and healthcare provider experience. We also are actively evaluating actions to fuel SUBLOCADE’s growth and to support margins._\n\n_Further, we have been tracking multiple market cohorts since the competitor’s launch a year ago and, while we have seen faster than expected initial adoption, recent market data is consistently showing that SUBLOCADE’s share is stabilizing at levels demonstrating its leading position in the clinic. Coupled with the continued expected growth of the wider LAI market, we believe this evidence validates the significant market opportunity we see for SUBLOCADE and we believe it confirms our unchanged peak annual SUBLOCADE NR expectation of greater than $1.5 billion.”_\n\n**Preliminary Q3 Net Revenue Expectations:**\n\nThe Group is providing the below preliminary expectations for key NR drivers for Q3 2024. \n\n**October 10, 2024**  \n---  \n**Net Revenue (NR)** |  $302m to $309m (+13% vs. Q3 2023 at the mid-point)   \n**SUBLOCADE NR** |  $187m to $192m (+14% vs. Q3 2023 at the mid-point)   \n**OPVEE** |  ~$15m  \n  \n  * **Competition:** Initial adoption among treatment providers for the competing LAI has been faster than expected. In particular, the Group has seen accelerated trial among Criminal Justice System (CJS) accounts. While this dynamic is adversely impacting SUBLOCADE NR in the near-term, the Group is seeing SUBLOCADE’s market share stabilizing in multiple early competitive cohorts at levels in line with the Group’s expectations of maintaining its leading position in the clinic.\n  * **CJS:** New CJS activations continued to grow in the third quarter. However, CJS NR is expected to decline versus the previous quarter due to greater variability in funding timing across certain CJS accounts in the near-term as well as from continued competitive pressure. The Group continues to see significant growth in interest and intention to treat with SUBLOCADE among its CJS accounts and therefore expects strong contribution to SUBLOCADE growth from this channel.\n  * **Stocking:** Stocking levels were lower than expected in the third quarter, as days of SUBLOCADE inventory on-hand were further reduced from the historically low levels seen in the first half of 2024. The Group believes its specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors have made permanent inventory adjustments to take advantage of shortened lead times associated with supply chain efficiencies to organized health system and CJS customers and have adjusted accordingly.\n  * **OPVEE:** OPVEE NR in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately $15 million driven by an additional product order from Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for approximately $8 million in late September. \n\n\n\n**Updated FY 2024 Guidance 1: **\n\n**Updated October 10, 2024** |  **July 25, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**Net Revenue (NR)** |  $1,125m to $1,165m (+5% at mid-point vs. FY 2023) |  $1,150m to $1,215m (+8% at mid-point vs. FY 2023)   \n**SUBLOCADE NR** |  $725m to $745m (+17% at mid-point vs. FY 2023) |  $765m to $805m (+25% at mid-point vs. FY 2023)   \n**OPVEE NR** |  Approx. $15m Predominantly from two optioned product deliveries as part of the 10-year BARDA2 contract |  $9m to $14m Predominantly expected to come from fulfilling first delivery as part of 10-year BARDA2 contract (~$8m)  \n**PERSERIS NR** |  $32m to $37m |  $27m to $33m  \n**SUBOXONE Film Market Share 3** |  No change |  Assumes historic rate of share decline of 1 to 2 percentage points and the potential impact from a fourth buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film generic in the U.S. market   \n**Adjusted Gross Margin** |  No change |  Low to mid 80% range  \n**Adjusted SG &A** |  ($555m) to ($560m) |  ($550m) to ($560m) Reflecting discontinuation of the sales and marketing of PERSERIS  \n**R &D** |  ($115m) to ($120m) |  ($120m) to ($130m)  \n**Adjusted Operating Profit** |  $260m to $280m (mid-point flat vs. FY 2023) |  $285m to $320m (approx. 100 bps of margin expansion vs. FY 2023)  \n  \n1 Guidance assumes no material change in exchange rates for key currencies compared with FY 2023 average rates, notably USD/GBP and USD/EUR\n\n2 Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority\n\n3 Reflecting underlying share erosion at a similar rate to the last two years (approximately 2 share points p.a.)\n\n**Conference Call Information:**\n\n_Indivior will host a presentation via live webcast at 1:00 p.m. London time (8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern) today.
