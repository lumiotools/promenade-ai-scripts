Insight’s and Alpha Modus’ actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying these statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, Insight’s and Alpha Modus’ expectations with respect to future performance and anticipated financial impacts of the proposed Business Combination, the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the proposed Business Combination, and the timing of the completion of the proposed Business Combination.\n\nThese forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside Insight’s and Alpha Modus’ control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change, or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the BCA; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Insight and Alpha Modus following the announcement of the BCA and the transactions contemplated therein; (3) the inability to complete the proposed Business Combination, including due to failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of Insight and Alpha Modus, certain regulatory approvals, or satisfy other conditions to closing in the BCA; (4) the occurrence of any event, change, or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the BCA or could otherwise cause the transaction to fail to close; (5) the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Alpha Modus’ business and/or the ability of the parties to complete the proposed Business Combination; (6) the inability to obtain the listing of the combined company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market following the proposed Business Combination; (7) the risk that the proposed Business Combination disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the proposed Business Combination; (8) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of Alpha Modus to grow and manage growth profitably, and retain its key employees; (9) costs related to the proposed Business Combination; (10) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (11) the possibility that Insight and Alpha Modus may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (12) risks relating to the uncertainty of the projected financial information with respect to Alpha Modus; (13) risks related to the organic and inorganic growth of Alpha Modus’ business and the timing of expected business milestones; (14) the amount of redemption requests made by Insight’s stockholders; and (15) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the final prospectus of Insight for its initial public offering and the registration statement on Form S-4, including the proxy statement relating to the proposed Business Combination, including those enumerated under “Risk Factors” therein, and in Insight’s other filings with the SEC. Insight cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. Insight and Alpha Modus caution readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Insight and Alpha Modus do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in their expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\n**No Offer or Solicitation**\n\nThis press release shall not constitute a solicitation of a proxy, consent, or authorization with respect to any securities or in respect of the proposed Business Combination. This press release shall also not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any states or jurisdictions in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

          "content": "INSIGHT ACQUISITION CORP.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES\nEffective September 1, 2021\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Insight Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) has\nadopted these Corporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) to assist the Board in its\nexercise of its responsibilities, to assist the Board in complying with the New York Stock\nExchange (the “NYSE”) rules and other legal requirements. These Guidelines reflect the\nBoard’s judgment as it relates to sound corporate governance practices by which the Board\noversees the Company’s business affairs. These Guidelines are not intended to change or\ninterpret any federal or state law or regulation or the certificate of incorporation of the Company\n(as it may be amended or restated from time to time, the “Charter”). These Guidelines are\nsubject to change from time to time by the Board in its sole discretion.\nI. BOARD COMPOSITION AND DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS\nA. Board Membership Criteria\nSubject to the terms of any stockholders’ agreement that sets forth procedures governing\nthe nomination of directors to the Board or if the Company is otherwise required to provide third\nparties with the ability to nominate directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee (the “Governance Committee”) is responsible for reviewing the background and\nqualifications of individuals being considered as director candidates and recommending any\nproposed changes to the Board. Among the qualifications considered in the selection of\ncandidates, the Governance Committee will look at the following attributes and criteria of\ncandidates: experience, skills, expertise, diversity, personal and professional integrity, character,\nbusiness judgment, time availability in light of other commitments, dedication and conflicts of\ninterest. The Governance Committee may, if it deems appropriate, establish procedures to be\nfollowed by stockholders in submitting recommendations for Board candidates and the\nGovernance Committee’s policies for consideration of Board candidates recommended by\nstockholders.\nB. Independent Directors\nThe Company defines an “independent” director in accordance with Section 303A.02 of\nthe NYSE Listed Company Manual. Subject to the phase-in rules of the NYSE, the Board will\nbe composed of a majority of independent directors. Whether directors are independent will be\nreviewed annually in connection with the preparation of the Company’s proxy statement. The\nGovernance Committee, as well as the Board, will review commercial and other relationships\nbetween directors and the Company to make a determination regarding the independence of each\n124083321v3\nof the directors, but the final independence determination will be made by the Board after due\ndeliberation.\nC. Directors Who Cease to be Independent\nAn independent director who ceases to qualify as such after election to the Board will be\nrequired to tender a resignation as a director promptly to the Governance Committee. The\nGovernance Committee will consider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board\nwhether to accept or reject the resignation, taking into consideration the effect of such change on\nthe interests of the Company.\nD. Directors Who Change Their Job Responsibility\nWhen a director’s principal occupation or business association changes substantially from\nthat which he or she held when originally invited to join the Board (including retirement), he or\nshe will be required to tender a resignation as a director promptly to the Governance Committee.\nThe Governance Committee will consider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board\nwhether to accept or reject the resignation, taking into consideration the effect of such change on\nthe interests of the Company.\nE. Resignation, Retirement or Refusal to Stand for Reelection\nIn the event that a director intends to resign or retire from, or refuse to stand for\nreelection to, the Board, he or she must tender written notice of such intent directly to the\nExecutive Chairman of the Board (the “Chairman”) and the Chief Executive Officer, who will\nshare such notice with legal counsel. The Board, taking into account any recommendation of the\nGovernance Committee, shall determine the action, if any, to be taken with respect to such\nnotice. Except as may be provided in the Charter, there are no established limits for retirement\nfrom the Board.\nF. Board Tenure\nExcept as may be provided in the Charter, there are no established term limits for service\non the Board. Directors shall be elected for the terms provided in the Charter. The Board may\nnominate a director for reelection based on the recommendation of the Governance Committee.\nG. Notification of Additional Board Service\nDirectors will advise the Chairman and the chairperson of the Governance Committee in\nadvance of accepting an invitation to serve on another company board. Service on boards and\ncommittees of other organizations should be consistent with the Company’s Code of Business\nConduct and Ethics. If a member of the Company’s Audit Committee serves on more than two\naudit committees, the Board will determine whether such simultaneous service impairs the\ndirector’s ability to serve effectively on the Company’s Audit Committee. The Board does not\nfeel that it is appropriate to limit the number of company boards on which directors may serve.\n2\n124083321v3\nII. BOARD OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe business affairs of the Company are managed under the direction of the Board. The\nBoard believes that the primary responsibilities of directors are to exercise their business\njudgment in good faith and to act in what they reasonably believe is in the best interests of the\nCompany and its stockholders. Directors must fulfill their responsibilities consistent with their\nfiduciary duty to stockholders, in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations and\nsubject to the provisions of the Charter. In forming his or her judgment, each director is entitled\nto rely in good faith on the accuracy of the records of the Company and the information,\nopinions, reports or statements presented by the Company’s officers, employees, Board\ncommittees, outside advisors and auditors. In discharging that obligation, directors are entitled\nto rely on the honesty and integrity of the Company’s senior executives and its outside advisors\nand auditors.\nIII. BOARD MEETINGS AND PROCEDURES\nA. Meeting Frequency\nFollowing the Company’s initial business combination, the Board will hold at least one\nregularly scheduled meeting each quarter.\nB. Chairman of the Board\nThe Chairman will preside over all meetings of the directors, be responsible for the\nagenda at all meetings of the Board and will preside over meetings of stockholders. The\nChairman will convey recommendations of the independent directors to the Board and will be\nthe liaison between the Board and the management of the Company. The Chairman will preview\ninformation sent to the Board as necessary and approve meeting schedules to assure that there is\nsufficient time for discussion of all agenda items.\nC. Agenda Items\nEach director is free to suggest agenda items to the Chairman and to raise at any meeting\ntopics not on the agenda.\nD. Attendance\nAll directors are expected to make reasonable best efforts to attend all meetings of the\nBoard, meetings of the committees of which they are members and the annual meeting of\nstockholders. Members are encouraged to attend Board meetings and meetings of committees of\nwhich they are members in person, but may also attend such meetings by telephone or video\nconference.\nE. Meeting Materials and Preparation\n3\n124083321v3\nInformation and materials important to the Board’s understanding of topics expected to\nbe discussed at meetings should, to the extent practical, be distributed sufficiently in advance to\npermit prior review. In the event of a meeting on short notice, or if materials would contain\nhighly confidential or sensitive information, it is recognized that written materials might not be\navailable in advance.\nEach director should be sufficiently familiar with the business of the Company, including\nits financial statements and capital structure, and the risks and competition it faces, to facilitate\nactive and effective participation in the deliberations of the Board and of each committee on\nwhich he or she serves. Management will make appropriate personnel available to answer any\nquestions a director may have about any aspect of the Company’s business. Directors should\nalso review the materials provided by management and advisors in advance of the meetings of\nthe Board and its committees and should arrive prepared to discuss the issues presented.\nF. Separate Sessions of Non-Management Directors\nNon-management directors will meet regularly, in executive session, without\nmanagement. If not a member of management, the Chairman will preside in executive session.\nIf the Chairman is absent or disqualified, the chairperson of the Audit Committee, if\nindependent, will preside. If the chairperson of the Audit Committee is absent, or not\nindependent, an independent director designated by the other independent directors will preside.\nIn the event that the non-management directors include directors who are not\nindependent, the Company will, at least once a year, schedule an executive session including\nonly independent directors.\nIV. DIRECTOR COMMUNICATIONS\nA. Director Communications with Management and Outside Advisors\nIt is management’s job to formulate, propose and implement strategic choices and the\nBoard’s role to approve and evaluate strategic direction and results. However, the Board and\nmanagement are better able to perform their responsibilities if there is an ongoing dialogue\namong the Chief Executive Officer, other senior managers and Board members. To facilitate\nthese discussions, directors will have access to the Company’s senior management team. The\nBoard and its committees shall have the right at any time to retain independent outside\naccounting, financial, legal or other advisors, and the Company shall provide appropriate\nfunding, as determined by the Board or any committee, to compensate such independent outside\nadvisors, as well as to cover the ordinary administrative expenses incurred by the Board and its\ncommittee s in carrying out their duties. In the event that the Board proposes to incur any\nmaterial expenses not expressly covered by these Guidelines, the Charter, the Company’s\nBylaws or the charters of the Board’s various committees, the Board shall discuss such expenses\nwith the Company’s senior management team prior to incurring such expenses.\nB. Board Interaction with Institutional Investors, Analysts, Press and Customers\n4\n124083321v3\nGenerally, management should speak for the Company. Each director should refer all\ninquiries from institutional investors, analysts, the press or customers to the Chief Executive\nOfficer or his or her designee.\nV. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nThe Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, will establish the\nform and amount of compensation to be paid to directors following the Company’s initial\nbusiness combination, if any, and review this compensation each year.\nVI.

The Company will pay all reasonable expenses related to the\ncontinuing director education.\nVII. COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD\nA. Number, Structure and Appointment of Committee Members\nThe Board shall have at all times three (3) standing committees: (i) an Audit Committee;\n(ii) a Compensation Committee; and (iii) a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\nAll members of these committees shall be independent directors, subject to the phase-in rules of\nthe NYSE, and shall be appointed by the Board upon recommendation of the Governance\nCommittee. The Board may, from time to time, establish or maintain additional committees as\nnecessary or appropriate.\nB. Committee Charters\nEach committee shall discharge its responsibilities in accordance with its own charter.\nEach committee charter shall set forth: the purposes, goals and responsibilities of the committee;\nqualifications for membership on the committee; and committee structure and operations. Each\ncommittee charter shall also specify procedures for committee member appointment and\nremoval, as well as require that the committee annually evaluate its performance and report its\nassessment to the Governance Committee.\n5\n124083321v3\nC.

Each committee member may recommend items for inclusion on the committee’s\nmeeting agenda.\nVIII. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT\nA. Evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer\nIn accordance with the terms of its charter, the Compensation Committee will conduct an\nannual review of the Chief Executive Officer’s performance and report its conclusions to the\nindependent directors of the Board. The evaluation should be based on objective criteria\nincluding, but not limited to, the performance of the Company’s business, accomplishment of the\nCompany’s goal of completing an initial business combination and, thereafter, its long-term and\nshort-term strategic objectives and management development.\nB. Succession Planning\nFrom and after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, the\nCompensation Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, shall annually report\nto the Board on succession planning, which shall include emergency Chief Executive Officer\nsuccession, Chief Executive Officer succession in the ordinary course and succession for other\nmembers of senior management. The entire Board will work with the Compensation Committee\nto evaluate potential successors to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer\nshould at all times make available his or her recommendations and evaluations of potential\nsuccessors, along with a review of any development plans recommended for such individuals.\nIX.

The Governance Committee shall be responsible for\nconducting this evaluation by annually assessing the performance of the Board and its\ncommittees, and reporting its conclusions to the full Board. In performing its review, the\ncommittee shall solicit and consider the input of all of the directors through an evaluation\nprocess in which each director is asked to critically evaluate the performance of the Board and\neach committee on which he or she serves. At the discretion of the committee, this review may,\nfrom time to time, include input from each director on the performance of each other Board\nmember. Candor shall be encouraged by ensuring that evaluations are and remain anonymous.\nThis responsibility is in addition to, and shall be coordinated with, the committee’s responsibility\nto annually assess whether the appropriate balance of skills and characteristics are represented on\nthe Board.\n6\n124083321v3\nX.
