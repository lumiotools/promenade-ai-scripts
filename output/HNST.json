Our ability to grow profitably is evidenced in our results -- with double digit revenue growth reaching an all-time high, significant expansion in gross margin, and positive net income for the period,” said Chief Executive Officer, Carla Vernón. “We are confident that our long-term growth strategy will continue to allow us to scale across our categories, meeting the growing consumer demand for cleanly-formulated and sustainably-designed products across our portfolio. With our recent performance, continued positive momentum, and overall strength of the Honest brand going into the final quarter of the year, we are again raising our full year financial outlook.”\n\n**Third****Quarter Results**** _(All comparisons are versus the_**** _third_**** _quarter of_**** _2023_**** _)_**\n\n**For the three months ended****September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**|  **2023**| **Change**  \n _(In thousands, except percentages)_  \nRevenue| $| 99,237| $| 86,169| 15.2| %  \nGross margin| 38.7| %| 31.6| %| 710| bps  \nOperating expenses| $| 38,339| $| 35,197| $| 3,142  \nNet income (loss)| $| 165| $| (8,098| )| $| 8,263  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1)| $| 7,079| $| (1,056| )| $| 8,135  \nNet income margin| 0.2| %| NM| NM  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(1)| 7.1| %| NM| NM  \n  \n**Revenue** increased 15% to $99 million compared to $86 million, driven by strong performance across our baby products and wipes portfolios. Tracked channel consumption(2) for the Company grew 9.3% outperforming the comparative categories which were down 2.4% in the same period. Consumption(3) for the Company’s products at the Company’s largest digital customer increased 19%. ______________(1) See the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income (loss) in the table under “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below in this press release.(2) According to Circana, Inc. tracked channel consumption data. Reflects consumption for diapers, wipes, baby personal care, skin care and cosmetics items for the latest 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024.(3) According to Fuelcomm, Inc. (“Stackline”) consumption data for our largest digital customer for the 13 weeks ended September 28, 2024.\n\n**Gross margin** expanded 710 basis points to 38.7% compared to 31.6%. This growth was primarily driven by improvements across most of the cost structure, including supply chain and product cost efficiencies, as well as efficient trade spend.\n\n**Operating expenses** increased $3 million to $38 million, reflecting a decrease of 221 basis points, as a percentage of revenue. The Company continues to maintain expense discipline across the enterprise with selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreasing 441 basis points, partially offset by increased investment in retail marketing to drive our Brand Maximization pillar.\n\n**Net income** increased $8 million to $165 thousand compared to a net loss of $8 million. Increased net revenue and expansion in gross margin more than offset increased operating expenses to deliver positive net income in the quarter.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**(1) was positive $7 million compared to negative $1 million. This represents the Company’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. ________________(1) See the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net income (loss) in the table under “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below in this press release.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nThe Company ended the third quarter of 2024 with $53 million in cash and cash equivalents, a sequential increase of $17 million from the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of $30 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The Company had no debt on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $18 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $9 million in the prior year period.\n\n**Updated Full Year 2024 Outlook**\n\nBased on strong performance in the first three quarters of the year, we are increasing our full year 2024 outlook for both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n**Current Outlook**| **Prior Outlook (as of Q2 2024)**  \n---|---  \n**Revenue**|  High Single Digit percentage growth _(versus Full Year 2023)_|  Mid-to-High Single Digit percentage growth _(versus Full Year 2023)_  \n**Adjusted EBITDA****(1)**|  $20 million to $22 million range| $15 million to $18 million range  \n  \n____________\n\n(1) We do not provide guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between our adjusted EBITDA outlook and net income (loss) without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain components of net income (loss), including interest and other (income) expense, net, and the respective reconciliations. These items are not within our control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact our financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nA webcast and conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 results is scheduled for today, November 12, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time/4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

However, management believes that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP financial measures, provides investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance.\n\nWe calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: (1) interest and other (income) expense, net; (2) income tax provision; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) stock-based compensation expense, including payroll tax; (5) litigation and settlement fees associated with certain non-ordinary course securities litigation claims; (6) Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and founder and former Chief Creative Officer (“CCO”) transition expenses and (7) restructuring expenses in connection with the Transformation Initiative. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA margin by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to our investors as they are a measure used by management in assessing the health of our business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin include that (1) it does not reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future; (2) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin does not reflect these capital expenditures; (3) it does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense; (4) it does not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest expense; (5) it does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (6) does not include certain non-ordinary cash expenses that we do not believe are representative of our business on a steady-state basis, such as CEO and founder/CCO transition expenses and restructuring expenses in connection with the Transformation Initiative. In addition, our use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin in the same manner, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial measures, including our revenue, net income (loss) and other results stated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP, to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, for each of the periods presented:\n\n**For the three months endedSeptember 30,**| **For the nine months endedSeptember 30,**  \n---|---  \n_(In thousands)_|  **2024**|  **2023**|  **2024**|  **2023**  \n**Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA**  \nNet income (loss)| $| 165| $| (8,098| )| $| (5,314| )| $| (40,381| )  \nInterest and other (income) expense, net| (127| )| 71| (44| )| 269  \nIncome tax provision| 19| 35| 56| 75  \nDepreciation and amortization| 706| 681| 2,132| 2,021  \nStock-based compensation| 2,166| 3,707| 13,593| 13,892  \nSecurities litigation expense| 4,089| 1,374| 5,759| 4,325  \nCEO and founder/CCO transition expense(1)| —| 808| 858| 2,085  \nRestructuring costs(2)| —| 357| —| 2,104  \nPayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation| 61| 9| 277| 122  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 7,079| $| (1,056| )| $| 17,317| $| (15,488| )  \nRevenue| $| 99,237| $| 86,169| $| 278,503| $| 254,101  \nNet income margin| 0.2| %| NM| NM| NM  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin| 7.1| %| NM| 6.2| %| NM  \n  \n__________________\n\n(1) Includes sign-on bonus and relocation costs related to the appointment of our CEO and separation costs related to the termination of our former founder and CCO.

However, management believes that adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance.\n\nWe calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: (1) interest and other (income) expense, net; (2) income tax provision; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) stock-based compensation expense, including payroll tax; (5) litigation and settlement fees associated with certain non-ordinary course securities litigation claims; (6) Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and founder and former Chief Creative Officer (“CCO”) transition expenses and (7) restructuring expenses in connection with the Transformation Initiative.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a measure used by management in assessing the health of our business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of adjusted EBITDA include that (1) it does not reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future; (2) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures; (3) it does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense; (4) it does not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest expense; (5) it does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (6) does not include certain non-ordinary cash expenses that we do not believe are representative of our business on a steady-state basis, such as CEO and founder/CCO transition expenses and restructuring expenses in connection with the Transformation Initiative. In addition, our use of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate adjusted EBITDA in the same manner, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial measures, including our revenue, net income (loss) and other results stated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP, to adjusted EBITDA, for each of the periods presented:\n\n**For the three months ended June 30,**| **For the six months ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n_(In thousands)_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA**  \nNet loss| $| (4,077| )| $| (13,416| )| $| (5,479| )| $| (32,282| )  \nInterest and other (income) expense, net| 19| 9| 82| 198  \nIncome tax provision| 13| 20| 38| 40  \nDepreciation and amortization| 709| 672| 1,426| 1,340  \nStock-based compensation| 8,905| 6,413| 11,428| 10,185  \nSecurities litigation expense| 1,268| 1,773| 1,670| 2,951  \nCEO and founder/CCO transition expense(1)| 700| —| 858| 1,277  \nRestructuring costs(2)| —| 397| —| 1,747  \nPayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation| 58| 33| 216| 112  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 7,595| $| (4,099| )| $| 10,239| $| (14,432| )  \n  \n__________________\n\n(1) Includes sign-on bonus and relocation costs related to the appointment of our CEO and separation costs related to the termination of our former founder and CCO.
