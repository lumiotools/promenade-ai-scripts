Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results and Provides Corporate Update\n\nNov 13, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/7191/pdf)\n\nIRVINE, Calif., Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cheetah Net Supply Chain Service Inc. (“Cheetah” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq CM: CTNT), a provider of warehousing and logistics, today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided a corporate update.\n\n**Recent Highlights***\n\n  * On July 23, 2024, the Company relocated its headquarters from Charlotte, NC to Irvine, CA, in order to implement its business model transformation, be closer to the important Southern California market, take advantage of the region’s well-developed infrastructure and logistics networks, capitalize on the area’s large consumer presence, and gain access to California’s skilled labor force.\n  * On July 26, 2024, the Company closed a public offering of 404,979 shares of its Class A common stock at an offering price of $3.68 per share, pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-280743), which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 10, 2024 and declared effective on July 15, 2024, generating net proceeds of $1.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other related expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. \n  * On August 16, 2024, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) approved the adoption of the Company’s Amended and Restated 2024 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Subsequently, on September 30, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the Plan and the compensation committee of the Board granted stock awards of 118,750 shares of Class A common stock and 31,250 shares of Class B common stock. Share-based compensation expenses of $261,666 were recognized during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n  * At a special stockholders’ meeting held on September 30, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s Fourth Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to authorize a reverse stock split. Subsequently, on October 7, 2024, the Board approved the a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-16 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split took effect on October 21, 2024. Starting on October 24, 2024, the Company’s Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-split basis.\n\n\n\n*All share numbers are retrospectively adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split.\n\nTony Liu, Cheetah’s Chairman and CEO commented, “Since the second quarter of this year, the Company has been undergoing a business transformation from the previous parallel-import vehicle business, which had shrunk substantially due to the deteriorating Chinese macroeconomy conditions since the second half of 2022, to the logistics and warehousing business, which utilizes more the international trade flows between the PRC and U.S. markets. Additionally, our headquarters relocation to Irvine, CA will enable a stronger management focus on our new business line due to Irvine’s proximity to the important ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Management will continue to take initiatives to seek out new business opportunities. While we believe that tangible results of these efforts may not be apparent for several quarters, we have confidence that we are positioning the Company for substantial future growth in this business.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company generated $61,208 in revenue from its logistics and warehousing operations, with no revenue from its parallel-import vehicle business. Compared to the Company’s total revenue of $10.0 million for the same period in 2023, this represented a decrease of $9.9 million, or 99.4%. The decline was primarily driven by the continued downturn in the Company’s parallel-import vehicle business.\n\nGross profit from the combined business segments in the third quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately $1.1 million, or 97.4%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of revenue, the gross margin increased from 11.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 48.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which increased by $0.6 million, or 108.0%, from $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in (i) personnel-related expenses and rental expenses to support the newly launched logistics and warehousing segment, (ii) recurring expenses associated with new business lines, aligning with the Company’s strategic shift towards logistics and warehousing, (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily due to the acquisition of new fixed assets and additional intangible assets from the acquisition of Edward Transit Express Group Inc. (“Edward”); and (iv) insurance expenses due to higher costs associated with directors and officers insurance.\n\nAllowance of credit loss of accounts receivable was $1.1 million as compared to nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company assessed the collection of aged accounts receivable related to parallel-import vehicles business and made $1.1 million of allowance of credit loss on accounts overdue by 210 days. Management will continue to review the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances.\n\nShare-based compensation expenses was $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to nil for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNet loss was $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with net income of $0.1 million for the same period 2023.\n\n**Nine Months 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.9 million, compared to $32.5 million for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of $30.6 million, or 94.3%. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in the Company’s parallel-import vehicle business. Since the acquisition of Edward, the Company generated revenue of $231,605 from its logistics and warehousing business, representing approximately 12.4% of its total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nGross profit decreased by approximately $3.5 million, or 97.5%, to $87,348 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $8.9 million for the same period in 2023, primarily in line with the decreased sales of parallel-import vehicles. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin was 11.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.7% for the same period in 2023.\n\nSelling expenses decreased to approximately $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was the result of the contraction in vehicle sales volume that naturally led to a reduction in associated selling activities, reflecting current market demand dynamics. Selling expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.3% and 1.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased by $1.0 million, or 63.2%, to $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to (i) an increase in personnel-related expenses by approximately $0.4 million, which was attributed to the hiring of additional staff to support the newly launched logistics and warehousing segment, (ii) an increase of $0.1 million in rental and leases following the acquisition of Edward with the addition of a new office workspace in California, (iii) an increase of $0.1 million in recruiting expenses associated with the development of new business lines, aligning with the Company’s strategic shift towards logistics and warehousing, (iv) an increase of $0.1 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily due to the acquisition of new fixed assets and additional intangible assets; (v) an increase of $0.2 million in insurance expenses due to higher costs associated with directors and officers insurance, and (vi) an increase of $0.1 million in other miscellaneous general and administration expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAllowance of credit loss of accounts receivable was $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company assessed the collection of aged accounts receivable related to parallel-import vehicles business and made $1.1 million of allowance of credit loss on accounts overdue by 210 days. Management will continue to review the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and make general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances.\n\nShare-based compensation expenses was $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nInterest expenses decreased by approximately $1.0 million, or 89.2%, to approximately $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to (i) significant declines in inventory financing, LC financing, and line of credit financing activities as the result of continuing reduction in vehicle sales and a decline in the need for such financing for parallel-import vehicles operation, and (ii) the Company’s paying down debts in line of credit financing and line of credits, using the capital infusion from its initial public offering in August 2023 and the follow-on offerings in May and July 2024.\n\nNet loss was $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with net income of $0.2 million for the same period of last year.\n\n**_Liquidity and Cash Flow_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $5.3 million and its working capital amounted to approximately $11.6 million, consisting of $12.4 million of current assets less $0.8 million of current liabilities, including $0.4 million of operating lease liabilities, $0.3 million of other payables, and $0.1 million of other current liabilities.\n\nThe Company also reported cash provided by operating activities of $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and total stockholders’ equity of $14.0 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s working capital cushion is supported by its financing activities and its ability to borrow under its existing credit facilities.\n\nThe Company is working to further improve its liquidity and capital sources primarily by generating cash from operations, debt financing, and, if needed, financial support from its principal stockholder. If necessary to fully implement its business plan and sustain continued growth, the Company may seek additional equity financing from outside investors. Based on the current operating plan, management believes that the aforementioned measures collectively will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the Company’s future liquidity and capital requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance date of its consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements that are predictive in nature.

Announces Second Quarter 2024 Results and Provides Corporate Update\n\nAug 13, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/7066/pdf)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cheetah Net Supply Chain Service Inc. (“Cheetah” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq CM: CTNT), a provider of warehousing and logistics services and a seller of parallel-import vehicles sourced from the U.S. market and sold into the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”), today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and provided a corporate update.\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Challenging market conditions in the PRC, first reported with respect to the Company’s financial performance during the second half of 2023, have continued into 2024. The Company’s three- and six- month financial results were impacted by these unfavorable market conditions, resulting in a significant decline in revenue. Adverse market conditions continue to severely depress or eliminate the margin between U.S. retail prices of select luxury car models and their wholesale prices in the parallel-vehicle market.\n  * The Company sold one vehicle during the second quarter of 2024, compared with 93 vehicles for the same period in 2023. The vehicle sales revenue for the second quarter of 2024 amounted to $0.2 million compared with $12.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decline in revenue resulted in a net loss of $0.6 million during the second quarter of 2024 compared with income of $0.2 million during the second quarter of 2023.\n  * The Company is moving beyond the parallel-import vehicle business with the goal of becoming an integrated provider of international trade services and financing for small- and medium-sized traders. The Company generated more than $70,000 in warehousing and logistics revenue from non-vehicle-related wholesalers during the second quarter of 2024 following the acquisition of Edward Transit Express Group Inc. in February 2024.\n  * In June 2024, the Company announced its planned headquarters move from Charlotte, NC to Irvine, CA to be closer to the important Southern California market, take advantage of well-developed infrastructure and logistics networks that already exist in the region, capitalize on the area’s large consumer presence, and gain access to California’s skilled labor force.\n\n\n\nTony Liu, Cheetah’s Chairman and CEO commented, “The parallel-vehicle import market has continued to be significantly affected by the adverse market conditions resulting from significant price discounting by luxury import brands, and a shift in consumer interest to domestic EVs. In response, we are accelerating our efforts to grow our logistics and warehouse operations. Beginning in the second quarter, we are increasing our marketing staff to seek out new business opportunities and help concentrate our efforts on international trade flows between the PRC and U.S. markets. In addition, we recently announced our planned headquarters move from Charlotte, NC to Irvine, CA, which we believe will help intensify management focus on our logistics and warehouse business given its proximity to the important ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. While we believe that tangible results of these efforts may not be apparent for several quarters, we have confidence that we are positioning the Company for substantial future growth in this business.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues for the quarter were $0.3 million, compared with $12.2 million for the same quarter last year. This substantial decrease is primarily due to the significant decline in the Company’s parallel-import vehicle business. Revenue from this business segment dropped by approximately $12.0 million, or 98.4%.\n\nTotal cost of revenue from parallel-import vehicles sold decreased by approximately $10.8 million, or 98.0%, from $11.0 million in the second quarter of 2023 to $0.2 million in 2024. The Company’s cost of revenue from parallel-import vehicles sold amounted to 107.8% and 89.8%, respectively, of its parallel-import vehicle revenue. The decrease in total cost of parallel-import vehicles sold reflected in large part the reduction in the number of vehicles sold.\n\nThe Company reported total revenue of approximately $0.1 million generated from logistics and warehousing services during the second quarter of 2024, representing about 31.8% of its total revenues. This includes more than $70,000 derived from non-vehicle-related services. Ocean freight expenses directly related to the warehousing and services segment amounted to approximately $45,000.\n\nSelling expenses decreased significantly to approximately $20,000, representing 6.6% of the Company’s total revenues, a $0.1 million decline from the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in selling expenses can be attributed primarily to the contraction in vehicle sales volume.\n\nNet loss was $0.6 million, compared with net income of $0.2 million, for the same period last year.\n\n**Six Months 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues for the first half of 2024 were $1.8 million compared with $22.4 million for the same period last year. This significant decrease was primarily due to a continued decline in the Company’s parallel-import vehicle business. During the first half of 2024, the Company sold 14 vehicles, compared with 175 for the same period last year.\n\nTotal cost of revenue from parallel-import vehicles sold was $1.6 million compared with $20.0 million for the same period last year, a decline of 91.7% attributed to the lower volume of parallel-import vehicles sold. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, total cost as a percentage of revenue was 101.5% and 89.3%, respectively.\n\nThe Company reported total revenue of approximately $0.2 million generated from logistics and warehousing services during the first half of 2024, representing about 9.5% of the total revenues. This includes approximately $0.1 million derived from non-vehicle-related services. Ocean freight expenses directly related to the warehousing and services segment amounted to approximately $90,000.\n\nSelling expenses were $0.1 million, a decrease of 76.6%, compared with $0.4 million from the same period last year. This decrease was the result of the contraction in vehicle sales volume that naturally led to a reduction in associated selling activities, reflecting current market demand dynamics.\n\nNet loss was $1.2 million, compared with net income of $0.05 million, for the same period last year.\n\n**_Liquidity and Cash Flow_**\n\nThe Company reported cash of $6.3 million as of June 30, 2024. The Company’s working capital amounted to approximately $12.4 million, consisting of $13.6 million of current assets less $1.2 million of current liabilities, of which $0.8 million represents loans payable, current portion of long-term debt, and operating lease liabilities. The Company’s working capital cushion is supported by its financing activities and its ability to borrow under its existing credit facilities.\n\nThe Company is working to further improve its liquidity and capital sources primarily by generating cash from operations, debt financing, and, if needed, financial support from its principal stockholder. If necessary to fully implement its business plan and sustain continued growth, the Company may seek additional equity financing from outside investors. Based on the current operating plan, management believes that the aforementioned measures collectively will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the Company’s future liquidity and capital requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance date of its consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements that are predictive in nature. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current expectations and assumptions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking expressions, including, but not limited to, “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “may,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would,” and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its registration statement on Form S-1, as amended, under the caption “Risk Factors.”\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nCheetah Net Supply Chain Service Inc.
