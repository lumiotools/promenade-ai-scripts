The manufacturer had issues withcritical assets, contributing to millions in avoidable costs from unplanned downtime and lost production. ICI provided thermal imaging cameras and AI-driven software, SmartIR, for 24/7 monitoring of critical assets and processes, reducing asset failures by 62% in the first year. This saved the client around $550,000 in unplanned downtime costs.\n\n### **The Industry**\n\nLeading paper manufacturers rely on ICI’s [SmartIR Platform](/smartir-platform) for early fire detection and improved asset reliability. SmartIR identifies overheating equipment and flammable materials in their earliest stages, allowing for timely intervention and preventing fires. It also identifies problematic equipment before failure, enabling maintenance teams to address issues during scheduled maintenance hours. ICI’s clients have experienced decreased insurance premiums and safety incidents, increased production uptime, and reduced maintenance and material costs. SmartIR users typically see a 300% return on investment in the first year of use. Common applications in pulp and paper manufacturing include:early fire detection throughout the facility and manufacturing process; electrical asset monitoring such as breakers, fuses and connectors; and monitoring mechanical assets such as motors, pumps, blades and conveyance systems.\n\n### **The Challenge**\n\nA US pulp and paper manufacturer had a sawmill fire without an early detection system, causing $3.42 million in damages, lost inventory, administrative costs, and lost production. The companyalso had reliability issues with critical assets, with an average of $1.1 million in avoidable costs yearly due to unplanned downtime and lost production. This was because of a calendar-based inspectionprocess that missed failing equipment leading to multiple critical asset failures each quarter.\n\n### **ICI's Solution**\n\nAfter consulting with the client, ICI installed 14 premier thermal imaging cameras, the FMX 400, combined with [ICI’s SmartIR software](/smartir-platform). By using the cameras’ wide field of view, ICI covered between 3 and 8 areas of interest per camera, limiting costs while ensuring complete coverage. SmartIR provided 24/7 monitoring of critical assets and high-risk locations within the facility. It was integrated into the client’s existing fire suppression system, sending immediate automated alerts toensure quick intervention for potential issues. The client’s reliability team also used SmartIR to monitor critical mechanical assets for maintenance needs. The solution allowed the customer to access live video feeds worldwide, receive instant alerts, and store data for improved safety and standard operating procedures.\n\n### **The Results**\n\nSmartIR’s early fire detection decreased insurance premiums by 15% and prevented fire. It also reduced asset failures by 62% in the first year, saving nearly $550,000 in downtime costs. The client estimated a 4.64X ROI on fire prevention and 11.4x ROI on asset reliability in the first year. Theyare implementing SmartIR in their southern US sites after sharing these results internally.\n\nLearn more about [ICI's SmartIR solution for distribution facilities](/smartir-platform) or [schedule a demo](/smartir-platform#contact-form) today.\n\nTags: [Case Study](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/tag/case-study), [Software](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/tag/software), [SmartIR](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/tag/smartir), [Distribution & Logistics](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/tag/distribution-logistics), [Manufacturing](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/tag/manufacturing), [Sawmill](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/tag/sawmill)\n\n[Back to Blog](https://infraredcameras.com/blog)\n\n  * [Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n  * Share\n\n\n\n## Related Articles\n\n[ ](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/optical-gas-imaging-improves-plant-safety)\n\n## [How Optical Gas Imaging Can Improve Plant Safety](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/optical-gas-imaging-improves-plant-safety)\n\nIf you’re a plant safety manager, you need accurate and actionable insights to manage risks in your... \n\n[Read More ](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/optical-gas-imaging-improves-plant-safety)\n\n[ ](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/infrared-cameras-coronavirus-spread)\n\n## [How Infrared Cameras Can Be Used for Temperature Screening](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/infrared-cameras-coronavirus-spread)\n\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, and the world is... \n\n[Read More ](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/infrared-cameras-coronavirus-spread)\n\n[ ](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/34-aws-innovation-with-ici)\n\n## [#34: AWS Innovation with ICI](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/34-aws-innovation-with-ici)\n\nListen on your preferred podcast platform: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and AWS. \n\n[Read More ](https://infraredcameras.com/blog/34-aws-innovation-with-ici)\n\n[](#top)\n"

Safety equipment can be a priceless tool in assessing risks to personnel and ensuring legal compliance. This is where optical gas imaging (OGI) is essential. OGI technology can help you mitigate common plant dangers and hazards. Keep reading to learn more about these types of imaging tools and how they can help you manage safety.\n\n## **Common Dangers**\n\nMany plants must deal with volatile organic compound (VOC) gases that can be hazardous to personnel and the environment. Leaks are not only costly but also a fundamental safety hazard. Methane and natural gas emissions make the news regularly for several reasons. These gases can create long-term health problems. They are flammable and explosive. [Natural gas leaks can kill wildlife](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/natural-gas-leaks-from-pipeline-in-alaskas-cook-inlet/) in surrounding areas and contributes to climate change. These inherent dangers can lead to both reputational and legal repercussions. Naturally, you want to keep these gases in the piping systems, pipelines, wells, and compressor stations as much as possible. This is why leak detection is critical. \n\n## **Why Do Leaks Happen?**\n\nUnderstanding how leaks happen and why mitigating the risk is challenging. Leaks can occur due to old equipment, lack of maintenance, or improper installation. With thousands of flanges, unions, and welded and threaded connections, leaks are difficult to prevent. When they occur, it’s critical to identify and address them as soon as possible, as unidentified risks can create devastating consequences. \n\n## **How Is Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) Used?**\n\nOGI is a means of visualizing gas leaks that are otherwise invisible. It uses an infrared camera with a specialized filter. An OGI camera can visualize multiple hydrocarbon gases, including, but not limited to:\n\n  * Methane\n  * Benzene \n  * Butane\n  * Ammonia\n  * Sulfur dioxide \n\n\n\nOGI technology can be a fast and effective way to detect gas leaks, allowing safety managers to conduct real-time monitoring of potential problem areas.\n\n## **Types of Gas Detection Cameras**\n\nDifferent types of cameras are available to fit individual plant requirements.\n\n### **Handheld Cameras**\n\n[Handheld cameras](/handheld-thermal-camera)can be used for day-to-day monitoring, inspections, and risk assessment. Teams can gain valuable insights that can help determine where and why leaks are occurring. The data compiled creates a highly accurate picture of close to mid-range targets and can be used for reporting and referencing. With built-in WiFi for data streaming, this information can be shared with teams instantly. \n\n### **Remote****Infrared****Systems**\n\nRemote controlled cameras are designed for canvassing large areas. Remote infrared cameras can be operated from the ground and attached to aerial solutions such as drones, small helicopters, or planes. They are self-stabilizing and have a range of 1 to 1.5 miles. Remote controlled cameras are a popular choice for plants that need imaging of the surrounding area or hard-to-reach locations as well as those that have difficulty pinpointing where leaks occur.\n\n### **Fixed Mounted Cameras**\n\nFixed cameras are an excellent choice for regular surveillance and monitoring. They can provide critical data on a given area or fixed points such as highly volatile chambers, including flare towers, thief hatches, and refinery processing units. High definition allows teams to effectively track and trace leakage points. For facility managers, fixed OGI cameras offer a straightforward solution to risk management, providing continuous live data so you can plan effective short- and long-term risk management strategies.\n\nBuilding cameras and sensors that find invisible gas leaks is ICI's number one priority.
