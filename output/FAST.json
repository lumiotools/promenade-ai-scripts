          "content": "Fastenal Company Reports 2024 Third Quarter Earnings\nWINONA, Minn., October 11, 2024 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Fastenal Company (Nasdaq:FAST) (collectively referred to as\n'Fastenal' or by terms such as 'we', 'our', or 'us'), a leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies,\ntoday announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Except for share and per share information, or\nas otherwise noted below, dollar amounts are stated in millions. Throughout this document, percentage and dollar calculations,\nwhich are based on non-rounded dollar values, may not be able to be recalculated using the dollar values included in this\ndocument due to the rounding of those dollar values. References to daily sales rate (DSR) change may reflect either growth\n(positive) or contraction (negative) for the applicable period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, references to 'net earnings',\n'operating and administrative expenses', and 'earnings before income taxes' have been revised in our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and financial reports, including this document, to 'net income', 'selling, general, and administrative\n(SG&A) expenses', and 'income before income taxes', respectively, and are calculated in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nPERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nNine-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nNet sales $ 5,721.5 5,588.1 2.4% $ 1,910.2 1,845.9 3.5%\nBusiness days 192 191 64 63\nDaily sales $ 29.8 29.3 1.9% $ 29.8 29.3 1.9%\nGross profit $ 2,583.7 2,555.1 1.1% $ 858.6 847.6 1.3%\n% of net sales 45.2% 45.7% 44.9% 45.9%\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses $ 1,418.5 1,380.2 2.8% $ 470.5 460.9 2.1%\n% of net sales 24.8% 24.7% 24.6% 25.0%\nOperating income $ 1,165.2 1,174.9 -0.8% $ 388.1 386.7 0.4%\n% of net sales 20.4% 21.0% 20.3% 21.0%\nIncome before income taxes $ 1,163.8 1,167.8 -0.3% $ 387.6 385.4 0.6%\n% of net sales 20.3% 20.9% 20.3% 20.9%\nNet income $ 888.5 888.6 0.0% $ 298.1 295.5 0.9%\nDiluted net income per share $ 1.55 1.55 -0.2% $ 0.52 0.52 0.7%\nNote – Daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days (in the United\nStates) in the period.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSales\nNet sales increased $64.2, or 3.5%, in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. There was one\nmore selling day in the third quarter of 2024 relative to the prior year period and, taking this into consideration, our net daily\nsales increased 1.9% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. We estimate the disruption from\nHurricane Helene to operations and logistics within our Southeast and Atlantic Coastal regions reduced our daily sales by 5 to\n25 basis points in the third quarter of 2024. Changes in foreign exchange rates negatively affected sales in both the third quarter\nof 2024 and the third quarter of 2023 by approximately 10 basis points.\nAn increase in unit sales in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to growth with larger customers and Onsite locations\nopened in the last two years. The impact of product pricing on net sales in the third quarter of 2024 was not material, in\ncontrast to the third quarter of 2023, when the impact of product pricing was modestly positive. The pricing environment was\nstable throughout the third quarter of 2024.\n1\nFrom a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners [including fasteners used in original equipment manufacturing\n(OEM) and maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO)], safety supplies, and other product lines, the latter of which includes\neight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and cutting tools. We continued to experience a divergence\nin the performance of our fastener versus our non-fastener product lines in the third quarter of 2024, which we believe\nprimarily relates to two factors. First, fasteners are more heavily oriented toward production of final goods than maintenance,\nwhich results in greater susceptibility to periods of weaker industrial production. Second, we continued to experience relatively\nfaster growth with warehousing customers due to market share gains and product mix, which primarily benefits our safety\nproduct line. This impact is beginning to moderate as we come up against more difficult comparison periods. The DSR change\nwhen compared to the same period in the prior year and the percent of sales in the period were as follows:\nDSR Change % of Sales\nThree-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOEM fasteners -3.1% 2.4% 19.0% 20.0%\nMRO fasteners -5.3% -8.5% 11.2% 12.1%\nTotal fasteners -4.0% -2.0% 30.2% 32.1%\nSafety supplies 6.8% 9.2% 22.5% 21.4%\nOther product lines 3.7% 6.8% 47.3% 46.5%\nTotal non-fasteners 4.7% 7.5% 69.8% 67.9%\nFrom an end market standpoint, we have five categories: heavy manufacturing, other manufacturing, non-residential\nconstruction, reseller, and other, the latter of which includes government/education and transportation/warehousing. Our\nmanufacturing end markets are outperforming primarily due to the relative strength we are experiencing with key account\ncustomers with significant managed spend where our service model and technology is particularly impactful. This\ndisproportionately benefits manufacturing customers. Other end market sales are improving primarily as a result of strength\nwith warehousing customers due to market share gains and product mix. We believe the weakness in our reseller end market\nreflects efforts in many industries to reduce channel inventories. The DSR change when compared to the same period in the\nprior year and the percent of sales in the period were as follows:\nDSR Change % of Sales\nThree-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nHeavy manufacturing 0.7% 9.0% 42.7% 43.2%\nOther manufacturing 6.2% 2.5% 32.4% 31.1%\nTotal manufacturing 3.0% 6.2% 75.1% 74.3%\nNon-residential construction -3.6% -7.2% 8.6% 9.1%\nReseller -11.3% -6.9% 5.1% 5.8%\nOther end markets 5.6% 8.1% 11.2% 10.8%\nTotal non-manufacturing -1.5% -1.3% 24.9% 25.7%\nWe report our customers in two categories: national accounts, which are customers with significant revenue potential and a\nnational, multi-site contract, and non-national accounts, which include large regional customers, small local customers, and\ngovernment customers. We continued to experience a significant divergence in the performance of our national account\ncustomers versus our non-national account customers, which relates to the relative growth of our sales through Onsite locations\nand larger, key accounts. The DSR change when compared to the same period in the prior year and the percent of sales in the\nperiod were as follows:\nDSR Change % of Sales\nThree-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNational accounts 5.6% 8.6% 63.6% 60.8%\nNon-national accounts -4.1% -1.9% 36.4% 39.2%\n2\nGrowth Drivers\n• We signed 93 new Onsite locations (defined as dedicated sales and service provided from within, or in proximity to, the\ncustomer's facility) in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in 302 year-to-date signings of new Onsite locations. We had\n1,986 active sites on September 30, 2024, which represented an increase of 11.7% from September 30, 2023. Daily sales\nthrough our Onsite locations, excluding sales transferred from branches to new Onsites, grew at a low single-digit rate in\nthe third quarter of 2024 over the third quarter of 2023. This growth is due to contributions from Onsites activated and\nimplemented in 2024 and 2023, which more than offset the impact of closures and a decline in revenues from Onsites\nactivated prior to 2023. Our goal for Onsite signings in 2024 remains between 375 to 400, although the lower half of this\nrange seems most likely given the pace of signings through the third quarter of 2024.\n• FMI Technology is comprised of our FASTStock℠ (scanned stocking locations), FASTBin® (infrared, RFID, and scaled\nbins), and FASTVend® (vending devices) offering. FASTStock's fulfillment processing technology is not embedded, is\nrelatively less expensive and highly flexible in application, and delivered using our proprietary mobility technology.\nFASTBin and FASTVend incorporate highly efficient and powerful embedded data tracking and fulfillment processing\ntechnologies. The first statistic is a weighted FMI® measure, which combines the signings and installations of FASTBin\nand FASTVend in a standardized machine equivalent unit (MEU) based on the expected output of each type of device. We\ndo not include FASTStock in this measurement because scanned stocking locations can take many forms, such as bins,\nshelves, cabinets, pallets, etc., that cannot be converted into a standardized MEU. The second statistic is sales through\nFMI Technology, which combines the sales through FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend. A portion of the growth in\nsales experienced by FMI, particularly FASTStock and FASTBin, reflects the migration of products from less efficient\nnon-digital stocking locations to more efficient, digital stocking locations.\nOur goal for weighted FASTBin and FASTVend device signings in 2024 remains between 26,000 to 28,000 MEUs.\nThe table below summarizes the signings and installations of, and sales through, our FMI devices.\nNine-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend signings\n(MEUs) 21,194 18,664 13.6% 7,281 5,969 22.0%\nSignings per day 110 98 114 95\nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend installations\n(MEUs; end of period) 123,193 110,191 11.8%\nFASTStock sales $ 728.9 708.6 2.9% $ 244.7 234.2 4.5%\n% of sales 12.6% 12.5% 12.7% 12.5%\nFASTBin/FASTVend sales $ 1,710.7 1,550.6 10.3% $ 586.8 526.2 11.5%\n% of sales 29.5% 27.4% 30.3% 28.2%\nFMI sales $ 2,439.6 2,259.2 8.0% $ 831.5 760.4 9.3%\nFMI daily sales $ 12.7 11.8 7.4% $ 13.0 12.1 7.6%\n% of sales 42.1% 39.9% 43.0% 40.7%\n• Our eBusiness includes eProcurement activities [e.g., integrated transactions, including electronic data interchange (EDI)]\nand eCommerce (transactional website sales). Growth of our eBusiness reflects both new sales that enhance our growth\nrate and a shift in existing sales from non-digital to digital processes that improves efficiency. Daily sales through\neBusiness grew 25.6% in the third quarter of 2024 and represented 30.1% of our total sales in the period. In the third\nquarter of 2024, daily sales through eProcurement and eCommerce grew 33.2% and 6.6%, respectively.\nOur digital products and services are comprised of sales through FMI (FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend) plus that\nproportion of our eBusiness sales that do not represent billings of FMI services (collectively, our Digital Footprint). We believe\nthe data that is created through our digital capabilities enhances product visibility, traceability, and control that reduces risk in\noperations and creates ordering and fulfillment efficiencies for both us and our customers. As a result, we believe our\nopportunity to grow our business will be enhanced through the continued development and expansion of our digital\ncapabilities.\nOur Digital Footprint in the third quarter of 2024 represented 61.1% of our sales, an increase from 57.1% of sales in the third\nquarter of 2023.\n3\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 44.9% in the third quarter of 2024 from 45.9% in the third quarter of\n2023. Our gross profit percentage was primarily impacted by four factors. First, we experienced unfavorable customer and\nproduct mix. This reflects relatively stronger growth from large customers, including Onsite customers, and non-fastener\nproducts, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. Second, we experienced\nhigher import duties particularly related to Mexico. Third, we received a large shipper rebate in the third quarter of 2023 that\ndid not recur in the third quarter of 2024. Fourth, supplier rebates were lower, as weaker demand resulted in lower purchasing\nfor products affected by such programs than originally anticipated. Price-cost did not meaningfully impact our gross profit\npercentage during the third quarter of 2024.\nSG&A Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.6% in the third quarter of 2024 versus 25.0% in the third quarter of\n2023. The combined effects of one extra selling day in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and\nefforts to control costs in light of soft underlying business activity resulted in total SG&A expenses in the period increasing\n2.1%, which was below our rate of net sales growth.\nEmployee-related expenses, which represent 70% to 75% of total SG&A expenses, increased 3.5% in the third quarter of 2024\ncompared to the third quarter of 2023. We experienced an increase in employee base pay, due to higher average FTE and\nhigher average wages during the period, as well as higher health insurance costs. This was partly offset by lower bonus and\ncommission payments reflecting slower sales and profit growth versus the third quarter of 2023.\nOccupancy-related expenses, which represent 15% to 20% of total SG&A expenses, increased 4.1% in the third quarter of\n2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. This was primarily a result of modest increases in a number of areas, including\ngeneral inflation in branch costs, incremental depreciation and other costs associated with hub investments and upgrades, and\nhigher utility costs.\nCombined, all other SG&A expenses, which represent 10% to 15% of total SG&A expenses, decreased 8.4% in the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our largest cost categories, information technology (IT) expenses and\nselling-related transportation costs, were relatively stable, with the latter experiencing lower fuel expenses that were mostly\noffset by slightly higher lease costs. As a result, the reduction in all other SG&A expenses reflects the accumulation of small\nchanges in a number of areas, such as an increase in supplier marketing credits, lower bad debt expense, and a decline in\ngeneral insurance costs.\nOperating Income\nOur operating income, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 20.3% in the third quarter of 2024 from 21.0% in the third\nquarter of 2023.\nNet Interest\nWe had net interest expense of $0.5 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net interest expense of $1.3 in the third quarter of\n2023. We had slightly higher interest income reflecting higher rates earned on our cash balances and slightly lower interest\nexpense as a result of lower average borrowings through the third quarter of 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $89.5 in the third quarter of 2024, or 23.1% of income before income taxes. Income tax\nexpense was $89.9 in the third quarter of 2023, or 23.4% of income before income taxes. We believe our ongoing tax rate,\nabsent any discrete tax items or broader changes to tax law, will be approximately 24.5%. Our tax rate in the third quarter of\n2024 was below our expected ongoing tax rate due to the tax benefits associated with (1) the exercise of stock options during\nthe period and (2) return to provision adjustments processed in the quarter.\nNet Income\nOur net income during the third quarter of 2024 was $298.1, an increase of 0.9% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our\ndiluted net income per share was $0.52 in the third quarter of 2024, which was unchanged from $0.52 in the third quarter of\n2023.\n4\nBALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $296.9 in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 23.5% from the third quarter of\n2023, representing 99.6% of the period's net income versus 131.3% in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in operating cash\nflow, as a percent of net income, primarily reflects our operating assets and liabilities being a significant use of cash in the third\nquarter of 2024 as compared to a significant source of cash in the third quarter of 2023. This was primarily attributable to\ninventory, which swung to a use of cash in the third quarter of 2024 versus a source of cash in the third quarter of 2023.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $890.5 in the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of 17.4% from the first nine\nmonths of 2023, representing 100.2% of the period's net income versus 121.4% in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease\nin operating cash flow, as a percent of net income, was driven by the same variables as the third quarter of 2024, primarily\nattributable to inventory shifting to a use of cash in the first nine months of 2024 versus a significant source of cash in the first\nnine months of 2023.\nThe dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable as of September 30, 2024\nwhen compared to September 30, 2023 were as follows:\nTwelve-month Twelve-month\nSeptember 30 Dollar Change Percentage Change\n2024 2023 2024 2024\nAccounts receivable, net $ 1,200.6 1,171.0 $ 29.7 2.5%\nInventories 1,559.5 1,513.8 45.7 3.0%\nTrade working capital $ 2,760.1 2,684.8 $ 75.4 2.8%\nAccounts payable $ 301.7 275.1 $ 26.5 9.6%\nTrade working capital, net $ 2,458.4 2,409.7 $ 48.8 2.0%\nNet sales in last three months $ 1,910.2 1,845.9 $ 64.2 3.5%\nNote - Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nThe increase in our accounts receivable balance in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to two factors. First, our\nreceivables increased as a result of growth in sales to our customers. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our mix due\nto relatively stronger growth from national account customers, which tend to carry longer payment terms than our non-national\naccount customers.\nThe increase in our inventory balance in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to two factors. First, our inventory\nincreased as a result of growth in sales to our customers. Second, we began to add stock intended to improve service to our in-\nmarket locations and generate efficiencies in our hubs. We expect to add $30.0 to $35.0 of inventory, primarily imported\nfasteners, to support these initiatives, of which approximately 80% was added in the third quarter of 2024. These factors more\nthan offset the effects of soft underlying business activity and modest product cost deflation.\nThe increase in our accounts payable balance in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in our\nproduct purchases to support the addition of inventory intended to improve service to our in-market locations and generate\nefficiencies in our hubs.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, our investment in property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales, was $55.8, which was\nan increase from $42.9 in the third quarter of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, our investment in property and\nequipment, net of proceeds from sales, was $156.7, which was an increase from $127.7 in the first nine months of 2023. This\nwas primarily related to two factors. First, spending on FMI was higher based on strong signings and installations, particularly\nof higher-end and higher-cost vending devices. Second, we have had an increase in spending for facility construction and\nupgrades.\nFor the full year of 2024, we expect our investment in property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales, to be within a range\nof $235.0 to $255.0, an increase from $160.6 in 2023. The expected growth on a year-to-year basis is based on spending to\ncomplete our Utah distribution center, investments in picking technology and equipment in our hubs and branches, higher\noutlays for FMI hardware reflecting our higher targeted signings and a mix of more expensive machines, and an increase in\nspending on IT.\n5\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we returned $223.4 to our shareholders in the form of dividends, compared to the third quarter\nof 2023 when we returned $199.8 to our shareholders in the form of dividends. During the first nine months of 2024, we\nreturned $669.9 to our shareholders in the form of dividends, compared to the first nine months of 2023 when we returned\n$599.5 to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We did not repurchase any of our common stock in the first nine months\nof 2024 or 2023.\nTotal debt on our balance sheet was $240.0 at the end of the third quarter of 2024, or 6.3% of total capital (the sum of\nstockholders' equity and total debt). This compares to $260.0, or 7.0% of total capital, at the end of the third quarter of 2023.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThe table below summarizes our absolute and full time equivalent (FTE; based on 40 hours per week) employee headcount, our\ninvestments related to in-market locations (defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of\nactive Onsite locations), and weighted FMI devices at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to\nthe end of the prior periods.\nChange Change Change\nSince: Since: Since:\nQ3 Q2 Q2 Q4 Q4 Q3 Q3\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023\nSelling personnel - absolute employee headcount 16,666 16,774 -0.6 % 16,512 0.9% 16,261 2.5 %\nSelling personnel - FTE employee headcount 15,080 15,386 -2.0 % 15,070 0.1% 14,750 2.2 %\nTotal personnel - absolute employee headcount 23,518 23,629 -0.5 % 23,201 1.4% 22,862 2.9 %\nTotal personnel - FTE employee headcount 20,894 21,249 -1.7 % 20,721 0.8% 20,284 3.0 %\nNumber of branch locations 1,597 1,599 -0.1 % 1,597 —% 1,615 -1.1 %\nNumber of active Onsite locations 1,986 1,934 2.7 % 1,822 9.0% 1,778 11.7 %\nNumber of in-market locations 3,583 3,533 1.4 % 3,419 4.8% 3,393 5.6 %\nWeighted FMI devices (MEU installed count) 123,193 119,306 3.3 % 113,138 8.9% 110,191 11.8 %\nDuring the last twelve months, we increased our total FTE employee headcount by 610. This reflects an increase in our total\nFTE selling and sales support personnel of 330, which is oriented heavily toward supporting expansion of our Onsite locations.\nWe had an increase in our distribution and transportation FTE personnel of 167 to support increased product throughput at our\ndistribution facilities. We had an increase in our remaining FTE personnel of 113 which relates primarily to personnel\ninvestments in IT and business analytics.\nThe table below summarizes the number of branches opened and closed, net of conversions, as well as the number of Onsites\nactivated and closed, net of conversions during the periods presented.\nNine-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBranch openings 7 8 4 3\nBranch closures, net of conversions (7) (76) (6) (23)\nOnsite activations 268 252 93 79\nOnsite closures, net of conversions (104) (97) (41) (29)\nOur in-market network forms the foundation of our business strategy. In recent years, we have seen a gradual increase in our\nin-market locations. This has reflected significant growth in Onsites and, to a lesser degree, international branches, which has\nmore than overcome a meaningful decline in our traditional branch network from a strategic rationalization that aligned our\nphysical footprint with changes in our business strategies. Branch closures may occur in the future to reflect normal churn in\nour business, but the strategic rationalization has concluded. As a result, we expect to see an increase in the rate of in-market\nlocation growth as we continue to open Onsites while our traditional branch network remains stable or grows moderately to\nsustain and improve our North American network, to continue our global expansion beyond North America, and to support our\ngrowth drivers.\n6\nCONFERENCE CALL TO DISCUSS QUARTERLY RESULTS\nAs we previously disclosed, we will host a conference call today to review the quarterly results, as well as current\noperations.

We continue to balance tight cost\n50%\nmanagement and investing to support growth. At this\npoint, we believe margin pressure is a by-product of\n45.9% 45.9%\n44.9% slow growth, not an indication of ineffective expense\n45%\ncontrol.\n• Gross margin declined to 44.9% from 45.9% in 3Q23.\n40% This was impacted by product/customer mix, higher\nimport fees, the absence of a shipper rebate we\nrealized in 3Q23, and a reduction in supplier rebates.\n35% Price/cost did not materially affect gross margin.\n1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24\n• SG&A costs were 24.6% of sales from 25.0% in 3Q23.\nLeverage benefited from one extra sales day and an\nOperating Income Margin\nincrease in supplier marketing credits.\n24%\n• SG&A costs were +2.1% in 3Q24 and +2.8% year-to-\ndate. We will continue to tighten where possible, but\n22%\n21.0% 21.0% invest where prudent. For example, while average\n20.3% FTE in 3Q24 was +2.8%, excluding additions for\n20%\nOnsites, IT, and Business Analytics, our average FTE\nwas +1.0%, trailing sales. Also, while 3Q24 sales-\n18% related travel spending was the highest of the year,\nspending on non-sales travel and supplies was at its\nlowest of the year and -8.7% from 3Q23.\n16%\n6\n1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24\n6\n3Q24 CASH FLOW PROFILE\nOperating Cash Flow\n• 3Q24 operating cash flow was $296.9, or 99.6% of net\n(in millions)\nincome, below 3Q23 (131.3%). The process of rightsizing\n131.3%\n400\ninventory post-supply chain crisis has concluded, as has\n350\nthe outsized cash generation that came with it, even as\n99.6%\n300 we begin to make targeted investments in inventory.\n90.6%\n250\n• Accounts receivable rose 2.5% from 3Q23 to support\n200\ncustomer growth and as a result of a continued shift in\n150\nour sales mix toward larger customers.

We expect 2024 net capital spending to be\nbetween $235.0 to $255.0, a significant increase over the\n60 55.8\nprior year reflecting greater spending on FMI devices and\n$44.4 $42.9 facility construction and upgrades. We are trending to the\n40\nvery low end of the range, however, as certain spending,\nnotably of IT, has begun to get pushed into 2025.\n20\n• We returned $223.4 of capital to shareholders through\n0 dividends in 3Q24 versus $199.8 in 3Q23.\n1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 4Q24\nNet Capital Expenditures = Property & Equipment, net of Proceeds from Sales • Balance sheet debt was 6.3% of total capital in 3Q24,\n2024(E) Net CapEx: $235.0 to $255.0; 2023(A) Net CapEx: $160.6 versus 7.0% in 3Q23 and 7.2% in 4Q23.\n7\nAPPENDIX\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe appendix includes information on our Return on Invested Capital ('ROIC'), which is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure. We define ROIC as net operating profit less income tax expense divided by\naverage invested capital over the trailing 12 months. We believe ROIC is a useful financial measure\nfor evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital and believe ROIC is an important\ndriver of shareholder return over the long-term. Our method of determining ROIC may differ from the\nmethods of other companies, and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other\ncompanies. Management does not use ROIC for any purpose other than the reasons stated above.\nROIC is a measure of performance not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States, and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, GAAP reported measures.\nThe tables that follow on page 9 include a reconciliation of the calculation of our return on total assets\n('ROA') (which is the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure) to the calculation of our\nROIC for the periods presented.\n8\nRETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL*\nCalculation of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Reconciliation of ROIC to Return on Assets (ROA)\nTTM TTM TTM TTM\n(Amounts in millions) 3Q24 3Q23 (Amounts in millions) 3Q24 3Q23\nOperating Income $ 1,519.1 1,507.8 Net Income $ 1,154.9 1,134.2\nIncome Tax Expense (363.2) (361.7) Total Assets $ 4,667.5 4,612.0\nNet Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT) $ 1,155.9 1,146.1 ROA 24.7% 24.6%\nTotal Current Assets $ 3,204.1 3,171.6 NOPAT $ 1,155.9 1,146.1\nCash and Cash Equivalents (294.9) (264.5) Add: Income Tax Expense 363.2 361.7\nAccounts Payable (288.4) (276.2) Operating Income 1,519.1 1,507.8\nAccrued Expenses (230.8) (259.1) Add: Interest Income 6.5 2.1\nProperty & Equipment, Net 1,028.0 1,010.1 Subtract: Interest Expense (7.5) (14.0)\nOther Assets 435.5 430.3 Subtract: Income Tax Expense (363.2) (361.7)\nInvested Capital $ 3,853.5 3,812.2 Net Income $ 1,154.9 1,134.2\nInvested Capital $ 3,853.5 3,812.2\nROIC 30.0% 30.1%\nAdd: Cash and Cash Equivalents 294.9 264.5\nAdd: Accounts Payable 288.4 276.2\nAdd: Accrued Expenses 230.8 259.1\nTotal Assets $ 4,667.5 4,612.0\n* Amounts may not foot due to rounding differences.\n9\nSEQUENTIAL TRENDS*\nCum.

information and where otherwise noted)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(1) Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Fastenal Company and subsidiaries (collectively\nreferred to as 'Fastenal' or by terms such as 'we', 'our', or 'us') have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information. They do not include all information and footnotes required by\nU.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. However, except as described herein, there has been no material change in the\ninformation disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our consolidated financial statements as of\nand for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring\naccruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, references to 'net earnings', 'operating and administrative expenses', and 'earnings before\nincome taxes' have been revised in our condensed consolidated financial statements and financial reports, including this\nquarterly report on Form 10-Q, to 'net income', 'selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses', and 'income before\nincome taxes', respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances reporting requirements\nunder Topic 280. The enhanced disclosure requirements include: title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker\n(CODM), significant segment expenses provided to the CODM, extending certain annual disclosures to interim periods,\nclarifying single reportable segment entities must apply Accounting Standards Codification 280 in its entirety, and permitting\nmore than one measure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain circumstances. This change is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This change will apply\nretrospectively to all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have on\nour consolidated financial statements and disclosures and plan to adopt the standard in our 2024 annual report on Form 10-K.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which establishes\nnew income tax disclosure requirements in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. The new\nguidance requires consistent categorization and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, as well as\nfurther disaggregation of income taxes paid. This change is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.\nThis change will apply on a prospective basis to annual financial statements for periods beginning after the effective date.\nHowever, retrospective application in all prior periods presented is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the\nadoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures and we anticipate adoption in our\n2025 annual report on Form 10-K.\n(2) Revenue\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales include products and shipping and handling charges, net of estimates for product returns and any related sales\nincentives. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products. All\nrevenue is recognized when or as we satisfy our performance obligations under the contract. We recognize revenue by\ntransferring control of the promised products to the customer, with the majority of revenue recognized at the point in time the\ncustomer obtains control of the products. We recognize revenue for shipping and handling charges at the time the products are\ndelivered to or picked up by the customer. We estimate product returns based on historical return rates. Using probability\nassessments, we estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the contract. The majority of our contracts have a\nsingle performance obligation and are short-term in nature. Sales taxes and value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions that are\ncollected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded\nfrom net sales.\n6\nTable of Contents\nFASTENAL COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Amounts in millions except share and per share information and where otherwise noted)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nRevenues are attributable to countries based on the selling location from which the sale occurred.

Generally, each option will\nterminate approximately 10 years after the grant date.\nThe fair value of each share-based option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation method that uses the\nassumptions listed above. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life of the option at the\ntime of grant. The expected life is the average length of time over which we expect the employee groups will exercise their\noptions, net of forfeitures, which is based on historical experience with similar grants. The dividend yield is estimated over the\nexpected life of the option based on our current dividend payout, historical dividends paid, and expected future cash dividends.\nExpected stock volatilities are based on the movement of our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the\nexpected life of the option.\nCompensation expense equal to the grant date fair value is recognized for all of these awards over the vesting period. The stock-\nbased compensation expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $6.0 and $5.6, respectively,\nwhile the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was $2.0 and $1.8, respectively. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense\nrelated to outstanding unvested stock options as of September 30, 2024 was $20.9 and is expected to be recognized over a\nweighted average period of 4.25 years. Any future changes in estimated forfeitures will impact this amount.\nIncome Per Share\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the denominators used in the computation of basic and diluted income per share\nand a summary of the options to purchase shares of common stock which were excluded from the diluted income per share\ncalculation because they were anti-dilutive:\nNine-month Period Three-month Period\nReconciliation 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 572,551,276 571,145,110 572,735,205 571,368,442\nWeighted shares assumed upon exercise of stock options 1,584,650 1,726,310 1,448,456 1,731,267\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 574,135,926 572,871,420 574,183,661 573,099,709\nNine-month Period Three-month Period\nSummary of Anti-dilutive Options Excluded 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOptions to purchase shares of common stock 1,230,831 1,831,551 1,227,996 1,598,463\nWeighted average exercise prices of options $ 63.18 53.05 $ 63.19 53.65\nAny dilutive impact summarized above related to periods when the average market price of our stock exceeded the exercise\nprice of the potentially dilutive stock options then outstanding.\n9\nTable of Contents\nFASTENAL COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Amounts in millions except share and per share information and where otherwise noted)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\n(4) Income Taxes\nWe file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, all states, and various local and foreign jurisdictions. We are\nno longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for taxable years before 2021 in the case of United States\nfederal examinations, and with limited exception, before 2018 in the case of foreign, state, and local examinations. During the\nfirst nine months of 2024, there were no material changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\n(5) Operating Leases\nCertain operating leases for pick-up trucks contain residual value guarantee provisions which would generally become due at\nthe expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value.\nThe aggregate residual value guarantee related to these leases was approximately $134.3. We believe the likelihood of funding\nthe guarantee obligation under any provision of the operating lease agreements is remote.\n(6) Debt Commitments\nCredit Facility, Notes Payable, and Commitments\nDebt obligations and letters of credit outstanding at the end of each period consisted of the following:\nAverage Debt Outstanding\nInterest Rate at\nSeptember 30, Maturity September 30, December 31,\n2024 Date 2024 2023\nUnsecured revolving credit facility 5.88% September 28, 2027 $ 40.0 —\nSenior unsecured promissory notes payable, Series C 3.22% March 1, 2024 — 60.0\nSenior unsecured promissory notes payable, Series D 2.66% May 15, 2025 75.0 75.0\nSenior unsecured promissory notes payable, Series E 2.72% May 15, 2027 50.0 50.0\nSenior unsecured promissory notes payable, Series G 2.13% June 24, 2026 25.0 25.0\nSenior unsecured promissory notes payable, Series H 2.50% June 24, 2030 50.0 50.0\nTotal 240.0 260.0\nLess: Current portion of debt (115.0) (60.0)\nLong-term debt $ 125.0 200.0\nOutstanding letters of credit under unsecured revolving credit\nfacility - contingent obligation $ 31.2 32.7\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nWe have an $835.0 committed unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) with an uncommitted accordion option to\nincrease the aggregate revolving commitment by an additional $365.0 for a total amount of $1,200.0. The Credit Facility\nincludes a committed letter of credit subfacility of $55.0. Any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility for which we\nhave the ability and intent to pay using cash within the next 12 months will be classified as a current liability. The Credit\nFacility contains certain financial and other covenants, and our right to borrow under the Credit Facility is conditioned upon,\namong other things, our compliance with these covenants. We are currently in compliance with these covenants.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus a 0.10%\nspread adjustment plus 0.95%. We pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the Credit Facility. This fee is either 0.10%\nor 0.125% per annum based on our usage of the Credit Facility.\n10\nTable of Contents\nFASTENAL COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Amounts in millions except share and per share information and where otherwise noted)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n(Unaudited)\nSenior Unsecured Promissory Notes Payable\nWe have issued senior unsecured promissory notes under our master note agreement (the Master Note Agreement) in the\naggregate principal amount of $200.0 as of September 30, 2024. Our aggregate borrowing capacity under the Master Note\nAgreement is $900.0; however, none of the institutional investors party to that agreement are committed to purchase notes\nthereunder. There is no amortization of these notes prior to their maturity date and interest is payable quarterly. The notes\ncurrently issued under our Master Note Agreement, including the maturity date and fixed interest rate per annum of each series\nof note, are contained in the table above. The Master Note Agreement contains certain financial and other covenants and we are\ncurrently in compliance with these covenants.\n(7) Legal Contingencies\nThe nature of our potential exposure to legal contingencies is described in our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K in Note 10 of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024, there were no litigation matters that we consider to\nbe probable or reasonably possible to have a material adverse outcome.\n(8) Subsequent Events\nWe evaluated all subsequent event activity and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require\nrecognition in the condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements, with the exception of the dividend declaration disclosed in Note 3 'Stockholders' Equity'.\n11\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2 — MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position\nand operating results during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and should\nbe read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements. Dollar amounts are stated in millions except for\nshare and per share amounts and where otherwise noted. Throughout this document, percentage and dollar change calculations,\nwhich are based on non-rounded dollar values, may not be able to be recalculated using the dollar values in this document due\nto the rounding of those dollar values. References to daily sales rate (DSR) change may reflect either growth (positive) or\ncontraction (negative) for the applicable period.\nBusiness\nFastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these\nsupplies through a network of more than 3,500 in-market locations. Our largest end market is manufacturing. Sales to these\ncustomers include products for both original equipment manufacturing (OEM), where our products are consumed in the final\nproducts of our customers, and manufacturing, repair, and operations (MRO), where our products are consumed to support the\nfacilities and ongoing operations of our customers. We also service general and commercial contractors in non-residential end\nmarkets as well as farmers, truckers, railroads, oil exploration companies, oil production and refinement companies, mining\ncompanies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our branches,\nOnsite locations, and customers are primarily located in North America, though we continue to grow our non-North American\npresence as well.\nOur motto is Growth Through Customer Service® and our tagline is Where Industry Meets Innovation™. We are a customer-\nand growth-centric organization focused on identifying unique technologies, capabilities, and supply chain solutions that get us\ncloser to our customers and reduce the total cost of their global supply chain. We believe this close-to-the-customer, 'high-\ntouch, high-tech' partnership approach is differentiated in the marketplace and allows us to gain market share in what remains a\nfragmented industrial distribution market.\nExecutive Overview\nThe following table presents a performance summary of our results of operations for the nine- and three-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNine-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nNet sales $ 5,721.5 5,588.1 2.4% $ 1,910.2 1,845.9 3.5%\nBusiness days 192 191 64 63\nDaily sales $ 29.8 29.3 1.9% $ 29.8 29.3 1.9%\nGross profit $ 2,583.7 2,555.1 1.1% $ 858.6 847.6 1.3%\n% of net sales 45.2% 45.7% 44.9% 45.9%\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses $ 1,418.5 1,380.2 2.8% $ 470.5 460.9 2.1%\n% of net sales 24.8% 24.7% 24.6% 25.0%\nOperating income $ 1,165.2 1,174.9 -0.8% $ 388.1 386.7 0.4%\n% of net sales 20.4% 21.0% 20.3% 21.0%\nIncome before income taxes $ 1,163.8 1,167.8 -0.3% $ 387.6 385.4 0.6%\n% of net sales 20.3% 20.9% 20.3% 20.9%\nNet income $ 888.5 888.6 0.0% $ 298.1 295.5 0.9%\nDiluted net income per share $ 1.55 1.55 -0.2% $ 0.52 0.52 0.7%\nNote – Daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days (in the United\nStates) in the period.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes our absolute and full time equivalent (FTE; based on 40 hours per week) employee headcount, our\ninvestments related to in-market locations (defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of\nactive Onsite locations), and weighted Fastenal Managed Inventory (FMI) devices at the end of the periods presented and the\npercentage change compared to the end of the prior periods.\nChange Change Change\nSince: Since: Since:\nQ3 Q2 Q2 Q4 Q4 Q3 Q3\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023\nSelling personnel - absolute employee headcount 16,666 16,774 -0.6 % 16,512 0.9 % 16,261 2.5 %\nSelling personnel - FTE employee headcount 15,080 15,386 -2.0 % 15,070 0.1 % 14,750 2.2 %\nTotal personnel - absolute employee headcount 23,518 23,629 -0.5 % 23,201 1.4 % 22,862 2.9 %\nTotal personnel - FTE employee headcount 20,894 21,249 -1.7 % 20,721 0.8 % 20,284 3.0 %\nNumber of branch locations 1,597 1,599 -0.1 % 1,597 — % 1,615 -1.1 %\nNumber of active Onsite locations 1,986 1,934 2.7 % 1,822 9.0 % 1,778 11.7 %\nNumber of in-market locations 3,583 3,533 1.4 % 3,419 4.8 % 3,393 5.6 %\nWeighted FMI devices (MEU installed count) 123,193 119,306 3.3 % 113,138 8.9 % 110,191 11.8 %\nDuring the last twelve months, we increased our total FTE employee headcount by 610. This reflects an increase in our total\nFTE selling and sales support personnel of 330, which is oriented heavily toward supporting expansion of our Onsite locations.\nWe had an increase in our distribution and transportation FTE personnel of 167 to support increased product throughput at our\ndistribution facilities. We had an increase in our remaining FTE personnel of 113 which relates primarily to personnel\ninvestments in IT and business analytics.\nThe table below summarizes the number of branches opened and closed, net of conversions, as well as the number of Onsites\nactivated and closed, net of conversions during the periods presented.\nNine-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBranch openings 7 8 4 3\nBranch closures, net of conversions (7) (76) (6) (23)\nOnsite activations 268 252 93 79\nOnsite closures, net of conversions (104) (97) (41) (29)\nOur in-market network forms the foundation of our business strategy. In recent years, we have seen a gradual increase in our in-\nmarket locations. This has reflected significant growth in Onsites and, to a lesser degree, international branches, which has\nmore than overcome a meaningful decline in our traditional branch network from a strategic rationalization that aligned our\nphysical footprint with changes in our business strategies. Branch closures may occur in the future to reflect normal churn in\nour business, but the strategic rationalization has concluded. As a result, we expect to see an increase in the rate of in-market\nlocation growth as we continue to open Onsites while our traditional branch network remains stable or grows moderately to\nsustain and improve our North American network, to continue our global expansion beyond North America, and to support our\ngrowth drivers.\n13\nTable of Contents\nTHIRD QUARTER OF 2024 VERSUS THIRD QUARTER OF 2023\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth condensed consolidated statements of income information (as a percentage of net sales) for the\nperiods ended September 30:\nThree-month Period\n2024 2023\nNet sales 100.0 % 100.0 %\nGross profit 44.9 % 45.9 %\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 24.6 % 25.0 %\nOperating income 20.3 % 21.0 %\nNet interest expense 0.0 % -0.1 %\nIncome before income taxes 20.3 % 20.9 %\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales\nThe table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended September 30, and changes in such sales from the prior\nperiod to the more recent period:\nThree-month Period\n2024 2023\nNet sales $ 1,910.2 1,845.9\nPercentage change 3.5% 2.4%\nBusiness days 64 63\nDaily sales $ 29.8 29.3\nPercentage change 1.9% 4.0%\nDaily sales impact of currency fluctuations -0.1% -0.1%\nNet sales increased $64.2, or 3.5%, in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. There was one\nmore selling day in the third quarter of 2024 relative to the prior year period and, taking this into consideration, our net daily\nsales increased 1.9% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. We estimate the disruption from\nHurricane Helene to operations and logistics within our Southeast and Atlantic Coastal regions reduced our daily sales by 5 to\n25 basis points in the third quarter of 2024. Changes in foreign exchange rates negatively affected sales in both the third quarter\nof 2024 and the third quarter of 2023 by approximately 10 basis points.\nAn increase in unit sales in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to growth with larger customers and Onsite locations\nopened in the last two years. The impact of product pricing on net sales in the third quarter of 2024 was not material, in contrast\nto the third quarter of 2023, when the impact of product pricing was modestly positive. The pricing environment was stable\nthroughout the third quarter of 2024.\n14\nTable of Contents\nFrom a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners (including fasteners used in OEM and MRO), safety supplies,\nand other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and\ncutting tools. We continued to experience a divergence in the performance of our fastener versus our non-fastener product lines\nin the third quarter of 2024, which we believe primarily relates to two factors. First, fasteners are more heavily oriented toward\nproduction of final goods than maintenance, which results in greater susceptibility to periods of weaker industrial production.\nSecond, we continued to experience relatively faster growth with warehousing customers due to market share gains and product\nmix, which primarily benefits our safety product line. This impact is beginning to moderate as we come up against more\ndifficult comparison periods. The DSR change when compared to the same period in the prior year and the percent of sales in\nthe period were as follows:\nDSR Change % of Sales\nThree-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOEM fasteners -3.1% 2.4% 19.0% 20.0%\nMRO fasteners -5.3% -8.5% 11.2% 12.1%\nTotal fasteners -4.0% -2.0% 30.2% 32.1%\nSafety supplies 6.8% 9.2% 22.5% 21.4%\nOther product lines 3.7% 6.8% 47.3% 46.5%\nTotal non-fasteners 4.7% 7.5% 69.8% 67.9%\nFrom an end market standpoint, we have five categories: heavy manufacturing, other manufacturing, non-residential\nconstruction, reseller, and other, the latter of which includes government/education and transportation/warehousing. Our\nmanufacturing end markets are outperforming primarily due to the relative strength we are experiencing with key account\ncustomers with significant managed spend where our service model and technology is particularly impactful. This\ndisproportionately benefits manufacturing customers. Other end market sales are improving primarily as a result of strength\nwith warehousing customers due to market share gains and product mix. We believe the weakness in our reseller end market\nreflects efforts in many industries to reduce channel inventories. The DSR change when compared to the same period in the\nprior year and the percent of sales in the period were as follows:\nDSR Change % of Sales\nThree-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nHeavy manufacturing 0.7 % 9.0 % 42.7 % 43.2 %\nOther manufacturing 6.2 % 2.5 % 32.4 % 31.1 %\nTotal manufacturing 3.0 % 6.2 % 75.1 % 74.3 %\nNon-residential construction -3.6 % -7.2 % 8.6 % 9.1 %\nReseller -11.3 % -6.9 % 5.1 % 5.8 %\nOther end markets 5.6 % 8.1 % 11.2 % 10.8 %\nTotal non-manufacturing -1.5 % -1.3 % 24.9 % 25.7 %\nWe report our customers in two categories: national accounts, which are customers with significant revenue potential and a\nnational, multi-site contract, and non-national accounts, which include large regional customers, small local customers, and\ngovernment customers. We continued to experience a significant divergence in the performance of our national account\ncustomers versus our non-national account customers, which relates to the relative growth of our sales through Onsite locations\nand larger, key accounts. The DSR change when compared to the same period in the prior year and the percent of sales in the\nperiod were as follows:\nDSR Change % of Sales\nThree-month Period Three-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNational accounts 5.6% 8.6% 63.6% 60.8%\nNon-national accounts -4.1% -1.9% 36.4% 39.2%\n15\nTable of Contents\nGrowth Drivers\n• We signed 93 new Onsite locations (defined as dedicated sales and service provided from within, or in proximity to, the\ncustomer's facility) in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in 302 year-to-date signings of new Onsite locations. We had\n1,986 active sites on September 30, 2024, which represented an increase of 11.7% from September 30, 2023. Daily sales\nthrough our Onsite locations, excluding sales transferred from branches to new Onsites, grew at a low single-digit rate in\nthe third quarter of 2024 over the third quarter of 2023. This growth is due to contributions from Onsites activated and\nimplemented in 2024 and 2023, which more than offset the impact of closures and a decline in revenues from Onsites\nactivated prior to 2023. Our goal for Onsite signings in 2024 remains between 375 to 400, although the lower half of this\nrange seems most likely given the pace of signings through the third quarter of 2024.\n• FMI Technology is comprised of our FASTStock℠ (scanned stocking locations), FASTBin® (infrared, RFID, and scaled\nbins), and FASTVend® (vending devices) offering. FASTStock's fulfillment processing technology is not embedded, is\nrelatively less expensive and highly flexible in application, and delivered using our proprietary mobility technology.\nFASTBin and FASTVend incorporate highly efficient and powerful embedded data tracking and fulfillment processing\ntechnologies. The first statistic is a weighted FMI® measure, which combines the signings and installations of FASTBin\nand FASTVend in a standardized machine equivalent unit (MEU) based on the expected output of each type of device. We\ndo not include FASTStock in this measurement because scanned stocking locations can take many forms, such as bins,\nshelves, cabinets, pallets, etc., that cannot be converted into a standardized MEU. The second statistic is sales through\nFMI Technology, which combines the sales through FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend. A portion of the growth in\nsales experienced by FMI, particularly FASTStock and FASTBin, reflects the migration of products from less efficient\nnon-digital stocking locations to more efficient, digital stocking locations.\nOur goal for weighted FASTBin and FASTVend device signings in 2024 remains between 26,000 to 28,000 MEUs.\nThe table below summarizes the signings and installations of, and sales through, our FMI devices.\nThree-month Period\n2024 2023 Change\nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend signings (MEUs) 7,281 5,969 22.0%\nSignings per day 114 95\nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend installations (MEUs; end of period) 123,193 110,191 11.8%\nFASTStock sales $ 244.7 234.2 4.5%\n% of sales 12.7% 12.5%\nFASTBin/FASTVend sales $ 586.8 526.2 11.5%\n% of sales 30.3% 28.2%\nFMI sales $ 831.5 760.4 9.3%\nFMI daily sales $ 13.0 12.1 7.6%\n% of sales 43.0% 40.7%\n• Our eBusiness includes eProcurement activities [e.g., integrated transactions, including electronic data interchange (EDI)]\nand eCommerce (transactional website sales). Growth of our eBusiness reflects both new sales that enhance our growth rate\nand a shift in existing sales from non-digital to digital processes that improves efficiency. Daily sales through eBusiness\ngrew 25.6% in the third quarter of 2024 and represented 30.1% of our total sales in the period. In the third quarter of 2024,\ndaily sales through eProcurement and eCommerce grew 33.2% and 6.6%, respectively.\nOur digital products and services are comprised of sales through FMI (FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend) plus that\nproportion of our eBusiness sales that do not represent billings of FMI services (collectively, our Digital Footprint). We believe\nthe data that is created through our digital capabilities enhances product visibility, traceability, and control that reduces risk in\noperations and creates ordering and fulfillment efficiencies for both us and our customers. As a result, we believe our\nopportunity to grow our business will be enhanced through the continued development and expansion of our digital capabilities.\nOur Digital Footprint in the third quarter of 2024 represented 61.1% of our sales, an increase from 57.1% of sales in the third\nquarter of 2023.\n16\nTable of Contents\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 44.9% in the third quarter of 2024 from 45.9% in the third quarter of\n2023. Our gross profit percentage was primarily impacted by four factors. First, we experienced unfavorable customer and\nproduct mix. This reflects relatively stronger growth from large customers, including Onsite customers, and non-fastener\nproducts, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. Second, we experienced\nhigher import duties particularly related to Mexico. Third, we received a large shipper rebate in the third quarter of 2023 that\ndid not recur in the third quarter of 2024. Fourth, supplier rebates were lower, as weaker demand resulted in lower purchasing\nfor products affected by such programs than originally anticipated. Price-cost did not meaningfully impact our gross profit\npercentage during the third quarter of 2024.\nSG&A Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.6% in the third quarter of 2024 versus 25.0% in the third quarter of\n2023. The combined effects of one extra selling day in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and\nefforts to control costs in light of soft underlying business activity resulted in total SG&A expenses in the period increasing\n2.1%, which was below our rate of net sales growth.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other SG&A expenses compared to the same period in\nthe preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nThree-month Period\nApproximate Percentage of\nTotal SG&A Expenses 2024\nEmployee-related expenses 70% to 75% 3.5%\nOccupancy-related expenses 15% to 20% 4.1%\nAll other SG&A expenses 10% to 15% -8.4%\nEmployee-related expenses include: (1) payroll (which includes cash compensation, stock option expense, and profit sharing),\n(2) health care, (3) personnel development, and (4) social taxes.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, our employee-related expenses increased when compared to the third quarter of 2023. We\nexperienced an increase in employee base pay, due to higher average FTE and higher average wages during the period, as well\nas higher health insurance costs. This was partly offset by lower bonus and commission payments reflecting slower sales and\nprofit growth versus the third quarter of 2023.\nThe table below summarizes our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the\nend of the prior periods:\nChange Change\nSince: Since:\nQ3 Q2 Q2 Q3 Q3\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nSelling personnel (1) 15,080 15,386 -2.0 % 14,750 2.2 %\nDistribution/Transportation personnel 3,151 3,172 -0.7 % 2,984 5.6 %\nManufacturing personnel 714 721 -1.0 % 704 1.4 %\nOrganizational support personnel (2) 1,949 1,970 -1.1 % 1,846 5.6 %\nTotal personnel 20,894 21,249 -1.7 % 20,284 3.0 %\n(1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location.\n(2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (35% to 40% of category),\nwhich includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) Information Technology (IT) personnel\n(35% to 40% of category); and (3) Administrative Support personnel (22% to 27% of category), which includes human\nresources, Fastenal School of Business, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nOccupancy-related expenses include: (1) building rent and depreciation, (2) building utility costs, (3) equipment related to our\nbranches and distribution locations, and (4) industrial vending equipment and bins utilized as part of FMI services (we consider\nthis hardware to be a logical extension of our in-market operations and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy\nexpenses).\nIn the third quarter of 2024, our occupancy-related expenses increased when compared to the third quarter of 2023. This was\nprimarily a result of modest increases in a number of areas, including general inflation in branch costs, incremental depreciation\nand other costs associated with hub investments and upgrades, and higher utility costs.\n17\nTable of Contents\nAll other SG&A expenses include: (1) selling-related transportation, (2) IT expenses, (3) general corporate expenses, which\nconsist of legal expenses, general insurance expenses, travel and marketing expenses, etc., and (4) sales of property and\nequipment.\nCombined, all other SG&A expenses decreased in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our\nlargest cost categories, IT expenses and selling-related transportation costs, were relatively stable, with the latter experiencing\nlower fuel expenses that were mostly offset by slightly higher lease costs. As a result, the reduction in all other SG&A expenses\nreflects the accumulation of small changes in a number of areas, such as an increase in supplier marketing credits, lower bad\ndebt expense, and a decline in general insurance costs.\nOperating Income\nOur operating income, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 20.3% in the third quarter of 2024 from 21.0% in the third\nquarter of 2023.\nNet Interest\nWe had net interest expense of $0.5 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net interest expense of $1.3 in the third quarter of\n2023. We had slightly higher interest income reflecting higher rates earned on our cash balances and slightly lower interest\nexpense as a result of lower average borrowings through the third quarter of 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $89.5 in the third quarter of 2024, or 23.1% of income before income taxes. Income tax\nexpense was $89.9 in the third quarter of 2023, or 23.4% of income before income taxes. We believe our ongoing tax rate,\nabsent any discrete tax items or broader changes to tax law, will be approximately 24.5%. Our tax rate in the third quarter of\n2024 was below our expected ongoing tax rate due to the tax benefits associated with (1) the exercise of stock options during\nthe period and (2) return to provision adjustments processed in the quarter.\nNet Income\nOur net income during the third quarter of 2024 was $298.1, an increase of 0.9% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our\ndiluted net income per share was $0.52 in the third quarter of 2024, which was unchanged from $0.52 in the third quarter of\n2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash flow activity was as follows for the periods ended September 30:\nThree-month Period\n2024 2023 Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 296.9 388.1 -23.5%\nPercentage of net income 99.6% 131.3%\nNet cash used in investing activities $ 55.9 43.0 30.0%\nPercentage of net income 18.8% 14.6%\nNet cash used in financing activities $ 210.7 286.9 -26.6%\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $91.2 in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of\n2023. The decrease in operating cash flow, as a percent of net income, primarily reflects our operating assets and liabilities\nbeing a significant use of cash in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a significant source of cash in the third quarter of\n2023. This was primarily attributable to inventory, which swung to a use of cash in the third quarter of 2024 versus a source of\ncash in the third quarter of 2023.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe dollar and percentage change in accounts receivable, net, inventories, and accounts payable as of September 30, 2024 when\ncompared to September 30, 2023 were as follows:\nTwelve-month Twelve-month\nSeptember 30 Dollar Change Percentage Change\n2024 2023 2024 2024\nAccounts receivable, net $ 1,200.6 1,171.0 $ 29.7 2.5 %\nInventories 1,559.5 1,513.8 45.7 3.0 %\nTrade working capital $ 2,760.1 2,684.8 $ 75.4 2.8 %\nAccounts payable $ 301.7 275.1 $ 26.5 9.6 %\nTrade working capital, net $ 2,458.4 2,409.7 $ 48.8 2.0 %\nNet sales in last three months $ 1,910.2 1,845.9 $ 64.2 3.5 %\nNote - Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nThe increase in our accounts receivable balance in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to two factors. First, our\nreceivables increased as a result of growth in sales to our customers. Second, we continue to experience a shift in our mix due\nto relatively stronger growth from national account customers, which tend to carry longer payment terms than our non-national\naccount customers.\nThe increase in our inventory balance in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to two factors. First, our inventory\nincreased as a result of growth in sales to our customers. Second, we began to add stock intended to improve service to our in-\nmarket locations and generate efficiencies in our hubs. We expect to add $30.0 to $35.0 of inventory, primarily imported\nfasteners, to support these initiatives, of which approximately 80% was added in the third quarter of 2024. These factors more\nthan offset the effects of soft underlying business activity and modest product cost deflation.\nThe increase in our accounts payable balance in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in our\nproduct purchases to support the addition of inventory intended to improve service to our in-market locations and generate\nefficiencies in our hubs.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $12.9 in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nThis was due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of\n2023.\nOur capital spending typically falls into five categories: (1) purchases related to FMI hardware, (2) purchases of property and\nequipment related to expansion of and enhancements to distribution centers, owned or leased branch properties, and other\ncompany facilities, (3) spending on software and hardware for our information processing systems, (4) the addition of fleet\nvehicles, and (5) the addition of manufacturing equipment. Proceeds from the sales of property and equipment, typically for the\nplanned disposition of pick-up trucks as well as distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business, are netted\nagainst these purchases and additions. During the third quarter of 2024, our net capital expenditures (purchases of property and\nequipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment) were $55.8, which was an increase from $42.9 in the third\nquarter of 2023.\nCash requirements for capital expenditures were satisfied from cash generated from operations, available cash and cash\nequivalents, our borrowing capacity, and the proceeds of disposals. For the full year of 2024, we expect our net capital\nexpenditures to be within a range of $235.0 to $255.0, an increase from $160.6 in 2023. The expected growth on a year-to-year\nbasis is based on spending to complete our Utah distribution center, investments in picking technology and equipment in our\nhubs and branches, higher outlays for FMI hardware reflecting our higher targeted signings and a mix of more expensive\nmachines, and an increase in spending on IT.\n19\nTable of Contents\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $76.2 in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. In\nthe third quarter of 2023, we had higher average borrowings outstanding and were using capital to reduce those balances. In\ncontrast, in the third quarter of 2024, we had lower average borrowings and a smaller proportion of those balances were part of\na facility that was eligible for repayment. As a result, we used significantly less capital to reduce debt balances in the third\nquarter of 2024 relative to the third quarter of 2023. This was partly offset by an increase in capital returned to shareholders\nthrough dividends in the period.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we returned $223.4 to our shareholders in the form of dividends, compared to the third quarter\nof 2023 when we returned $199.8 to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We did not repurchase any of our common stock\nin the third quarter of 2024 or 2023.\nWe have authority to purchase up to 6,200,000 additional shares of our common stock under the July 12, 2022 authorization.\nThis authorization does not have an expiration date.\nTotal debt on our balance sheet was $240.0 at the end of the third quarter of 2024, or 6.3% of total capital (the sum of\nstockholders' equity and total debt). This compares to $260.0, or 7.0% of total capital, at the end of the third quarter of 2023.\nThe reduction in debt in the third quarter of 2024 versus the prior period reflects strong generation of net cash provided by\noperating activities over the last 12 months in excess of what was necessary to finance net capital expenditures, payment of\ndividends, and other investing and financing cash needs.\nOur material cash requirements for known contractual obligations include capital expenditures, debt, and lease obligations, each\nof which are discussed in more detail earlier in this report in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and in\nour 2023 annual report on Form 10-K.\nAn overview of our cash dividends paid or declared in 2024 and 2023 is contained in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n20\nTable of Contents\nNINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 VERSUS NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth condensed consolidated statements of income information (as a percentage of net sales) for the\nperiods ended September 30:\nNine-month Period\n2024 2023\nNet sales 100.0 % 100.0 %\nGross profit 45.2 % 45.7 %\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 24.8 % 24.7 %\nOperating income 20.4 % 21.0 %\nNet interest expense 0.0 % -0.1 %\nIncome before income taxes 20.3 % 20.9 %\nNote – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.\nSales\nThe table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended September 30, and changes in such sales from the prior\nperiod to the more recent period:\nNine-month Period\n2024 2023\nNet sales $ 5,721.5 5,588.1\nPercentage change 2.4% 5.7%\nBusiness days 192 191\nDaily sales $ 29.8 29.3\nPercentage Change 1.9% 6.3%\nDaily sales impact of currency fluctuations -0.1% -0.4%\nNet sales increased $133.4, or 2.4%, in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the first nine months of 2023. The\neffect of adverse weather in the first nine months of 2024 was a reduction in sales by 10 to 30 basis points. Changes in foreign\nexchange rates negatively affected sales in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 by approximately 10 and 40 basis points,\nrespectively.\nUnit sales increased in the first nine months of 2024, which contributed to the increase in net sales in the period. This was\nprimarily due to growth with large customers, both those operating out of Onsite locations that have been opened in the last two\nyears and, to a lesser degree, those being serviced from traditional branch operations. The impact of product pricing on net sales\nin the first nine months of 2024 was a decline of 10 to 40 basis points, compared to the first nine months of 2023, which\nexperienced an increase of 190 to 220 basis points. The decline reflects lower fastener pricing, as well as lower pricing in\ncertain safety categories. Incremental pricing actions taken over the past twelve months have been modest in scope, resulting in\nmostly stable price levels throughout the first nine months of 2024.\n21\nTable of Contents\nFrom a product standpoint, we have three categories: fasteners (including fasteners used in OEM and MRO), safety supplies,\nand other product lines, the latter of which includes eight smaller product categories, such as tools, janitorial supplies, and\ncutting tools. In the first nine months of 2024, we continued to experience a divergence in the performance of our fastener\nversus our non-fastener product lines, which we believe primarily relates to three factors. First, fasteners are more heavily\noriented toward production of final goods than maintenance, which results in greater susceptibility to periods of weaker\nindustrial production. Second, pricing for fasteners has decelerated at a faster pace than non-fastener products. Third, we\ncontinued to experience relatively faster growth with warehousing customers due to market share gains and product mix, which\nprimarily benefits our safety product line. This impact is beginning to moderate as we come up against more difficult\ncomparison periods. The DSR change when compared to the same period in the prior year and the percent of sales in the period\nwere as follows:\nDSR Change % of Sales\nNine-month Period Nine-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOEM fasteners -3.1% 6.3% 19.4% 20.4%\nMRO fasteners -5.0% -5.3% 11.5% 12.4%\nTotal fasteners -3.8% 1.6% 30.9% 32.8%\nSafety supplies 7.4% 7.6% 22.0% 20.8%\nOther product lines 3.5% 9.6% 47.1% 46.4%\nTotal non-fasteners 4.7% 9.0% 69.1% 67.2%\nFrom an end market standpoint, we have five categories: heavy manufacturing, other manufacturing, non-residential\nconstruction, reseller, and other, the latter of which includes government/education and transportation/warehousing. Our\nmanufacturing end markets are outperforming primarily due to the relative strength we are experiencing with key account\ncustomers with significant managed spend where our service model and technology is particularly impactful. This\ndisproportionately benefits manufacturing customers. Other end market sales are improving primarily as a result of strength\nwith warehousing customers due to market share gains and product mix. We believe the weakness in our reseller end market, at\nleast in the latter part of the nine-month period, reflects efforts in many industries to reduce channel inventories. The DSR\nchange when compared to the same period in the prior year and the percent of sales in the period were as follows:\nDSR Change % of Sales\nNine-month Period Nine-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nHeavy manufacturing 1.7% 13.1% 43.2% 43.2%\nOther manufacturing 4.2% 6.5% 32.0% 31.4%\nTotal manufacturing 2.8% 10.2% 75.2% 74.6%\nNon-residential construction -5.2% -6.2% 8.6% 9.2%\nReseller -6.7% -7.1% 5.4% 5.9%\nOther end markets 6.4% 1.5% 10.8% 10.3%\nTotal non-manufacturing -0.8% -3.4% 24.8% 25.4%\nWe report our customers in two categories: national accounts, which are customers with significant revenue potential and a\nnational, multi-site contract, and non-national accounts, which include large regional customers, small local customers, and\ngovernment customers. We continued to experience a significant divergence in the performance of our national account\ncustomers versus our non-national account customers, which relates to the relative growth of our sales through Onsite locations\nand larger, key accounts. The DSR change when compared to the same period in the prior year and the percent of sales in the\nperiod were as follows:\nDSR Change % of Sales\nNine-month Period Nine-month Period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNational accounts 5.9% 10.8% 62.7% 59.8%\nNon-national accounts -4.3% 0.6% 37.3% 40.2%\n22\nTable of Contents\nGrowth Drivers\nThe table below summarizes the signings and installations of, and sales through, our FMI devices.\nNine-month Period\n2024 2023 Change\nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend signings (MEUs) 21,194 18,664 13.6%\nSignings per day 110 98\nWeighted FASTBin/FASTVend installations (MEUs; end of period) 123,193 110,191 11.8%\nFASTStock sales $ 728.9 708.6 2.9%\n% of sales 12.6% 12.5%\nFASTBin/FASTVend sales $ 1,710.7 1,550.6 10.3%\n% of sales 29.5% 27.4%\nFMI sales $ 2,439.6 2,259.2 8.0%\nFMI daily sales $ 12.7 11.8 7.4%\n% of sales 42.1% 39.9%\nDaily sales through eBusiness grew 27.9% in the first nine months of 2024 and represented 29.1% of our total sales in the\nperiod. In the first nine months of 2024, daily sales through eProcurement and eCommerce grew 33.3% and 13.9%,\nrespectively.\nOur Digital Footprint in the first nine months of 2024 represented 59.9% of our sales, an increase from 55.5% of sales in the\nfirst nine months of 2023.\nGross Profit\nIn the first nine months of 2024, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, declined to 45.2% from 45.7% in the first nine\nmonths of 2023. The largest factor behind the decline in our gross profit percentage in the first nine months of 2024 was\ncustomer and product mix. We continued to experience relatively strong growth from Onsite customers and non-fastener\nproducts, each of which tend to have a lower gross profit percentage than our business as a whole. We also experienced higher\nimport duties, particularly related to Mexico as a result of significant increases in duty fees instituted in that country over the\npast 13 months. These adverse impacts were partly offset by slightly favorable price-cost and slightly favorable leverage of\norganizational/overhead costs through the first nine months of 2024. The latter was primarily due to greater utilization of\ndomestic transportation resources as we move more product to support current stocking levels.\nSG&A Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 24.8% in the first nine months of 2024 from 24.7% in the first\nnine months of 2023. Efforts to control growth in operating expenses in the first nine months of 2024 produced a modest 2.8%\nexpansion of total SG&A expenses in the period. Notwithstanding this, growth in net sales was below growth in SG&A\nexpenses, resulting in our slight deleveraging of costs in the first nine months of 2024.\nThe percentage change in employee-related, occupancy-related, and all other SG&A expenses compared to the same period in\nthe preceding year, is outlined in the table below.\nNine-month Period\nApproximate Percentage of\nTotal SG&A Expenses 2024\nEmployee-related expenses 70% to 75% 3.3%\nOccupancy-related expenses 15% to 20% 1.3%\nAll other SG&A expenses 10% to 15% 1.7%\n23\nTable of Contents\nIn the first nine months of 2024, our employee-related expenses increased when compared to the first nine months of 2023. We\nexperienced an increase in employee base pay due to higher average FTE and average wages during the period, as well as\nhigher healthcare costs. This was partly offset by a decrease in bonus and commission payments reflecting the impact of slower\nsales and profit growth versus the prior year.\nThe table below summarizes our FTE headcount at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the\nend of the prior period:\nChange\nSince:\nQ3 Q4 Q4\n2024 2023 2023\nSelling personnel (1) 15,080 15,070 0.1%\nDistribution/Transportation personnel 3,151 3,095 1.8%\nManufacturing personnel 714 697 2.4%\nOrganizational support personnel (2) 1,949 1,859 4.8%\nTotal personnel 20,894 20,721 0.8%\n(1) Of our Selling Personnel, 80%-85% are attached to a specific in-market location.\n(2) Organizational support personnel consists of: (1) Sales & Growth Driver Support personnel (35% to 40% of category),\nwhich includes sourcing, purchasing, supply chain, product development, etc.; (2) IT personnel (35% to 40% of category);\nand (3) Administrative Support personnel (22% to 27% of category), which includes human resources, Fastenal School of\nBusiness, accounting and finance, senior management, etc.\nIn the first nine months of 2024, our occupancy-related expenses increased when compared to the first nine months of 2023. We\nhad moderate increases in branch costs related to general inflation, as well as non-branch expenses from incremental\ndepreciation and other costs associated with hub investments and upgrades. This was partly offset by lower FMI expense where\nthe roll-off of depreciation on a large number of vending devices that had reached the end of their depreciable lives in the first\nnine months of 2023 more than offset higher depreciation resulting from growth in bins.\nCombined, all other SG&A expenses increased in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the first nine months of\n2023. This reflects a number of items. We experienced higher lease costs in our selling-related vehicle fleet due to an increase\nin the mix of larger truck types and higher prices on newer vehicles. We incurred higher expenses related to our Customer Expo\nas a result of the event being larger than we had originally expected. We also saw a modest increase in IT spending and general\ninsurance costs.\nOperating Income\nOur operating income, as a percentage of net sales, declined to 20.4% in the first nine months of 2024 from 21.0% in the first\nnine months of 2023.\nNet Interest\nOur net interest expense was $1.4 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to net interest expense of $7.1 in the first nine\nmonths of 2023. We had higher interest income reflecting higher rates earned on our cash balances. We had lower interest\nexpense, reflecting lower average borrowings through the first nine months of 2024, partly offset by slightly higher rates paid\non our debt balances.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $275.3 in the first nine months of 2024, or 23.7% of income before income taxes. Income\ntax expense was $279.2 in the first nine months of 2023, or 23.9% of income before income taxes. We believe our ongoing tax\nrate, absent any discrete tax items or broader changes to tax law, will be approximately 24.5%. Our tax rate in the first nine\nmonths of 2024 was below our expected ongoing tax rate due to (1) the tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock\noptions during the period and (2) return to provision adjustments processed in the third quarter of 2024.\nNet Income\nOur net income during the first nine months of 2024 was $888.5, which was approximately flat compared to the first nine\nmonths of 2023. Our diluted net income per share was $1.55 in the first nine months of 2024, which was unchanged from $1.55\nin the first nine months of 2023.\n24\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash flow activity was as follows for the periods ended September 30:\nNine-month Period\n2024 2023 Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 890.5 1,078.7 -17.4%\nPercentage of net income 100.2% 121.4%\nNet cash used in investing activities $ 157.0 128.2 22.5%\nPercentage of net income 17.7% 14.4%\nNet cash used in financing activities $ 663.6 879.1 -24.5%\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $188.2 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the first nine\nmonths of 2023. The decrease in operating cash flow, as a percent of net income, was driven by the same variables as the third\nquarter of 2024, primarily attributable to inventory shifting to a use of cash in the first nine months of 2024 versus a significant\nsource of cash in the first nine months of 2023.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $28.8 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the first nine months of\n2023. This was primarily due to an increase in net capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 compared to in the first\nnine months of 2023.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, our net capital expenditures were $156.7, which was an increase from $127.7 in the first\nnine months of 2023. This was primarily related to two factors. First, spending on FMI was higher based on strong signings and\ninstallations, particularly of higher-end and higher-cost vending devices. Second, we have had an increase in spending for\nfacility construction and upgrades.\nFor the full year of 2024, we expect our net capital expenditures to be within a range of $235.0 to $255.0, an increase from\n$160.6 in 2023. The expected growth on a year-to-year basis is based on spending to complete our Utah distribution center,\ninvestments in picking technology and equipment in our hubs and branches, higher outlays for FMI hardware reflecting our\nhigher targeted signings and a mix of more expensive machines, and an increase in spending on IT.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $215.5 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the first nine months\nof 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, we had average borrowings outstanding and were using capital to reduce those\nbalances. In contrast, in the first nine months of 2023, we had lower average borrowings and a smaller proportion of those\nbalances were part of a facility that was eligible for repayment. As a result, we used significantly less capital to reduce debt\nbalances in the first nine months of 2024 relative to the first nine months of 2023. This was partly offset by an increase in\ncapital returned to shareholders through dividends in the period.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, we returned $669.9 to our shareholders in the form of dividends, compared to the first\nnine months of 2023 when we returned $599.5 to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We did not repurchase any of our\ncommon stock in the first nine months of 2024 or 2023.\n25\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates – A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is contained in our\n2023 annual report on Form 10-K.

Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our income and cash\nflows. We evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows:\nImport shipping costs – We import a significant quantity of our products, particularly fasteners and private label products,\nfrom foreign suppliers, primarily in Asia. As a result, we incur costs related to shipping charges, duties, harbor fees, and sundry\nother expenses involved in the movement of product for sale in North America and our other global locations. These costs are\nembedded in our product values, and significant fluctuations can affect our product gross profit depending on what mitigating\nactions might be taken. The most significant contributor to these fluctuations is the cost of overseas shipping containers,\nalthough the timing of any impact can be affected by the length of our supply chain, contractually agreed upon rates, or\ndifferences in rates between routes. We estimate the effect on our net income related to import shipping costs was a favorable\n$14.0 to $18.0 in the first nine months of 2024.\nCommodity steel prices – We buy and sell various types of steel products; these products consist primarily of different types\nof fasteners and related hardware. We are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass\nthrough the impacts to our end customers. During the first nine months of 2024, the price of steel as reflected in many market\nindexes most relevant to our business was at or slightly below the prior year period. Due to our long supply chain, changes in\nthe cost of steel can take a number of quarters to be reflected in our financial results. Further, the cost of the raw material is\ngenerally a small part of the total value of the steel products that we sell, which can also diminish the impact of cost changes for\nthe raw material. We estimate the effect on our net income related to commodity steel prices was immaterial in the first nine\nmonths of 2024.\nCommodity energy prices – We have market risk for changes in prices of oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity,\nlargely due to our consumption of fuel in our vehicles and utility-generated electricity at our facilities. As reflected in many\nmarket indexes, energy prices during the first nine months of 2024 were below the prior year period. Total direct fuel\nconsumption is a relatively minor cost to us and, as a result, we estimate the effect on our net income related to commodity\nenergy prices was immaterial in the first nine months of 2024.\nFossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that\nwe sell. During the first nine months of 2024, prices for fossil fuels were generally at or slightly below the prior year period.\nThe cost of the raw material is generally a small part of the total value of the products that we sell, which can diminish the\nimpact of cost changes for the raw material. As a result, we estimate the effect on our net income related to materials for which\nfossil fuels are a feedstock was immaterial in the first nine months of 2024.\nForeign currency exchange rates – Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments, our operations in countries\nother than the U.S., and income denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary exchange rate exposure has traditionally been\nwith the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar, and we have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given\nthat exposure to date has not been material. Changes in foreign exchange rates were immaterial for the first nine months of\n2024.\nInterest rates - Loans under our Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates. As a result, changes in such rates can affect our\noperating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place. We have not\nhistorically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our Credit Facility. A one percentage\npoint increase to our floating rate debt in the first nine months of 2024 would have resulted in approximately $0.2 of additional\ninterest expense. A description of our Credit Facility is contained in Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nITEM 4 — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures – As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an\nevaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of\nour disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n(the Securities Exchange Act)). Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in\nreports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the\ntime periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding\ndisclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting – There was no change in our internal control over financial\nreporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n27\nTable of Contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nA description of our legal proceedings, if any, is contained in Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements.
