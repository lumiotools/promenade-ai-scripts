(“Stryve” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: SNAX), an emerging healthy snacking platform and leader in the air-dried meat snack industry in the United States, today reports financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company reported continued revenue growth, improved gross margins, and reduced operating expenses, highlighting the effectiveness of its transformation strategy.\n\nKey highlights include net sales of $5.7 million, reflecting a 36.4% increase from the third quarter of 2023, and more than doubling gross profit year over year with a gross margin of 21.7%, as compared to 13.3% in the prior-year period.\n\n**Q3 2024 – Momentum Continues with Expanded Distribution and Enhanced Financial Performance**\n\nStryve’s transformation continued in the third quarter of 2024, delivering year-over-year improvements in gross margin, lower operating expenses, and a narrowed Adjusted EBITDA loss. The Company’s focus on profitable growth, operational efficiency, and cost discipline is yielding results. Stryve’s expanded retail presence includes key wins with BJ’s Wholesale, Wawa, Circle K, and others, reflecting strong demand for its air-dried meat snack brands. The recent $2.9 million equity raise, alongside strategic partnerships like Dot Foods, aims to provide some relief to the working capital constraints and support the Company’s ongoing transformation efforts.\n\n**Chris Boever, Chief Executive Officer, commented,** “In Q3 2024, Stryve Foods continued to build momentum as we executed our transformation with discipline and focus. Our achievements in expanding distribution and driving margin improvements demonstrate the power of our strategy and our team’s commitment. We’re excited about our progress as we strengthen Stryve’s position in the healthy protein snacking category. The initiatives we’ve implemented provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth and profitability in the quarters to come.”\n\n**Recent Business Updates and Strategic Initiatives**\n\n  * **Distribution Expansion** : Building on Q2’s momentum, Stryve successfully secured new placements across major retailers, including BJ’s Wholesale, Wawa, Circle K, and other prominent grocery and convenience channels​​. Additionally, the Company has just secured new chainwide distribution with a leading retailer that will feature its products in thousands of new locations beginning in Q1 2025.\n\n\n  * **Streamlining Operations** : The Company’s recently announced a strategic partnership with Dot Foods that will further enhance its distribution reach nationwide, beginning in Q4’24. This partnership will help to streamline Stryve’s distribution and fulfillment operations and enhance service levels for the Company’s retail partners nationwide.\n\n\n  * **New Product Launch - High Steaks** : Stryve launched High Steaks, a high-protein, human-grade pet treat brand, in response to strong consumer demand for clean-label pet snacks​. This new product line reinforces the Company’s commitment to growth through innovation and category expansion.\n\n\n  * **Capital Raise** : In November 2024, the Company raised $2.9 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity through a public offering, providing additional working capital to support Stryve’s increased order volume and run rate demand​. The Company sold 3,670,886 shares of its Class A common stock and common stock equivalents and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,341,722 shares of its Class A common stock at a combined public offering price of $0.79 per share (or prefunded warrant) and associated common warrants. Each share of Class A common stock (or prefunded warrant) was sold together with two warrants each to purchase one share of Class A common stock. The common warrants have an exercise price of $0.79 per share, are exercisable following stockholder approval, and have a term of exercise equal to five years following date of the stockholder approval. The closing of the offering occurred on November 12, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Alex Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer, said,** “We are pleased with our financial progress in the third quarter, highlighted by our improved gross margin and reduced operating expenses year over year. Our recent $2.9 million capital raise will help to restore our service levels and catch up to our run rate demand from existing distribution. We will continue to look for ways to address the inventory build required to support our upcoming distribution expansion in Q1. These expected increased volumes should contribute meaningfully in our efforts to close the gap to profitability. As we look forward, we remain focused on optimizing operations, securing and managing our capital efficiently, and delivering value to our shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales of $5.7 million, up 36.4% as compared to the third quarter a year ago. This is primarily the result of increased consumption of our products at retail by consumers.\n\n\n  * Gross profit of $1.2 million compared to $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, translating to a gross margin of 21.7% versus 13.3% in the prior-year period. This improvement highlights the Company’s focus on productivity and operational efficiency.\n\n\n  * Operating loss of ($2.3) million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of ($3.6) million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Other Expense of $0.8 million, primarily related to interest expenses, down from $1.1 million in the prior-year period.\n\n\n  * Net loss of ($3.1) million, or ($0.95) per share, as compared to a net loss of ($4.8) million, or ($2.14) per share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Adjusted loss per share¹ of ($0.89) in the third quarter of 2024, favorably comparing to an adjusted loss per share of ($1.66) in the prior-year period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss¹ of ($1.7) million for the third quarter of 2024, representing a 31.5% improvement over the ($2.5) million Adjusted EBITDA loss in the prior-year quarter. \n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales of $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, up 11.2% as compared to the comparable period a year ago. The mix of net sales improved year over year in part due to the Company’s discontinuation of certain retail programs, rationalization of low-quality revenue, which included the discontinuation of slow-moving and margin losing items some of which was still present in the prior year period while improved sell-through and growth in quality core accounts more than offset the rationalized revenues so far this year.\n\n\n  * Gross profit of $3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, compared to gross profit of $2.6 million in prior year period. The current year period’s improved performance is primarily attributable to enhanced sales-mix and better utilization of the facilities partially offset by higher commodity costs than in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * Operating loss of ($7.5) million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, as compared to operating loss of ($11.3) million in the prior year period representing a 33.1% improvement.\n\n\n  * Other Expense of $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, is approximately flat compared to $2.5 million in the comparable period a year ago. This is in part attributable to approximately $0.3 million of a non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt in the current year period related to the accounting treatment of the repricing of the warrants connected to the extension of the promissory notes issued on April 19, 2023. The prior year period was burdened by approximately $0.9 million in interest expense related to the accounting treatment of the warrants issued in connection with those same bridge notes issued in April 2023. The remaining difference is primarily attributable to interest expense on new convertible bridge notes put in place during the current year period.\n\n\n  * Net loss of ($10.0) million, or ($3.22) per share for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, as compared to a net loss of ($13.7) million, or ($6.41) per share, in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted loss per share¹ of ($2.87) for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, which compares favorably to adjusted loss per share of ($5.44) for the year-ago period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss¹ of ($5.5) million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, which represents a 34.0% improvement compared to ($8.4) million in the prior year period. \n\n\n\n¹ Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share are a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and reconciled to GAAP below.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

(“Stryve” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: SNAX), an emerging healthy snacking platform and leader in the air-dried meat snack industry in the United States, today reports financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company reported continued revenue growth, improved gross margins, and reduced operating expenses, highlighting the effectiveness of its transformation strategy.\n\nKey highlights include net sales of $5.7 million, reflecting a 36.4% increase from the third quarter of 2023, and more than doubling gross profit year over year with a gross margin of 21.7%, as compared to 13.3% in the prior-year period.\n\n**Q3 2024 – Momentum Continues with Expanded Distribution and Enhanced Financial Performance**\n\nStryve’s transformation continued in the third quarter of 2024, delivering year-over-year improvements in gross margin, lower operating expenses, and a narrowed Adjusted EBITDA loss. The Company’s focus on profitable growth, operational efficiency, and cost discipline is yielding results. Stryve’s expanded retail presence includes key wins with BJ’s Wholesale, Wawa, Circle K, and others, reflecting strong demand for its air-dried meat snack brands. The recent $2.9 million equity raise, alongside strategic partnerships like Dot Foods, aims to provide some relief to the working capital constraints and support the Company’s ongoing transformation efforts.\n\n**Chris Boever, Chief Executive Officer, commented,** “In Q3 2024, Stryve Foods continued to build momentum as we executed our transformation with discipline and focus. Our achievements in expanding distribution and driving margin improvements demonstrate the power of our strategy and our team’s commitment. We’re excited about our progress as we strengthen Stryve’s position in the healthy protein snacking category. The initiatives we’ve implemented provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth and profitability in the quarters to come.”\n\n**Recent Business Updates and Strategic Initiatives**\n\n  * **Distribution Expansion** : Building on Q2’s momentum, Stryve successfully secured new placements across major retailers, including BJ’s Wholesale, Wawa, Circle K, and other prominent grocery and convenience channels​​. Additionally, the Company has just secured new chainwide distribution with a leading retailer that will feature its products in thousands of new locations beginning in Q1 2025.\n\n\n  * **Streamlining Operations** : The Company’s recently announced a strategic partnership with Dot Foods that will further enhance its distribution reach nationwide, beginning in Q4’24. This partnership will help to streamline Stryve’s distribution and fulfillment operations and enhance service levels for the Company’s retail partners nationwide.\n\n\n  * **New Product Launch - High Steaks** : Stryve launched High Steaks, a high-protein, human-grade pet treat brand, in response to strong consumer demand for clean-label pet snacks​. This new product line reinforces the Company’s commitment to growth through innovation and category expansion.\n\n\n  * **Capital Raise** : In November 2024, the Company raised $2.9 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity through a public offering, providing additional working capital to support Stryve’s increased order volume and run rate demand​. The Company sold 3,670,886 shares of its Class A common stock and common stock equivalents and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,341,722 shares of its Class A common stock at a combined public offering price of $0.79 per share (or prefunded warrant) and associated common warrants. Each share of Class A common stock (or prefunded warrant) was sold together with two warrants each to purchase one share of Class A common stock. The common warrants have an exercise price of $0.79 per share, are exercisable following stockholder approval, and have a term of exercise equal to five years following date of the stockholder approval. The closing of the offering occurred on November 12, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Alex Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer, said,** “We are pleased with our financial progress in the third quarter, highlighted by our improved gross margin and reduced operating expenses year over year. Our recent $2.9 million capital raise will help to restore our service levels and catch up to our run rate demand from existing distribution. We will continue to look for ways to address the inventory build required to support our upcoming distribution expansion in Q1. These expected increased volumes should contribute meaningfully in our efforts to close the gap to profitability. As we look forward, we remain focused on optimizing operations, securing and managing our capital efficiently, and delivering value to our shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales of $5.7 million, up 36.4% as compared to the third quarter a year ago. This is primarily the result of increased consumption of our products at retail by consumers.\n\n\n  * Gross profit of $1.2 million compared to $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, translating to a gross margin of 21.7% versus 13.3% in the prior-year period. This improvement highlights the Company’s focus on productivity and operational efficiency.\n\n\n  * Operating loss of ($2.3) million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of ($3.6) million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Other Expense of $0.8 million, primarily related to interest expenses, down from $1.1 million in the prior-year period.\n\n\n  * Net loss of ($3.1) million, or ($0.95) per share, as compared to a net loss of ($4.8) million, or ($2.14) per share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Adjusted loss per share¹ of ($0.89) in the third quarter of 2024, favorably comparing to an adjusted loss per share of ($1.66) in the prior-year period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss¹ of ($1.7) million for the third quarter of 2024, representing a 31.5% improvement over the ($2.5) million Adjusted EBITDA loss in the prior-year quarter. \n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales of $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, up 11.2% as compared to the comparable period a year ago. The mix of net sales improved year over year in part due to the Company’s discontinuation of certain retail programs, rationalization of low-quality revenue, which included the discontinuation of slow-moving and margin losing items some of which was still present in the prior year period while improved sell-through and growth in quality core accounts more than offset the rationalized revenues so far this year.\n\n\n  * Gross profit of $3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, compared to gross profit of $2.6 million in prior year period. The current year period’s improved performance is primarily attributable to enhanced sales-mix and better utilization of the facilities partially offset by higher commodity costs than in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * Operating loss of ($7.5) million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, as compared to operating loss of ($11.3) million in the prior year period representing a 33.1% improvement.\n\n\n  * Other Expense of $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, is approximately flat compared to $2.5 million in the comparable period a year ago. This is in part attributable to approximately $0.3 million of a non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt in the current year period related to the accounting treatment of the repricing of the warrants connected to the extension of the promissory notes issued on April 19, 2023. The prior year period was burdened by approximately $0.9 million in interest expense related to the accounting treatment of the warrants issued in connection with those same bridge notes issued in April 2023. The remaining difference is primarily attributable to interest expense on new convertible bridge notes put in place during the current year period.\n\n\n  * Net loss of ($10.0) million, or ($3.22) per share for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, as compared to a net loss of ($13.7) million, or ($6.41) per share, in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted loss per share¹ of ($2.87) for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, which compares favorably to adjusted loss per share of ($5.44) for the year-ago period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss¹ of ($5.5) million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, which represents a 34.0% improvement compared to ($8.4) million in the prior year period. \n\n\n\n¹ Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share are a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and reconciled to GAAP below.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Information**\n\nStryve uses non-GAAP financial information and believes it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in operating results, and provide additional insight on how the management team evaluates the business. Stryve’s management team uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share to make operating and strategic decisions, evaluate performance and comply with indebtedness related reporting requirements. Below are details on this non-GAAP measure and the non-GAAP adjustments that the management team makes in the definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Share. Stryve believes this non-GAAP measure should be considered along with Net Loss Before Income Taxes, and Net Loss, the most closely related GAAP financial measure. Reconciliation between EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings per Share, Net Loss Before Income Taxes, and Net Loss are below:\n\n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,** |  **Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n_(unaudited)_ | _(unaudited)_  \n**(In thousands)**  \nNet loss before income taxes | $ | (3,110 | ) | $ | (4,772 | ) | $ | (9,990 | ) | $ | (13,733 | )  \nInterest expense | 805 | 1,121 | 2,115 | 2,484  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | 389 | 552 | 1,259 | 1,656  \n**EBITDA** | **$** | **(1,916** | **)** | **$** | **(3,099** | **)** | **$** | **(6,616** | **)** | **$** | **(9,593** | **)**  \nAdditional Adjustments:  \nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt | — | — | 335 | —  \nStock Based Compensation Expense | 192 | 330 | 738 | 948  \nATM Facility Setup Fees/Expenses | — | 93 | — | 93  \nLegacy Product – Maui Relief Donations & Liquidation Sales | — | 157 | — | 157  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | **$** | **(1,724** | **)** | **$** | **(2,518** | **)** | **$** | **(5,543** | **)** | **$** | **(8,395** | **)**  \n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,** |  **Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n_(unaudited)_ | _(unaudited)_  \n**(In thousands except share and per share information)**  \nNet loss | $ | (3,110 | ) | $ | (4,779 | ) | $ | (10,000 | ) | $ | (13,731 | )  \nWeighted average shares outstanding | 3,279,054 | 2,237,211 | 3,103,442 | 2,143,336  \n**Basic & Diluted Net Loss per Share** | **$** | **(0.95** | **)** | **$** | **(2.14** | **)** | **$** | **(3.22** | **)** | **$** | **(6.41** | **)**  \nAdditional Adjustments:  \nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt | — | — | 0.11 | —  \nStock Based Compensation Expense | 0.06 | 0.15 | 0.24 | 0.44  \nNon-Cash Interest Attributable to Warrants Issued in Connection with Notes | — | 0.22 | — | 0.41  \nATM Facility Setup Fees/Expenses | — | 0.04 | — | 0.04  \nLegacy Product – Maui Relief Donations & Liquidation Sales | — | 0.07 | — | 0.07  \n**Adjusted Earnings per Share** | **$** | **(0.89** | **)** | **$** | **(1.66** | **)** | **$** | **(2.87** | **)** | **$** | **(5.44** | **)**  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/9460d79c-df59-4713-9c47-bb2388a97bcd/small/stryve-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9460d79c-df59-4713-9c47-bb2388a97bcd)\n\nSource: Stryve Foods, Inc. \n\nReleased November 13, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.stryve.com/news-events/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n"
