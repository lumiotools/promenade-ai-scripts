(Nasdaq: WVE), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on unlocking the broad potential of RNA medicines to transform human health, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“Since the start of the third quarter, we have delivered positive clinical updates across DMD and AATD, unlocked RNA editing for Wave, and advanced our novel, wholly owned pipeline focused on GalNAc-conjugated programs,” said Paul Bolno, MD, MBA, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wave Life Sciences. “Our achievement of proof-of-mechanism for WVE-006 marked a historic breakthrough for the oligonucleotide field with the first-ever in-human evidence of RNA editing, providing a strong foundation to expand our wholly owned editing pipeline. We are also advancing WVE-007 for obesity and WVE-N531 for DMD towards key milestones in the first quarter. In HD, we are encouraged by a potential path forward to bring the first-ever therapeutic approach that preserves healthy wild-type protein to people living with HD, a devastating disease with limited treatment options. We continue to receive substantial interest on HD, including from potential strategic partners. With the continued demonstration of our novel chemistry in the clinic and cash runway expected into 2027, we are well capitalized and well positioned to deliver multiple value inflection points across our portfolio as we continue to build a leading RNA medicines company.”\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n**GalNAc-RNA editing**** _AATD_**\n\n  * **WVE-006** is a GalNAc-conjugated, subcutaneously delivered, A-to-I RNA editing oligonucleotide (AIMer) that is uniquely designed to address Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-related lung disease, liver disease, or both. WVE-006 does not use a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system.\n  * There are an estimated 200,000 Pi*ZZ patients in the US and Europe. Treatment options are currently limited to weekly IV augmentation therapy for lung disease only (representing over $1 billion in worldwide sales in 2023). There are no approved therapies to address AATD liver disease, which ultimately requires many patients to undergo liver transplantation.\n  * WVE-006 is currently being evaluated in the top dose cohort of RestorAATion-1 (healthy volunteers) and in the first dose cohort of RestorAATion-2 in Pi*ZZ patients with AATD.\n  * In [October](https://ir.wavelifesciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/wave-life-sciences-announces-first-ever-therapeutic-rna-editing), Wave announced positive proof-of-mechanism data from the first single dose cohort with the first two patients to reach day 57 in the ongoing RestorAATion-2 study, representing the first-ever clinical demonstration of RNA editing in humans. Circulating wild-type M-AAT protein in plasma reached a mean of 6.9 micromolar at day 15, representing more than 60% of total AAT. Mean total AAT protein increased from below the level of quantification at baseline to 10.8 micromolar at day 15, meeting the level that has been the basis for regulatory approval for AAT augmentation therapies. Increases in neutrophil elastase inhibition from baseline were consistent with production of functional M-AAT. WVE-006 was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile across both RestorAATion-1 and RestorAATion-2.\n  * **Expected upcoming milestone:** Wave expects to share multidose data from RestorAATion-2 in 2025.\n\n\n\n**_New AIMers_**\n\n  * At [Research Day](https://ir.wavelifesciences.com/events/event-details/wave-life-sciences-virtual-research-day) in October, Wave announced three new, wholly owned RNA editing programs that build on its recent achievement of the first-ever therapeutic RNA editing with WVE-006 in AATD. As with WVE-006, these programs leverage GalNAc conjugation and have efficient clinical paths to proof-of-concept. These new programs include PNPLA3, which aims to use an mRNA correction treatment approach for those at high risk for a variety of liver diseases, and LDLR and APOB which utilize first-in-class mRNA upregulation and mRNA correction treatment approaches (respectively) to achieve target LDL-c levels in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients.\n  * **Expected upcoming milestone:** Wave expects to select clinical candidates for PNPLA3, LDLR and APOB in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Obesity (GalNAc-siRNA)**\n\n  * **WVE-007** is a GalNAc-conjugated small interfering RNA (GalNAc-siRNA) that targets INHBE as a novel approach to treat obesity. The approach is based on human genetics, where individuals who have a protective loss-of-function mutation in the INHBE gene have a healthier cardiometabolic profile, including less unhealthy visceral fat, lower triglycerides, and lower risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n  * At its recent Research Day, Wave shared data supporting WVE-007’s potential to address obesity as a monotherapy, as an add-on to GLP-1s for further improvement of weight loss or to reduce the doses of GLP-1s, and for maintenance to prevent weight regain and weight cycling after discontinuing GLP-1s.\n  * **Expected upcoming milestone:** Wave expects to initiate a clinical trial for WVE-007 in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**HD (allele-selective silencing)**\n\n  * **WVE-003** is a first-in-class, allele-selective oligonucleotide for the treatment of Huntington’s disease (HD). Results of the SELECT-HD clinical trial demonstrated the first-ever allele-selective reductions in CSF mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein and preservation of healthy, wild-type huntingtin (wtHTT) protein with multiple doses of WVE-003, as well as a statistically significant correlation between mHTT reductions and slowing of caudate atrophy. By sparing wtHTT protein, which is critical to the health of the central nervous system, WVE-003 is uniquely positioned to address presymptomatic HD patients, as well as symptomatic patients.\n  * There are currently no disease modifying therapies for HD, which affects over 200,000 individuals across pre-symptomatic and symptomatic disease stages in the US and Europe. WVE-003 is expected to address approximately 40% of the HD population (potential $5 billion commercial opportunity), and up to 80% of patients with HD may be addressed in the future with other SNP-targeted candidates (potential $10 billion commercial opportunity).\n  * At Wave’s recent Research Day, Jeffrey Long, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry and Biostatistics at the University of Iowa, discussed the opportunity for caudate atrophy as a biomarker to expedite clinical development in HD. Dr. Long shared data which supports that the slowing of caudate atrophy predicts significant delays in the loss of function for people living with HD. The potential for changes in caudate volume to predict clinical outcomes in HD and its sensitivity to change early in the disease course makes it an optimal biomarker to enable smaller, more efficient clinical trials.\n  * In November 2024, Wave received supportive initial feedback from FDA, who recognize the severity of HD and are receptive to and engaged with Wave regarding a potential pathway to accelerated approval. FDA is open to Wave’s plan to evaluate biomarkers, including caudate atrophy, as an endpoint to assess HD progression with the potential to predict clinical outcome. Planning is underway for a global, potentially registrational Phase 2/3 study of WVE-003, including finalization of key aspects of design.\n  * In November 2024, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to WVE-003.\n  * **Expected upcoming milestone:** Wave expects to submit an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for WVE-003 in the second half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**DMD (exon skipping)**\n\n  * **WVE-N531** is an exon skipping oligonucleotide designed to induce production of endogenous, functional dystrophin protein for the treatment of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) amenable to exon 53 skipping. In the third quarter, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Orphan Drug Designation to WVE-N531.\n  * In [September](https://ir.wavelifesciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/wave-life-sciences-announces-positive-interim-data-forward-53), Wave announced positive interim data from the Phase 2 FORWARD-53 study of WVE-N531. The interim analysis was conducted after 24 weeks of 10 mg/kg dosing every two weeks. Dystrophin results, from a pre-specified analysis of ambulatory boys, showed mean absolute muscle content-adjusted dystrophin expression was 9.0% (range: 4.6-13.9%) as measured by Western Blot. The dystrophin expression was quantified from two isoforms consistent with those observed in Becker muscular dystrophy patients who display milder disease. 89% of ambulatory participants achieved muscle content-adjusted dystrophin levels of at least 5%. Mean exon skipping was 57% (range: 31-75%) as measured by RT-PCR.\n  * WVE-N531 could address up to 10% of the DMD population, which encompasses over 2,000 boys in the US and Europe. Wave is also advancing a broader DMD pipeline of oligonucleotides for skipping other exons, with the goal of providing new and best-in-class treatment options for up to 40% of boys with DMD. In 2023, exon skipping therapeutics for DMD achieved approximately ~$1 billion in sales, primarily in the US, across exons covering approximately ~29% of the DMD population.\n  * **Expected upcoming milestone:** In the first quarter of 2025, Wave expects to deliver the complete 48-week FORWARD-53 data and receive feedback from regulators on a pathway to accelerated approval.\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $310.9 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $200.4 million as of December 31, 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, Wave received approximately $187.5 million in net proceeds from the upsized September 2024 offering. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2024, on October 1, 2024, Wave received approximately $28.2 million in net proceeds from the September 2024 offering. Wave expects that its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operations into 2027. Potential future milestone and other payments to Wave under its GSK collaboration are not included in its cash runway.\n  * Revenue recognized was ($7.7) million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $49.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included one-time revenue recognition events under our Takeda Collaboration related to the termination of the C9 program and the achievement of a development milestone. The year over year decrease is primarily driven by these one-time events in the prior year period. In addition, under our GSK collaboration, we recorded a non-cash reduction to cumulative revenue in the current period due to a change in the estimate to fulfill the performance obligations in accordance with revenue recognition standards. This adjustment changes the timing of revenue reporting for this program, with no impact on the program’s progress or cash flow.\n  * Research and development expenses were $41.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $31.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. General and administrative expenses were $15.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $13.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net loss was $61.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to net income of $7.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Investor Conference Call and Webcast** Wave will host an investor conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET to review the third quarter 2024 financial results and pipeline updates.
