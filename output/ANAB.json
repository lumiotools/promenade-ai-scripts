The increase in non-cash revenue is due to a $15.0 million commercial milestone earned for annual _Jemperli_ sales exceeding $250.0 million and increased royalties recognized for sales of _Jemperli_.\n  * Research and development expenses were $42.2 million and $121.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $30.9 million and $98.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to development costs for rosnilimab, ANB032, ANB033 and ANB101 offset by a decrease in development costs for imsidolimab. The R&D non-cash, stock-based compensation expense was $4.0 million and $10.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $2.2 million and $7.7 million in the same period in 2023.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $10.6 million and $32.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $10.2 million and $31.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Its pipeline includes two programs targeting co-inhibitory receptors: ANB032, its BTLA agonist, in a Phase 2b trial for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and rosnilimab, its PD-1 agonist, in a Phase 2b trial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and in a Phase 2 trial for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. It also has other antibodies in its portfolio, including ANB033, an anti-CD122 antagonist, in a Phase 1 trial and ANB101, a BDCA2 modulator, soon to enter clinical development. In addition, Anaptys has developed two cytokine antagonists available for out-licensing: imsidolimab, an anti-IL-36R antagonist, that has completed Phase 3 trials for the treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis, and etokimab, an anti-IL-33 antagonist that is Phase 2/3 ready. Anaptys has also discovered multiple therapeutic antibodies licensed to GSK in a financial collaboration for immuno-oncology, including an anti-PD-1 antagonist (_Jemperli_ (dostarlimab-gxly)) and an anti-TIM-3 antagonist (cobolimab, GSK4069889).

It also has other antibodies in its portfolio, including ANB033, an anti-CD122 antagonist, in a Phase 1 trial and ANB101, a BDCA2 modulator, soon to enter clinical development.
