(Nasdaq: LFWD) (“Lifeward” or the “Company”), a global market leader delivering life-changing solutions to revolutionize what is possible in rehabilitation, recovery, and the pursuit of life’s passions in the face of physical limitation or disability, today applauded the decision by the government of Hungary to establish a new state insurance code to provide coverage for exoskeleton training for individuals living with spinal cord injury.\n\nThis coverage policy follows research conducted by Dr. Péter Cserháti MD, PhD, Director of the Semmelweis University Rehabilitation Clinic in Budapest, Hungary, which examined the long-term therapeutic benefits of rehabilitation with the ReWalk Exoskeleton. \"The active lifestyle achieved by exoskeletons has a proven positive effect on the prevention of potential health complications for those living with spinal cord injury,\" emphasized Dr. Cserháti. He reported that the ReWalk system has been available in Hungary since 2019 at the National Medical Rehabilitation Institute, the legal predecessor of Semmelweis University's Rehabilitation Clinic.\n\n“The leadership of Hungary’s government, medical community and administrators has the potential to improve the lives of many of its citizens living with spinal cord injury. With this decision, access to exoskeletons has now been expanded to include Germany, the United States and Hungary, and these policies are essential drivers for our industry,” said Larry Jasinski, CEO of Lifeward. “Our ongoing strategic path is expansion of coverage by Private Insurers, Medicare Advantage and others in the United States and adding further contracts in Germany. We also encourage health care systems in other countries to follow Hungary’s progressive vision for the paralyzed community.”\n\nZoltán Vadászi, the business line manager of the national distributor Fototronic Kft., emphasized that ReWalk is currently the only exoskeleton that has both US and EU official certification (FDA, CE/MDR) and is also allowed to be used at home to ensure independent walking. There are about 300 new cases of spinal cord injury in Hungary annually.\n\n**About Lifeward** Lifeward designs, develops, and commercializes life-changing solutions that span the continuum of care in physical rehabilitation and recovery, delivering proven functional and health benefits in clinical settings as well as in the home and community.

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNovember 12, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/12486/pdf)\n\n_Second consecutive quarter of 20_ _ReWalk_ _systems_  _sold_\n\n_Robust growth in U.S. ReWalk pipeline of approximately 70 qualified leads for potential claim submission with Medicare and other U.S. payors_\n\nMARLBOROUGH, Mass. and YOKNEAM ILLIT, Israel, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lifeward Ltd., (Nasdaq: LFWD) (“Lifeward” or the “Company”), a global market leader delivering life-changing solutions in physical rehabilitation and recovery, today announced its financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent****Highlights****and Milestones for Lifeward**\n\n  * Lifeward initiated actions to further streamline its U.S. operations including closing two U.S. facilities to complete the integration of AlterG. The actions are expected to save the Company approximately $3 million in operating expenses and improve gross margins by approximately two percentage points when the full impact is achieved.\n  * Lifeward began selling the AlterG family of products through its German sales organization which the Company expects will result in revenue growth from a more focused sales effort and higher margins with little incremental investment by utilizing its existing sales and support infrastructure in Germany.\n  * Lifeward executed a successful launch of the AlterG NEO which was engineered with a new design to allow a lower price point to make the technology more accessible to a broader range of customers. Since the introduction of the NEO at the end of June, Lifeward has generated orders for approximately 40 units as the NEO is quickly becoming a growth driver for the AlterG product line.\n  * Lifeward completed its near-term plans to refresh its Board of Directors with the addition of Robert J. Marshall Jr. as a new director and chairman of the Audit Committee.\n\n\n\n“We continue to build the pipeline of ReWalk cases which we believe will fuel our growth in future quarters,” said Larry Jasinski, Chief Executive Officer. “While the conversion of these cases to revenue can be variable, the underlying growth in leads and qualified cases is growing as we continue to educate the U.S. market on the expanded patient access under the Medicare program and eventually private insurance. At the same time, we also see that the AlterG NEO launch is stimulating incremental customer interest and growth, which we believe will fuel the anticipated recovery in AlterG revenue growth.”\n\n**Third****Quarter****202****4** **Financial Results**\n\nRevenue was $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $4.4 million during the third quarter of 2023, up $1.7 million, or 39%. Revenue from the sale of Lifeward historical products and services including ReWalk exoskeletons, MyoCycles, and ReStore exo-suits was $2.5 million, up $1.0 million, or 173% compared to the prior year. This performance was primarily driven by an increase in ReWalk system sales from the expansion of access through Medicare coverage and stronger sales performance in Germany. Revenue from the sale of AlterG products and services was $3.6 million, a $0.7 million increase from the third quarter of 2023, which had a partial quarter contribution from AlterG following the closing of the acquisition on August 11, 2023.\n\nGross margin was 36.2% during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 19.6% in the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the items listed in the attached non-GAAP reconciliation table, adjusted gross margin was 42.5% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 45.1% in the third quarter of 2023, a 2.6 percentage point decrease. This decline is primarily attributable to lower absorption of factory overhead costs due to lower production volumes of AlterG systems and higher labor costs.\n\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $5.4 million, compared to $8.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the items listed in the attached non-GAAP reconciliation table, adjusted operating expenses were $6.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $6.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, a $0.2 million decrease. This decline is primarily due to reduced R&D expense from the completion of a development program.\n\nOperating loss in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.2 million, compared to $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the items in the attached non-GAAP reconciliation table, adjusted operating loss was $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss was $3.1 million, or $0.35 per share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of $7.5 million, or $0.88 per share, in the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the items in the attached non-GAAP reconciliation table, adjusted net loss was $4.0 million, or $0.45 per share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $4.5 million, or $0.52 per share, during the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, ReWalk had $10.7 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet with no debt. During the third quarter of 2024, cash used in operations was $4.5 million. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, Lifeward had $2.4 million of accounts receivable for Medicare claims, a significant majority of which relates to claims filed before the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\nFactoring in the third quarter performance, Lifeward revises its 2024 full year revenue expectations to the range of $25 million to $26 million in 2024. Based on the current recovery in trends thus far in the fourth quarter, Lifeward expects its sequential growth to resume in the fourth quarter to generate the highest quarterly revenue of the year.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nLifeward management will host its conference call as follows:\n\nDate |  November 12, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime |  8:30 AM EST  \nTelephone |  U.S: |  1-833-316-0561  \nInternational: |  1-412-317-0690  \nIsrael: |  1-80-9212373  \nGermany: |  0800-6647560  \nAccess code |  Please reference the “Lifeward Earnings Call”  \nWebcast (live, listen-only and archive) |  <https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/nof4rjp4>  \n  \nThe archived webcast will be available via the following <https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/nof4rjp4> or through the “Investors” section on our website at [GoLifeward.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=iJHYZ6BpU7M21fQz2n0HudzCsyIU4ovBNowPnKgk6pydwB0_56a8OfRan81WA74uvya1yWqAVVYduDgOvdeuRQ==).\n\n**About Lifeward**\n\nLifeward designs, develops, and commercializes life-changing solutions that span the continuum of care in physical rehabilitation and recovery, delivering proven functional and health benefits in clinical settings as well as in the home and community.

Such forward-looking statements may include projections regarding the Company's future performance and other statements that are not statements of historical fact and, in some cases, may be identified by words like \"anticipate,\" \"assume,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"future,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"seek\" and similar terms or phrases. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management's current expectations, which are subject to uncertainty, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others: the Company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of AlterG, including the possibility that the expected benefits of the acquisition will not be realized within the expected time period or at all; the effect of the AlterG acquisition on the ability of the Company to retain customers and key personnel and to maintain relationships with suppliers, distributors and other key business relations; potential litigation in connection with the AlterG acquisition; uncertainties associated with future clinical trials and the clinical development process, the product development process and FDA regulatory submission review and approval process; the Company's ability to have sufficient funds to meet certain future capital requirements, which could impair the Company's efforts to develop and commercialize existing and new products; the Company's ability to maintain and grow its reputation and the market acceptance of its products; the Company's ability to achieve reimbursement from third-party payors, including CMS, for its products; the Company's limited operating history and its ability to leverage its sales, marketing and training infrastructure; the Company's expectations as to its clinical research program and clinical results; the Company's expectations regarding future growth, including its ability to increase sales in its existing geographic markets and expand to new markets; the Company's ability to obtain certain components of its products from third-party suppliers and its continued access to its product manufacturers; the Company’s ability to navigate any difficulties associated with moving production of its AlterG Anti-Gravity Systems to a contract manufacturer; the Company's ability to improve its products and develop new products; the Company's compliance with medical device reporting regulations to report adverse events involving the Company's products, which could result in voluntary corrective actions or enforcement actions such as mandatory recalls, and the potential impact of such adverse events on the Company's ability to market and sell its products; the Company's ability to gain and maintain regulatory approvals; the Company's ability to maintain adequate protection of its intellectual property and to avoid violation of the intellectual property rights of others; the risk of a cybersecurity attack or breach of the Company's IT systems significantly disrupting its business operations; the Company's ability to use effectively the proceeds of its offerings of securities; and other factors discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC and other documents subsequently filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made in this press release speaks only as of the date hereof. Factors or events that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ from the statements contained herein may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of them. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company believes that the use of non-GAAP accounting measures, including non-GAAP net loss, is helpful to its investors. These measures, which the Company refers to as non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBecause of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash expenses, the Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense and acquisition costs allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period. Each of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures is an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for the Company’s evaluation of its operating results over different periods of time. The non-GAAP financial data are not measures of the Company’s financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to operating loss or net loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in ReWalk’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial results. Further, share-based compensation expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in the Company’s business and an important part of the compensation provided to its employees.\n\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. ReWalk urges investors to review the reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\n\nLifeward Media Relations:Kathleen O’DonnellVice President, Marketing & New Business DevelopmentLifewardE: media@golifeward.comLifeward Investor Contact:Mike LawlessChief Financial OfficerLifewardE: ir@golifeward.com\n\n**Lifeward Ltd.
