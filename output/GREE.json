(Nasdaq: GREE) (“Greenidge” or the “Company”), a vertically integrated cryptocurrency data center and power generation company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its 152-acre Spartanburg, South Carolina property (the “Spartanburg property”) to Data Journey LLC (“Data Journey”) for $12.1 million in cash and an 8% profit participation interest in the property’s planned data center. \n\nGreenidge purchased the Spartanburg property in 2021 for a consideration of $15 million, and it included 175 acres and over 750,000 square feet of industrial buildings. In 2023, Greenidge then sold approximately 23 subdivided acres and its upgraded 44 MW mining facilities to NYDIG ABL LLC (“NYDIG”) for a total consideration of approximately $28 million. The sale of the remaining 152-acre Spartanburg property will now enable Data Journey to build a new data center on the property while leveraging the site’s future access to 60 MW of power that has already been secured by Greenidge. \n\nFollowing the completion of the property sale, Greenidge will provide support to Data Journey in the site development and buildout. The property sale and accompanying profit share structure align with Greenidge’s longstanding focus on identifying and acquiring properties with access to significant low-cost power; evaluating each property’s best use for bitcoin mining and data center development; maximizing power capacity; and, ultimately developing or selling to a strategic buyer, when appropriate. In alignment with this playbook, Greenidge is now evaluating other sites for similar data center buildouts and intends to partner with Data Journey on other similar sites. \n\n“Today marks an exciting step forward for Greenidge as our South Carolina property sale to Data Journey represents our first large-scale entrance into the data center space,” said Greenidge CEO Jordan Kovler. “We continue to see incredible opportunities ahead to leverage our team’s knowledge of electricity markets, infrastructure development and power plants to create value for our investors through a growing portfolio of future actionable properties like Spartanburg.” \n\nKovler added: “As Greenidge continues to evolve, our focus is on scaling our complementary data center expertise alongside our existing bitcoin mining capabilities so that we can further diversify our business and maximize power capacity at each site we own. Data Journey is at the forefront of the data center industry, and we look forward to supporting them as they develop this property and to partnering together on many other projects in the future.” \n\nData Journey currently operates four facilities across two data centers in Catawba County, NC and in Houston, TX. With the acquisition of the Spartanburg property, Data Journey will be able to add another state-of-the-art facility that is equipped with redundant infrastructure and advanced security protocols. The acquisition of the Spartanburg property also further supports Data Journey’s commitment to expand through six new sites in 2025. The acquisition of this property enables a programmatic developmental roll out of multiple buildings in the next few years. The property will start with 60 MW of power from a local electric utility company, and Data Journey will then be supplemented with proprietary onsite power generation scaling up to 100MW in the near term. \n\n“The acquisition of the Spartanburg property from Greenidge is an exciting milestone for Data Journey as it not only marks our entrance into the South Carolina market, but it will also enable us to further expand the data center and IT infrastructure support we can offer to our trusted customers in alignment with our growth goals for the coming year,” said Dr. Ishnella Kaur Azad, CEO & Founder of Data Journey. “Through the work Greenidge has already done to gain a commitment for future power and set the stage for development of the site, we will be able to operationalize the site much quicker than many comparable sites. We look forward to having Greenidge as a partner as we continue to transform the future of data centers.” \n\nThe property sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. \n\n**About Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc.**\n\nGreenidge Generation Holdings Inc.

(NASDAQ: GREE) (“Greenidge” or the “Company”), a vertically integrated cryptocurrency datacenter and power generation company, issued the following information and statement [regarding the ruling](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fiapps.courts.state.ny.us%2Fnyscef%2FViewDocument%3FdocIndex%3DRqJ2byZuIKOo0R7Kaytztw%3D%3D&esheet=54153397&newsitemid=20241114080605&lan=en-US&anchor=regarding+the+ruling&index=1&md5=57ac8a2c6ab552625824031e7c1eac28) today from New York Supreme Court Judge Vincent Dinolfo rejecting the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s (“DEC”) action to deny Greenidge’s application for renewal of a Title V Air Permit. Greenidge’s operations at its New York facility will now continue uninterrupted.\n\nJudge Dinolfo stated in his ruling annulling DEC’s action the following:\n\n  * That DEC “acted in a manner that was both affected by errors of law and arbitrary and capricious”;\n  * The “Final Denial had no rational basis for its decision to forgo CLCPA § 7(2)’s justification analysis”; and\n  * The State’s “interpretation of the analysis required under CLCPA Section 7(2) is flawed”.\n\n\n\n**Statement of Greenidge Generation:**\n\n“Transparent political bias lost today. Facts and the rule of law won. The ruling ensures our facility will continue operating and our local employees will not have their careers ripped away by politically motivated governmental overreach that had no basis in law from the first day it began.\n\n“The Climate Act is a good and well-intended law, but it did not give DEC political appointees and bureaucrats the power to rewrite a statute and unilaterally decide for themselves the value of working-class New Yorkers’ jobs. They tried hard, in concert with their allies in the advocacy community for whom truth was a bridge too far, but no amount of spin could change that fact.\n\n“The damage caused to our company and employees by the recklessness of the DEC and all those who lied about our operation is real, and today the Court set the record straight – we were right, and the state and its allies were wrong.\n\n“This is the seventh court ruling on Greenidge’s operation – with seven decisions in favor of Greenidge. Why? Because when actual judges rule — not DEC political actors — the facts and law govern, and our record is clear: we comply with state and federal law.\n\n“DEC wanted a virtue-signaling result: to shut down a facility with no material impact on reaching Climate Law goals and one that offered significant emissions mitigation consistent with Climate Act aims. So they tried to short-circuit the process to get to their pre-determined outcome – and they got caught.\n\n“This decision highlights the growing importance of data center operations – whether supporting AI, digital currency, cloud computing, or other high-tech businesses – and how we can bring modern career paths to Upstate New Yorkers, who have waited far too long for the opportunity.\n\n“Our facility shows this region can create future-focused data center jobs and economic activity by utilizing power behind the meter – and provide power to the electrical grid everyday – while also meeting the state’s ambitious climate goals.\n\n“Going forward, we hope the DEC will listen to the Court and begin working collaboratively with Greenidge to finalize a new permit, consistent with the court’s rebuke of the State’s decision and for the benefit of New York State.”\n\n**About Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc.**\n\nGreenidge Generation Holdings Inc.

These non-GAAP financial measures are a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to, Greenidge’s results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by Greenidge may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Specifically, Greenidge believes the non-GAAP information provides useful measures to investors regarding Greenidge’s financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that Greenidge believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Greenidge compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. \n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n_Amounts denoted in millions_ |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2024**  \nNet loss from continuing operations  |  $  |  6.3  |  $  |  15.9   \nInterest expense, net  |  1.8  |  5.4   \nIncome tax (gain)  |  (0.1  |  )  |  (0.1  |  )   \nDepreciation  |  3.4  |  9.9   \n**EBITDA loss from continuing operations** |  **(1.2** |  **)** |  **(0.7** |  **)**  \nStock based compensation  |  0.4  |  1.8   \nLoss on sale of assets  |  0.7  |  0.7   \nChange in fair value of warrant asset, after tax  |  —  |  0.4   \nImpairment of long-lived assets  |  —  |  0.2   \n**Adjusted EBITDA (loss) from continuing operations** |  **$** |  **(0.1** |  **)** |  **$** |  **2.4**  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241107235004r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241107235004/en/>\n\n**Investors** Nick Ratti 315-536-2359 nratti@greenidge.com investorrelations@greenidge.com  **Media** Longacre Square Partners Kate Sylvester / Liz Shoemaker, 646-386-0091 greenidge@longacresquare.com\n\nSource: Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc.\n\n[ ](/shareholder-services/email-alerts)\n\n[ ](/shareholder-services/rss-feeds)\n\n[ ](/shareholder-services/contact-ir)\n\nConnect with us on social media.\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/GreenidgeGREE) [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/Greenidge) [](https://twitter.com/Greenidge_GREE)\n"
