(Nasdaq: TCRX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapies for the treatment of patients with cancer, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“As we approach the end of the year, we remain committed to advancing our clinical-stage pipeline across both heme and solid tumor malignancies and providing an update on the ALLOHA Phase 1 trial following ASH. We are encouraged to see that none of the 16 patients on the treatment arm relapsed, including five patients at least one-year post-transplant as of the July 8th abstract cutoff date. We look forward to sharing updated data, including several additional patients, at ASH,” said Gavin MacBeath, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer. “During the third quarter we continued to prioritize screening, enrolling, and dosing patients in the solid tumor program and remain on track to dose our first patient with multiplex therapy and provide an update on our Phase 1 study by the end of the year.” \n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * The Company recently announced an upcoming [oral presentation](https://ir.tscan.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tscan-therapeutics-announces-upcoming-oral-presentation-data) at the 66th ASH Annual Meeting. The data in the abstract included 16 treatment-arm patients and 11 control-arm patients with a data cutoff of July 8, 2024. No dose limiting toxicities were observed across all treatment-arm patients and the safety profile was generally consistent with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). All treatment-arm patients (16 of 16) were relapse-free and minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative as of the data cutoff, whereas three control-arm patients (3 of 11) relapsed, two of whom died from their disease. These data support both the safety and potential of TSC-100 and TSC-101 to reduce relapses and increase relapse-free survival in patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning HCT. Updated data will be presented at the annual meeting.\n\n  * The Company will host a virtual KOL event featuring Ran Reshef, M.D., M.Sc., on Tuesday, December 10th, at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss the data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting. The Company will also discuss its clinical development strategy for the heme program. Dr. Reshef is the Professor of Medicine and Director of the Cellular Immunotherapy Program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Additional details around the call will be provided closer to the event. Registration for the event can be found [here](https://ir.tscan.com/news-events/events-and-presentations).\n\n  * The Company recently increased its internal manufacturing capacity as well as identified a global contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) with commercial capabilities to support both the heme and solid tumor programs. The Company is on track to transfer the commercial heme manufacturing process to the CDMO in 2025.\n\n  * The Company recently presented three posters at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 39th Annual Meeting held in Houston, TX and virtually:\n\n    * Discovery of a MAGE-A4-specific TCR-T Therapy Candidate for Multiplex Treatment of Solid Tumors\n    * Preclinical Models for T-Plex, a Customized Multiplexed TCR-T Cell Therapy Addressing Intra-Tumor Antigen and HLA Heterogeneity\n    * Development of a Target Agnostic Platform to Assess the Reactivity of T Cell Receptor (TCR)-Engineered T Cell (TCR-T) Therapies to Primary Human Tissues\n\n\n\nCopies of the presentation materials can be found under the “[ _Publications_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OFAbPNWKLWvPx6pDSVzQWDu-X8_q-rLwkMJ--JxRBYuYokbPDzOEBT82hI6Na61ozHcZN1ErO0vW1IyG0lwTISO2vjUMu7MgJZSkMhSY53mg6SZ0AX1CsNg3dYKI0FIOvR1x1QeRLC4rZ-lYtjyh17JEPVIOPbwRwo53GTMcVI9AQwBwjhMEbIoQ3mZsec3rWHjIdxHxJcsMxSbOoryAbJqvVh_v_6brWaiN4j8-u6zaJGt7FgQNNrMmL1xq-nZXw9pJSgU4dCGK9tnIF0tMrA==)” section of the Company’s website at [ _tscan.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QmR6Re1gadLYwN_sq8aASIPsD_BZPQw4RTl5eDWY0IAjp5FdBWIt-epS5OAAETlmUE4LwIk-c1FP8wc23_TMkJSXQq9LamqxgfDJ1dcVpDd1WEue3Ryyp4EUDQIYuL_BVGwMChpkkUZ2Mxp9IMNQkaREa7gDA1a0N-z4cadCIXrrCQBM-OQ9yhUE0mYmtqXCgTrGwCFrgUEb-CXGMjCV_3OFPqYOjQSdsNxm4tI7pno=) _._\n\n**Upcoming Anticipated Milestones**\n\n _Heme Malignancies Program: TScan’s two lead TCR-T therapy candidates, TSC-100 and TSC-101, are designed to treat residual disease and prevent relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allogeneic HCT (the ALLOHA TM trial, _[ _NCT05473910_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=k-SC-chwO6EXdtbXygUu_ubnrQkp-uOScKJOEm5-MNKIk6ww-oJO1EU1tX8CQtOpmcjewpv8qIT3xSXKNpGwRtgSf5L3teeBUYjlE8YH438s1yj0iKdFpw6af64z-pk4NpfG2bfah2AFv7LyPRRMJYojP8uWN17WfvtoBv2ZqR_WpQg8hatHWoxwZxXg8cPWuihKLZld54mQtKNJUSNBb-MG71oxc9vuz4uGwImSX_UrkOR2XQ5Nt6f0SxFtzB_oEP-TA96n7424C6eBRYo51oxSu-yiyqqAS-Lzadc0jhRa_kzaJ80_J5nET431G3qjS8DKEfHQoRYOymQzC37zTPSD8oyK1oU6n911uEgTPCtjSGHHq06Jsqq_MU8DHuC17OLaFRrXFOBmp9zoisAF2bqFCS2E_Yy8sR8D-c-vOvvSVLivKwibBQe4GqXDR6xQgh9k3hXZLbjwl-tDBOZzsXARtXYTbhO1RX9QpntjLBZ-wV9feECBPh9wNLHZI9mjwMJrDLyA7EAoBxMx48EEXg==) _)._\n\n  * Plans to open expansion cohorts at the proposed recommended Phase 2 dose level to further characterize safety and evaluate translational and efficacy endpoints by the end of 2024.\n  * One-year clinical and translational data on initial patients to be reported by the end of 2024.\n  * Initiate a registration trial, pending feedback from regulatory authorities, and plans to report two-year clinical and translational data in 2025. \n\n\n\n _Solid Tumor Program: TScan continues to expand the ImmunoBank, a collection of therapeutic TCR-Ts that target different cancer-associated antigens presented on diverse HLA types.

The decrease was primarily due to timing of research activities pursuant to the Company’s collaboration agreement with Amgen which commenced in May 2023.\n\n**R &D Expenses: **Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $26.3 million, compared to $22.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase of $3.5 million was primarily driven by an increase in clinical studies expense associated with the ongoing enrollment of our ALLOHA Phase 1 heme trial and start-up activities and initial enrollment in our Phase 1 solid tumor clinical trial, as well as an increase in personnel expenses due to additional headcount in support of our expanded research and development activities. Research and development expenses included non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.2 million and $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**G &A Expenses: **General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $7.4 million, compared to $5.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase of $1.5 million was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expenses due to increased headcount to support business activities. General and administrative expenses included non-cash stock compensation expense of $1.3 million and $0.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss was $29.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $23.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, and included net interest income of $2.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, were $271.1 million, excluding $5.0 million of restricted cash. The Company believes that its existing cash resources will continue to fund its current operating plan into the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\n**Share Count:** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had issued and outstanding shares of 53,354,124, which consists of 49,077,536 shares of voting common stock and 4,276,588 shares of non-voting common stock, and outstanding pre-funded warrants to purchase 65,587,945 shares of voting common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share.\n\n**About TScan Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nTScan is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapies for the treatment of patients with cancer.

(Nasdaq: TCRX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapies for the treatment of patients with cancer, today announced that preliminary results from the ALLOHA™ Phase 1 trial of TSC-100 and TSC-101, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with reduced intensity conditioning, will be featured in an oral presentation at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition being held December 7 – 10 in San Diego, CA. A copy of the abstract is now available online via the ASH website at [www.hematology.org](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wxubiQ8BkIQp_mRIEpRTPVcAKsLnPOQdClVoqKNSJWNZf2mYKQw4JfUmmtTHUfPmf46ad_tccYdLnQT5Pw3aBvOAP09Xm1cVSJNoBaPeuoo=).\n\n“Disease relapse is the leading cause of death in patients undergoing transplant with reduced intensity conditioning,” said Gavin MacBeath, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer. “TSC-100 and TSC-101 were designed with this significant unmet need in mind, and preliminary clinical and translational data from the ALLOHA trial supports the safety and potential of TSC-100 and TSC-101 to reduce relapses and increase relapse-free survival. We look forward to providing additional data from the ongoing trial at the meeting in December.”\n\nIn the ongoing ALLOHA Phase 1 trial (NCT05473910), patients receive either TSC-100 or TSC-101 post-HCT, whereas control-arm patients receive HCT alone as per standard of care. As of the July 8, 2024 data cut, 27 patients were enrolled in the trial and had undergone HCT, with 16 in the treatment arm and 11 in the control arm. No relapses occurred in the treatment arm versus three relapses in the control arm. Median time to relapse was not evaluable in TSC-treated patients, where no relapses occurred, versus 159 days in the control arm. All five TSC-treated patients that reached one-year follow-up remained relapse-free and MRD negative as of the data cutoff, consistent with effective elimination of residual cancer cells post-HCT. No dose limiting toxicities occurred following TSC-100 or TSC-101 infusions and safety was similar in the treatment and control arms, with expected post-HCT adverse events.\n\nEnrollment in the ALLOHA Phase 1 trial continues and updated data will be presented at the meeting in December.\n\n**Oral Presentation Details:**\n\n**Title:**[TSC-100 and TSC-101 Demonstrate the Potential to Reduce Relapse Rates and Increase Relapse-Free Survival in Patients with AML, ALL, or MDS Undergoing Allogeneic HCT with Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC): Preliminary Results from the Phase 1 ALLOHA Trial](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=u9owYHCouQDJxQx-R6Kird6F91k1YY7-zKoNSlNv609bUfS6uRVhw2qrgs5rbSufwOnWKpY3cvEPNpmWeqG3ocQYcqzMNM1o8pIi0C5RPjs7w7G3H2ttN4Ci_xGGmkSFySEF24VrPAffbEwwcSOjm7kfVkWbH4NicRD6IKQbiAJLNqzEvE2SMf9_my2lkd2J6rM7ngvIxyG-W1AZX58rWZ-L6HdTD9oZpDYDtvPqg-VJLvifKuFTUdbpkOcQTE31NWjvYehw0m3X6pbsS6ubQnnOBCmJdRp4wWJks9Q1dM8A7dVdh40mIMAcKyxi-se_qHcsbCgrGTmc243vdTZcllCPLYWvkFR7YNtxwEZY-H1B49LzdUw_9Qw74jjSZmUIehAm0wYJ37Gnbcgd1Qg1lbmT3GcZYYVpMKCfxTVdxpDOCXgvi3EXvTc5AC5HghoDd5yYoNerg-66VuWoez929Q==)**Authors:** Monzr M Al Malki, Alla Keyzner, Uday Popat, Yi-Bin Chen, Hyung C Suh, Tania Jain, Melhem M Solh, Anson Snow, Saar Gill, Lohith Gowda, Joseph Uberti, Erica Buonomo, Yun Wang, Nancy Nabilsi, Timothy White, Cuong Nguyen, Jim Murray, Gavin MacBeath, Chrystal Louis, Shrikanta Chattopadhyay, Michelle Matzko, Ran Reshef**Publication Number:** 924**Session Name:** 704.
