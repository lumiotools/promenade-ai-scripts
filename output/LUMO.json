Ventures’ Acquisition of Lumos Pharma\n\n[PDF Version](/node/15676/pdf)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas and GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Lumos Pharma, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Vqzsqdym42b3xTR5_HovSEtHrr_aV-ypmaAbT6KexF62AN1wp4nWvvhfhpqpeS86Orptu9XYW8yrxskMXjpVHcO4WT3W8WJl3672CNqwuQk=) (NASDAQ:LUMO) (“Lumos Pharma” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics for rare diseases, and Double Point Ventures LLC (“DPV”) today announced the successful completion of the previously announced tender offer for Lumos Pharma’s shares at a purchase price of (i) $4.25 per share in cash at closing, without interest and less applicable tax withholding and (ii) one contingent value right (“CVR”) for each share of common stock outstanding, representing the future right to receive additional contingent cash payments upon the achievement of certain milestone events relating to the level of annual global net revenue of LUM-201 up to the year 2037, different transactions involving Lumos Pharma or its assets that occur within 18 months of closing or certain sales, license or similar revenue-generating agreements entered into within 18 months of closing and that are related to Lumos Pharma’s legacy products other than LUM-201. There can be no assurance any payments will be made with respect to the CVRs. The purchase price of $4.25 per share represents a total equity value of approximately $38 million, a premium of 7.6% to Lumos Pharma’s closing share price of $3.95 on October 22, 2024, and a premium of 10.5% to Lumos Pharma’s 30-trading-day volume weighted average price as of October 22, 2024.\n\nThe tender offer expired one minute after 11:59pm Eastern Time on December 11, 2024. As of the expiration of the tender offer, 6,544,417 shares of Lumos Pharma common stock were validly tendered into and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer, representing approximately 75.62% of Lumos Pharma’s outstanding shares. All conditions of the tender offer were satisfied or waived and all shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn were accepted for payment and DPV or its affiliates is promptly paying for all such tendered shares in accordance with the terms of the tender offer.\n\nAs a result of its acceptance of the shares tendered in the tender offer, DPV and its affiliates acquired a sufficient number of shares of Lumos Pharma’s common stock to close the merger without the affirmative vote of Lumos Pharma’s other stockholders, pursuant to Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. As such, the merger was completed today, December 12, 2024.\n\nWith the successful completion of the merger, Lumos Pharma will operate as a standalone business of DPV from its current headquarters in Austin, Texas. Each outstanding share of Lumos Pharma’s common stock that was not validly tendered in the tender offer (other than shares owned by affiliates of DPV, Lumos Pharma (as treasury stock) or by any stockholder of Lumos Pharma who is entitled to and properly demanded and perfected appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the applicable provisions of Delaware law) was cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to $4.25 per share, without interest and less applicable tax withholding and (ii) one CVR. In addition, the common stock of Lumos Pharma ceased to trade on NASDAQ and a notice of delisting with respect to shares of Lumos Pharma is expected to be filed promptly by NASDAQ.\n\n**Advisors**\n\nPiper Sandler LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Lumos Pharma, and Cooley LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. acted as legal counsel.

or ESPE 2024, held November 16-18, 2024 in Liverpool, UK.\n\n“The new analyses and updated data from our Phase 2 OraGrowtH210 and OraGrowtH212 Trials presented at ESPE this week demonstrate sustained growth on LUM-201 in moderate Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (PGHD) to 24 months, as well as the correlation of LUM-201’s pulsatile mechanism of action (MOA) to growth,” said John C. McKew, PhD, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Lumos Pharma. “We are encouraged by these data and look forward to advancing oral LUM-201 in a Phase 3 clinical trial in moderate PGHD next year.”\n\nIn the oral presentation of Abstract FC7.6 on Sunday, November 17th, entitled,_Growth, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 Responses to Oral LUM-201 in OraGrowtH210 and OraGrowtH212 Trials in Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (PGHD) Over 12 to 24 Months on Treatment_(Elżbieta Petriczko, MD, PhD, _et al_) [[link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9jTKQDS86eZn5su9dfehWzwagfL0-kh5ZHbGbYv-i7FhjzCMMgbcXAGlraGIpDd4zPaIzzSyJ1N2VEzjJ1ByXsoQmGGqoyPk5k5q_oSZ79rnfYSt7W5_GtJt9TzXq-sXrrHV2cGbProfKg4FJUwJGQ==)], the investigator reviewed updated combined data from the Phase 2 OraGrowtH210 and OraGrowtH212 Trials out to 24 months following treatment with LUM-201.\n\n  * Results showed that at six months on LUM-201, a significant increase over baseline in Annualized Height Velocity (AHV) was observed for the combined 1.6 and 3.2 mg/kg/day doses. At baseline, AHV was 4.6 cm/yr for 37 subjects for which baseline data were available vs 7.8 cm/yr at 6 months on LUM-201 for 66 subjects.\n  * Results also showed that growth rates on oral LUM-201 (combined 1.6 and 3.2 mg/kg dose cohorts) were sustained out to 24 months with AHVs of 7.3 (N=65), 7.5 (N=36), and 7.3 (N=20) cm/yr at 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively [graphic below].\n\n\n\n![ESPE PR - Graphic 1](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/f1abdd2c-307b-47bb-8cc9-3c555fe00c85/espe-pr-graphic-1.jpg)\n\n  * Combined results also demonstrated significant increases in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels from baseline out to 24 months, with IGF-1 increasing from 13.1 (baseline) to 25.5 (12 months) to 29.2 (24 months) nmol/L and IGFBP-3 increasing from 133.5 (baseline) to 179.6 (12 months) to 186.2 (24 months) nmol/L.\n  * **Conclusions** : LUM-201 shows a significant increase in AHV at 6 months, and the effect continues with a minimal decrease in AHV through 24 months. Compared to historical rhGH (KIGS)1, LUM-201 has a smaller drop in AHV from 12 months to 24 months. LUM-201 significantly increases IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels at 12 months which continues to 24 months. A favorable investigational safety profile has been observed to date.\n\n\n\nIn the late-breaking oral presentation of Abstract FC15.2 on Monday, November 18th, entitled,_Amount and Pattern of Pulsatile GH Secretion Induced by the Oral Growth Hormone Secretagogue LUM-201 Is Related to Growth and IGF-1 Responses in Moderate Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (PGHD)_(Peter E.
