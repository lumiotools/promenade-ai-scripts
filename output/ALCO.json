(“Alico”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) (Nasdaq: ALCO) today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the highlights of which are as follows:\n\n  * **The Company previously announced that it entered a new three-year agreement to sell oranges to Tropicana at prices that are approximately 33% to 50% higher, over the life of the contract, than the average price for all the citrus fruit sold to Tropicana last season.**\n  * **The Company****has now treated substantially all of its producing trees with Oxytetracycline (“OTC”) and anticipates that these 4.5 million trees will support meaningful production growth in the 2024-25 harvest season.**\n  * **The Company previously announced that it has continued to commit to its real estate activities by hiring Mitch Hutchcraft, who joined Alico as Executive Vice President of Real Estate in May 2024.**\n  * **The Company's Board of Directors is announcing, as part of its succession plan, the anticipated appointment of a current Director, Adam Putnam, as the next Chairman of the Board when the current Chairman, George Brokaw, completes his term as Chairman in February 2025.

The decrease in our net income attributable to Alico common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was driven by Hurricane Ian insurance proceeds of $17.5 million received during the three months ended June 30, 2023 (the “Insurance Proceeds”), which were recorded as a reduction of operating expenses, partially offset by a gain of $4.4 million from the sale of citrus land in the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in our net income attributable to Alico common stockholders for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was driven by a gain of $74.9 million on the sale of the remaining 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch on December 21, 2023 and a gain of $4.4 million from the sale of citrus land on June 28, 2024, partially offset by inventory adjustments recorded at September 30, 2022 on the ending inventory balance, as a result of the impact of Hurricane Ian, which effectively lowered the inventory to be expensed in fiscal year 2023, $21.4 million of Insurance Proceeds, and a $9.4 million increase in the tax provision for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had a (loss) earnings of $(0.27) and $3.29 per diluted common share, respectively, compared to earnings of $1.56 and $0.12 per diluted common share for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had EBITDA of $1.3 million and $48.7 million, respectively, compared to $18.8 million and $16.5 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $(3.4) million and $(4.4) million, respectively, and $(1.3) million and $(12.5) million, respectively.\n\nThese quarterly financial results also reflect the seasonal nature of the Company’s business. The majority of the Company’s citrus crop is typically harvested in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year; consequently, most of the Company’s gross profit and cash flows from operating activities are recognized in those quarters. However, due to the timing of the current year harvest, more of the citrus crop was harvested in the first and second quarters of this fiscal year. Furthermore, the Company’s working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year.\n\n**Alico Citrus Division Results**\n\nCitrus production for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is summarized in the following table.\n\n_(in thousands, except per box and per pound solids data)_  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****June 30,** | **Change** |  **Nine Months Ended****June 30,** | **Change**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **Unit** | **%** | **2024** | **2023** | **Unit** | **%**  \n**Boxes Harvested:**  \nEarly and Mid-Season | — | — | — | — | 1,194 | 979 | 215 | 22.0 | %  \nValencias | 843 | 415 | 428 | 103.1 | % | 1,855 | 1,669 | 186 | 11.1 | %  \nTotal Processed | 843 | 415 | 428 | 103.1 | % | 3,049 | 2,648 | 401 | 15.1 | %  \nFresh Fruit | — | 1 | (1 | ) | (100.0 | )% | 35 | 41 | (6 | ) | (14.6 | )%  \nTotal | 843 | 416 | 427 | 102.6 | % | 3,084 | 2,689 | 395 | 14.7 | %  \n**Pound Solids Produced:**  \nEarly and Mid-Season | — | — | — | — | 5,364 | 4,586 | 778 | 17.0 | %  \nValencias | 4,294 | 2,142 | 2,152 | 100.5 | % | 9,365 | 8,702 | 663 | 7.6 | %  \nTotal | 4,294 | 2,142 | 2,152 | 100.5 | % | 14,729 | 13,288 | 1,441 | 10.8 | %  \n**Pound Solids per Box:**  \nEarly and Mid-Season | — | — | — | — | 4.49 | 4.68 | (0.19 | ) | (4.0 | )%  \nValencias | 5.09 | 5.16 | (0.07 | ) | (1.3 | )% | 5.05 | 5.21 | (0.16 | ) | (3.1 | )%  \n**Price per Pound Solids:**  \nEarly and Mid-Season | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | — | $ | 2.71 | $ | 2.61 | $ | 0.10 | 3.8 | %  \nValencias | $ | 2.84 | $ | 2.83 | $ | 0.01 | 0.3 | % | $ | 2.87 | $ | 2.76 | $ | 0.11 | 4.1 | %  \n  \nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, Alico Citrus harvested approximately 0.8 million and 3.1 million boxes of fruit, respectively, compared to 0.4 million and 2.7 million boxes of fruit in the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase in boxes harvested was driven by the timing of the harvest for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and as a result of our production beginning to recover to pre-hurricane levels during the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Early and Mid-Season and Valencia harvests are complete and for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 pound solids produced were up 17.0% and 7.6%, respectively, while pound solids per box were down 4.0% and 3.1%, respectively. Additionally, we realized an increase in the price per pound solids of 3.8% and 4.1%, respectively, in the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana.\n\nOur average realized/blended price per pound solids for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased 3.9%, as compared to the same period of the prior year. As a result of our signing of the new contract with Tropicana, the Company expects that our prices per pound solid will increase more significantly next year.\n\nWe expect it may take another season, or more, for the groves to fully recover to pre-Hurricane Ian production levels.\n\n**Land Management and Other Operations Division Results**\n\nLand Management and Other Operations includes lease income from grazing rights leases, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction rights to third parties, and other miscellaneous income.\n\nLand Management and Other Operations revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 decreased 34.8% and 10.6%, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year principally due to a decrease in hunting lease revenue as a result of the sale of the ranch land.\n\nThe 19.2% decrease in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in property taxes related to land sales. The 15.3% increase in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in mining permitting costs.\n\n**Management Comment**\n\nJohn Kiernan, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\nI wanted to thank our investors who checked in over the weekend as Hurricane Debby approached the Florida coastline. Alico, and my fellow employees, had a wet weekend, and we expect rain to continue each day for the rest of the week, but we did not sustain any damage from Debby. Our thoughts are with all of our fellow Floridians who were impacted by this storm yesterday. Alico had been through dozens of storms over the past century, and we take every one seriously. Thank you again for your concern.\n\nDuring the past quarter, Alico finished harvesting the last fruit in our 2023-24 season. Fruit quality was poor at the beginning of both our Early-Mid and Valencia crop harvests but improved; however, the rate of fruit drop accelerated during both harvests. Lower levels of production for the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia harvests this season resulted in lower levels of pounds solid being sold, which has led to a total inventory write-down of $28.5 million in fiscal year 2024. We believe that the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia box production was affected by the continued impacts of Hurricane Ian. We managed our costs aggressively over the past year, but the lower revenue base was out of our control for the second year in a row.\n\nWe have several reasons to be more optimistic about our production next season. First, since 2017 Alico has planted 2.2 million trees, and nearly all of them are now producing fruit. Second, Alico began treating its citrus trees in January 2023 with an OTC product via trunk injection as a citrus greening therapy. In 2023, we were able to treat over 35% of our producing trees with OTC and in 2024, we treated approximately 4.5 million producing trees. Alico received $1.8 million of grant money from the Florida Citrus Research and Field Trial Foundation in January 2024 that covered substantially all of the costs of the 2023-24 harvest season OTC applications, and $1.1 million was received in June that will cover approximately 34% of the 2024-25 harvest season OTC applications. Although the small crop harvested this past season was not impressive, we believe that the continued recovery from Hurricane Ian was the most significant factor impacting fruit production and quality. We remain cautiously optimistic that being another year removed from the hurricane, along with the combination of a second round of injections for previously treated trees and a first round of injections for trees that were not treated in 2023, will show more significant improvements, not just in yield, but also in reduced fruit drop. In fact, in July it was reported that the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services approved a label change for the OTC product to remove the restriction that the product cannot be applied more than two years in a row. This change will enable us to apply the OTC treatment in calendar year 2025 to the trees that we started treating in 2023, which would be a relief to Alico and the Florida citrus industry overall. Third, as Alico’s production recovers next season, we will sell our fruit at higher prices. As we previously announced, the Company and Tropicana have extended our relationship for another 3 years. With our new contract to supply Tropicana with fruit, Alico will realize significantly higher prices per pound solid, which better reflect current market pricing, with price increases in the second and third years. This new contract covers production on approximately 65% of our acres. The remainder of our acres are covered by a contract with Tropicana, which expires at the end of the 2024-25 season but which also has higher pricing than the expiring contracts.\n\nAs the Atlantic hurricane season becomes more active over the next few months, Alico is prepared and focused on managing its world-class citrus operations, just as it has for more than 125 years. One of our greatest competitive advantages, as we face potential weather uncertainties, is our balance sheet liquidity. Our relationships with our lenders remain strong and we have approximately $94.8 million of undrawn capacity under a combination of a revolving line of credit, which matures in November 2029, and a working capital line of credit, which matures in November 2025, to provide ample liquidity as our trees continue to recover from Hurricane Ian. Our $70 million of term debt does not amortize, and is not due for repayment until 2029. We have steady access to workers and contractors, and our employee base is stable.\n\nOutside of our citrus operations, Alico continues to invest resources as it evaluates the long-term highest and best use of our real estate assets. To be clear, Alico will continue to conduct our regular citrus operations at nearly all of our groves for years to come. We will continue evaluating all of our properties to explore creative solutions to enhance and extract value. We seek to provide our investors with the benefits and stability of a conventional agriculture investment, with the optionality that comes with active land management. Last year, after evaluating the direct hit it took from Hurricane Ian in 2022, we made a difficult decision to transition our TRB grove in Charlotte County from proprietary citrus operations to a mix of third-party mining, vegetable and fruit crop leasing activities. This year, we evaluated another grove and have decided to also move beyond citrus there to realize its highest and best use. In 2022, Alico entered into a Purchase Option Agreement (“Option Agreement”) with a third party, E.R. Jahna Industries, Inc. (“Jahna”) for the sale of approximately 899 acres of land at a price of approximately $11,500 per acre on our 2x6 grove located in Hendry County, Florida, which expires in January 2025. It is expected that this Option Agreement will be exercised by the end of December 2024. It is understood that Jahna plans to conduct sand mining operations on the land once regulatory approval has been obtained, and Alico will have the right to lease back most of these acres, including 340 net citrus acres, for de minimis lease payments. In April 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell another approximately 798 acres of land at the 2x6 grove to a third party for approximately $7.2 million ($9,000 per acre), that includes an option to purchase another 680 acres within ten months from the closing date of the sale, at the same price per acre and Alico will continue to grow citrus on those 680 acres for the next harvest season. This previously announced transaction, which closed at the end of June 2024, illustrates our strategy of monetizing citrus groves on a case by case basis to redeploy capital to generate better returns for our shareholders.\n\nIn addition to our citrus operations, Alico has been pursuing a diversified real estate strategy since early 2022, which began with a comprehensive analysis of our land holdings portfolio. That process encouraged us to begin the entitlement process for our 4,500 acre grove in Collier County. In May, we recruited Mitch Hutchcraft to lead our Real Estate activities to accelerate the entitlement activities at Corkscrew, as well as develop a comprehensive analysis of highest and best use for remaining properties and create a roadmap to execute these strategic initiatives. Alico is continuing to evaluate every acre for its highest and best use, against its near-term potential for continued cash flow generation from our existing agricultural operations.\n\nI am also pleased to announce that, as part of our succession planning process, current board member Adam Putnam has been selected to be appointed Chairman of the Board of Alico following our next Annual General Meeting to be held in 2025. Adam will succeed George Brokaw, who has served as Chairman since February 2022 and as a Director since November 2013. George will continue to serve Alico as a Director of the Company.\n\nAdam has served on the Alico Board of Directors since August 2020 and has extensive knowledge and experience in the areas of agriculture, sustainability, government affairs, supply chain, business leadership and finance. Adam has served as the Chief Executive Officer of Ducks Unlimited, a U.S. nonprofit organization dedicated to the conservation of wetlands and associated upland habitats for waterfowl, other wildlife, and people since April 2019. Prior to joining Ducks Unlimited, he served as Florida’s Commissioner of Agriculture from 2011 until 2019, where he focused on fostering the growth of Florida agriculture and protecting the state’s water supply, among other issues, and was a U.S. Congressman for five terms, from 2001 until 2011, where he engaged on issues such as agriculture, water and energy. He also was the House Republican Conference Chair from 2007 until 2009.

The decrease was primarily due to lower employee costs (as a result of lower bonus accruals), lower depreciation, lower legal costs (as a result of the voluntary dismissal of the shareholder lawsuit in the prior year), and lower accounting and insurance costs.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $0.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to lower depreciation, legal and insurance costs, partially offset by increased employee costs.\n\nOther Expense, net for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $2.5 million, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by gains of $4.4 million on the sale of 798 acres of citrus land during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to gains of $2.6 million on the sale of 548 acres of the Alico Ranch during the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nOther Expense, net for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased $75.2 million, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch to the State of Florida and the sale of 798 acres of citrus land during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. By comparison, for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 we recognized gains on sale of property and equipment of approximately $7.4 million relating to the sale of 1,436 acres, in the aggregate, from the Alico Ranch to several third parties.\n\n**Dividend**\n\nOn July 12, 2024, the Company paid a third quarter cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its outstanding common stock to stockholders of record as of June 28, 2024.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nThe Company continues to demonstrate financial strength within its balance sheet, as highlighted below:\n\n  * The Company’s working capital was $34.0 million at June 30, 2024, representing a 2.67 to 1:00 ratio.\n  * The Company maintains a solid debt to total assets ratio.

measurements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), Alico utilizes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Net Debt, which are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, to evaluate the performance of its business. Due to significant depreciable assets associated with the nature of our operations and, to a lesser extent, interest costs associated with our capital structure, management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Net Debt are important measures to evaluate our results of operations between periods on a more comparable basis and to help investors analyze underlying trends in our business, evaluate the performance of our business both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and the broader market, provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and operational strength of our business and help investors evaluate our ability to service our debt. Such measurements are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP information provided is unique to Alico and may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and adjustments for non-recurring transactions or transactions that are not indicative of our core operating results, such as gains or losses on sales of real estate, property and equipment and assets held for sale. Net Debt is defined as Current portion of long-term debt, Long-term debt, net and Lines of credit, less cash. The Company is not able to provide a quantitative reconciliation of its full-year 2024 guidance as to Net Debt to Current portion of long-term debt, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and has not provided forward-looking guidance for Current portion of long-term debt because of the uncertainty around certain items that may impact Current portion of long-term debt that are not within our control or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort.\n\n**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**\n\n_(in thousands)_ | **(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended****June 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended****June 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Alico, Inc. common stockholders | $ | (2,044 | ) | $ | 11,832 | $ | 25,097 | $ | 895  \nInterest expense, net | 533 | 1,196 | 2,551 | 3,618  \nIncome tax (benefit) provision | (861 | ) | 1,923 | 9,721 | 306  \nDepreciation, depletion and amortization | 3,715 | 3,838 | 11,317 | 11,685  \nEBITDA | 1,343 | 18,789 | 48,686 | 16,504  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nInventory net realizable value adjustment | — | — | 28,549 | 1,616  \nEmployee stock compensation expense (1) | 57 | 61 | 169 | 281  \nFederal relief - Hurricane Irma | — | (49 | ) | — | (1,315 | )  \nInsurance proceeds - Hurricane Ian | (299 | ) | (17,482 | ) | (299 | ) | (22,241 | )  \nGain on sale of property and equipment | (4,491 | ) | (2,605 | ) | (81,520 | ) | (7,368 | )  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | (3,390 | ) | $ | (1,286 | ) | $ | (4,415 | ) | $ | (12,523 | )  \n(1) Includes stock compensation expense for current executives, senior management and other employees.  \n  \n**Net Debt**\n\n_(in thousands)_ | **(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \n---|---|---  \n**June 30,****2024** |  **September 30,****2023**  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt | $ | 1,410 | $ | 2,566  \nLong-term debt, net | 82,642 | 101,410  \nLines of credit | — | 24,722  \nTotal Debt | 84,052 | 128,698  \nLess: Cash | (9,106 | ) | (1,062 | )  \nNet Debt | $ | 74,946 | $ | 127,636  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/2f3720bf-b16e-43b5-9deb-db09cf1e33f0/small/alico-inc-logo.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2f3720bf-b16e-43b5-9deb-db09cf1e33f0)\n\nSource: Alico, Inc. \n\nReleased August 5, 2024\n"

The increase in\nour net income attributable to Alico common stockholders for the nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was driven by a gain of\n$74.9 million on the sale of the remaining 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch on December 21,\n2023 and a gain of $4.4 million from the sale of citrus land on June 28, 2024, partially offset\nby inventory adjustments recorded at September 30, 2022 on the ending inventory balance,\nas a result of the impact of Hurricane Ian, which effectively lowered the inventory to be\nexpensed in fiscal year 2023, $21.4 million of Insurance Proceeds, and a $9.4 million\nincrease in the tax provision for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. For the three and\nnine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had a (loss) earnings of $(0.27) and $3.29\nper diluted common share, respectively, compared to earnings of $1.56 and $0.12 per\ndiluted common share for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had EBITDA of $1.3\nmillion and $48.7 million, respectively, compared to $18.8 million and $16.5 million for the\nthree and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the\nthree and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $(3.4) million and\n$(4.4) million, respectively, and $(1.3) million and $(12.5) million, respectively.\nThese quarterly financial results also reflect the seasonal nature of the Company’s business.\nThe majority of the Company’s citrus crop is typically harvested in the second and third\nquarters of the fiscal year; consequently, most of the Company’s gross profit and cash flows\nfrom operating activities are recognized in those quarters. However, due to the timing of the\ncurrent year harvest, more of the citrus crop was harvested in the first and second quarters\nof this fiscal year. Furthermore, the Company’s working capital requirements are typically\ngreater in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year.\nAlico Citrus Division Results\nCitrus production for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is\nsummarized in the following table.\n(in thousands, except per box and per pound solids data)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, Change June 30, Change\n2024 2023 Unit % 2024 2023 Unit %\nBoxes Harvested:\nEarly and Mid-Season — — — — 1,194 979 215 22.0%\nValencias 843 415 428 103.1% 1,855 1,669 186 11.1%\nTotal Processed 843 415 428 103.1% 3,049 2,648 401 15.1%\nFresh Fruit — 1 (1) (100.0)% 35 41 (6) (14.6)%\nTotal 843 416 427 102.6% 3,084 2,689 395 14.7%\nPound Solids Produced:\nEarly and Mid-Season — — — — 5,364 4,586 778 17.0%\nValencias 4,294 2,142 2,152 100.5% 9,365 8,702 663 7.6%\nTotal 4,294 2,142 2,152 100.5% 14,729 13,288 1,441 10.8%\nPound Solids per Box:\nEarly and Mid-Season — — — — 4.49 4.68 (0.19) (4.0)%\nValencias 5.09 5.16 (0.07) (1.3)% 5.05 5.21 (0.16) (3.1)%\nPrice per Pound Solids:\nEarly and Mid-Season $ — $ — $ — — $ 2.71 $ 2.61 $ 0.10 3.8%\nValencias $ 2.84 $ 2.83 $ 0.01 0.3% $ 2.87 $ 2.76 $ 0.11 4.1%\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, Alico Citrus harvested approximately\n0.8 million and 3.1 million boxes of fruit, respectively, compared to 0.4 million and 2.7 million\nboxes of fruit in the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase in boxes harvested\nwas driven by the timing of the harvest for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and as a\nresult of our production beginning to recover to pre-hurricane levels during the nine months\nended June 30, 2024.\nThe Early and Mid-Season and Valencia harvests are complete and for the nine months\nended June 30, 2024 pound solids produced were up 17.0% and 7.6%, respectively, while\npound solids per box were down 4.0% and 3.1%, respectively. Additionally, we realized an\nincrease in the price per pound solids of 3.8% and 4.1%, respectively, in the nine months\nended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of more\nfavorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana.\nOur average realized/blended price per pound solids for the nine months ended June 30,\n2024 increased 3.9%, as compared to the same period of the prior year. As a result of our\nsigning of the new contract with Tropicana, the Company expects that our prices per pound\nsolid will increase more significantly next year.\nWe expect it may take another season, or more, for the groves to fully recover to pre-\nHurricane Ian production levels.\nLand Management and Other Operations Division Results\nLand Management and Other Operations includes lease income from grazing rights leases,\nhunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil\nextraction rights to third parties, and other miscellaneous income.\nLand Management and Other Operations revenue for the three and nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024 decreased 34.8% and 10.6%, respectively, as compared to the same period\nin the prior year principally due to a decrease in hunting lease revenue as a result of the sale\nof the ranch land.\nThe 19.2% decrease in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in property taxes related to land sales. The\n15.3% increase in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the\nnine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023,\nwas primarily due to an increase in mining permitting costs.\nManagement Comment\nJohn Kiernan, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\nI wanted to thank our investors who checked in over the weekend as Hurricane Debby\napproached the Florida coastline. Alico, and my fellow employees, had a wet weekend, and\nwe expect rain to continue each day for the rest of the week, but we did not sustain any\ndamage from Debby. Our thoughts are with all of our fellow Floridians who were impacted by\nthis storm yesterday. Alico had been through dozens of storms over the past century, and\nwe take every one seriously. Thank you again for your concern.\nDuring the past quarter, Alico finished harvesting the last fruit in our 2023-24 season. Fruit\nquality was poor at the beginning of both our Early-Mid and Valencia crop harvests but\nimproved; however, the rate of fruit drop accelerated during both harvests. Lower levels of\nproduction for the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia harvests this season resulted in lower\nlevels of pounds solid being sold, which has led to a total inventory write-down of $28.5\nmillion in fiscal year 2024. We believe that the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia box\nproduction was affected by the continued impacts of Hurricane Ian. We managed our costs\naggressively over the past year, but the lower revenue base was out of our control for the\nsecond year in a row.\nWe have several reasons to be more optimistic about our production next season. First,\nsince 2017 Alico has planted 2.2 million trees, and nearly all of them are now producing fruit.\nSecond, Alico began treating its citrus trees in January 2023 with an OTC product via trunk\ninjection as a citrus greening therapy. In 2023, we were able to treat over 35% of our\nproducing trees with OTC and in 2024, we treated approximately 4.5 million producing trees.\nAlico received $1.8 million of grant money from the Florida Citrus Research and Field Trial\nFoundation in January 2024 that covered substantially all of the costs of the 2023-24 harvest\nseason OTC applications, and $1.1 million was received in June that will cover\napproximately 34% of the 2024-25 harvest season OTC applications. Although the small\ncrop harvested this past season was not impressive, we believe that the continued recovery\nfrom Hurricane Ian was the most significant factor impacting fruit production and quality. We\nremain cautiously optimistic that being another year removed from the hurricane, along with\nthe combination of a second round of injections for previously treated trees and a first round\nof injections for trees that were not treated in 2023, will show more significant improvements,\nnot just in yield, but also in reduced fruit drop. In fact, in July it was reported that the Florida\nDepartment of Agriculture and Consumer Services approved a label change for the OTC\nproduct to remove the restriction that the product cannot be applied more than two years in a\nrow. This change will enable us to apply the OTC treatment in calendar year 2025 to the\ntrees that we started treating in 2023, which would be a relief to Alico and the Florida citrus\nindustry overall. Third, as Alico’s production recovers next season, we will sell our fruit at\nhigher prices. As we previously announced, the Company and Tropicana have extended our\nrelationship for another 3 years. With our new contract to supply Tropicana with fruit, Alico\nwill realize significantly higher prices per pound solid, which better reflect current market\npricing, with price increases in the second and third years. This new contract covers\nproduction on approximately 65% of our acres. The remainder of our acres are covered by a\ncontract with Tropicana, which expires at the end of the 2024-25 season but which also has\nhigher pricing than the expiring contracts.\nAs the Atlantic hurricane season becomes more active over the next few months, Alico is\nprepared and focused on managing its world-class citrus operations, just as it has for more\nthan 125 years. One of our greatest competitive advantages, as we face potential weather\nuncertainties, is our balance sheet liquidity. Our relationships with our lenders remain strong\nand we have approximately $94.8 million of undrawn capacity under a combination of a\nrevolving line of credit, which matures in November 2029, and a working capital line of credit,\nwhich matures in November 2025, to provide ample liquidity as our trees continue to recover\nfrom Hurricane Ian. Our $70 million of term debt does not amortize, and is not due for\nrepayment until 2029. We have steady access to workers and contractors, and our\nemployee base is stable.\nOutside of our citrus operations, Alico continues to invest resources as it evaluates the long-\nterm highest and best use of our real estate assets. To be clear, Alico will continue to\nconduct our regular citrus operations at nearly all of our groves for years to come. We will\ncontinue evaluating all of our properties to explore creative solutions to enhance and extract\nvalue. We seek to provide our investors with the benefits and stability of a conventional\nagriculture investment, with the optionality that comes with active land management. Last\nyear, after evaluating the direct hit it took from Hurricane Ian in 2022, we made a difficult\ndecision to transition our TRB grove in Charlotte County from proprietary citrus operations to\na mix of third-party mining, vegetable and fruit crop leasing activities. This year, we\nevaluated another grove and have decided to also move beyond citrus there to realize its\nhighest and best use. In 2022, Alico entered into a Purchase Option Agreement (“Option\nAgreement”) with a third party, E.R. Jahna Industries, Inc. (“Jahna”) for the sale of\napproximately 899 acres of land at a price of approximately $11,500 per acre on our 2x6\ngrove located in Hendry County, Florida, which expires in January 2025. It is expected that\nthis Option Agreement will be exercised by the end of December 2024. It is understood that\nJahna plans to conduct sand mining operations on the land once regulatory approval has\nbeen obtained, and Alico will have the right to lease back most of these acres, including 340\nnet citrus acres, for de minimis lease payments. In April 2024, we entered into an agreement\nto sell another approximately 798 acres of land at the 2x6 grove to a third party for\napproximately $7.2 million ($9,000 per acre), that includes an option to purchase another\n680 acres within ten months from the closing date of the sale, at the same price per acre\nand Alico will continue to grow citrus on those 680 acres for the next harvest season. This\npreviously announced transaction, which closed at the end of June 2024, illustrates our\nstrategy of monetizing citrus groves on a case by case basis to redeploy capital to generate\nbetter returns for our shareholders.\nIn addition to our citrus operations, Alico has been pursuing a diversified real estate strategy\nsince early 2022, which began with a comprehensive analysis of our land holdings portfolio.\nThat process encouraged us to begin the entitlement process for our 4,500 acre grove in\nCollier County. In May, we recruited Mitch Hutchcraft to lead our Real Estate activities to\naccelerate the entitlement activities at Corkscrew, as well as develop a comprehensive\nanalysis of highest and best use for remaining properties and create a roadmap to execute\nthese strategic initiatives. Alico is continuing to evaluate every acre for its highest and best\nuse, against its near-term potential for continued cash flow generation from our existing\nagricultural operations.\nI am also pleased to announce that, as part of our succession planning process, current\nboard member Adam Putnam has been selected to be appointed Chairman of the Board of\nAlico following our next Annual General Meeting to be held in 2025. Adam will succeed\nGeorge Brokaw, who has served as Chairman since February 2022 and as a Director since\nNovember 2013. George will continue to serve Alico as a Director of the Company.\nAdam has served on the Alico Board of Directors since August 2020 and has extensive\nknowledge and experience in the areas of agriculture, sustainability, government affairs,\nsupply chain, business leadership and finance. Adam has served as the Chief Executive\nOfficer of Ducks Unlimited, a U.S. nonprofit organization dedicated to the conservation of\nwetlands and associated upland habitats for waterfowl, other wildlife, and people since April\n2019. Prior to joining Ducks Unlimited, he served as Florida’s Commissioner of Agriculture\nfrom 2011 until 2019, where he focused on fostering the growth of Florida agriculture and\nprotecting the state’s water supply, among other issues, and was a U.S. Congressman for\nfive terms, from 2001 until 2011, where he engaged on issues such as agriculture, water and\nenergy. He also was the House Republican Conference Chair from 2007 until 2009. With his\npublic policy and public service experience, Adam brings to the board expertise in\nunderstanding and navigating the physical and transition risks and opportunities of climate\nchange, together with his knowledge of sustainability, water supply, and agricultural\noperations within Florida’s regulatory environment.\nOther Corporate Financial Information\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $0.5 million for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was\nprimarily due to lower employee costs (as a result of lower bonus accruals), lower\ndepreciation, lower legal costs (as a result of the voluntary dismissal of the shareholder\nlawsuit in the prior year), and lower accounting and insurance costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $0.1 million for the nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to lower\ndepreciation, legal and insurance costs, partially offset by increased employee costs.\nOther Expense, net for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $2.5 million,\ncompared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by gains of $4.4 million on the\nsale of 798 acres of citrus land during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to gains\nof $2.6 million on the sale of 548 acres of the Alico Ranch during the quarter ended June 30,\n2023.\nOther Expense, net for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased $75.2 million,\ncompared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the sale of 17,229\nacres of the Alico Ranch to the State of Florida and the sale of 798 acres of citrus land\nduring the nine months ended June 30, 2024. By comparison, for the nine months ended\nJune 30, 2023 we recognized gains on sale of property and equipment of approximately\n$7.4 million relating to the sale of 1,436 acres, in the aggregate, from the Alico Ranch to\nseveral third parties.\nDividend\nOn July 12, 2024, the Company paid a third quarter cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its\noutstanding common stock to stockholders of record as of June 28, 2024.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nThe Company continues to demonstrate financial strength within its balance sheet, as\nhighlighted below:\nThe Company’s working capital was $34.0 million at June 30, 2024, representing a\n2.67 to 1:00 ratio.\nThe Company maintains a solid debt to total assets ratio. At June 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, the ratios were 0.20 to 1.00 and 0.30 to 1.00, respectively.\nTotal debt was $84.1 million and net debt was $74.9 million at June 30, 2024,\ncompared to $128.7 million and $127.6 million, respectively, at September 30, 2023.\nAvailable borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit were approximately $94.8\nmillion at June 30, 2024.\nAbout Alico\nAlico, Inc. primarily operates two divisions: Alico Citrus, one of the nation’s largest citrus\nproducers, and Land Management and Other Operations, which includes land leasing and\nrelated support operations.

Due to significant\ndepreciable assets associated with the nature of our operations and, to a lesser extent,\ninterest costs associated with our capital structure, management believes that EBITDA,\nAdjusted EBITDA, and Net Debt are important measures to evaluate our results of\noperations between periods on a more comparable basis and to help investors analyze\nunderlying trends in our business, evaluate the performance of our business both on an\nabsolute basis and relative to our peers and the broader market, provide useful information\nto both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of\nour core operating results and operational strength of our business and help investors\nevaluate our ability to service our debt. Such measurements are not prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to reported results\ndetermined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP information provided is unique to\nAlico and may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. EBITDA is\ndefined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation,\ndepletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest\nexpense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and\nadjustments for non-recurring transactions or transactions that are not indicative of our core\noperating results, such as gains or losses on sales of real estate, property and equipment\nand assets held for sale. Net Debt is defined as Current portion of long-term debt, Long-term\ndebt, net and Lines of credit, less cash. The Company is not able to provide a quantitative\nreconciliation of its full-year 2024 guidance as to Net Debt to Current portion of long-term\ndebt, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and has not provided forward-looking\nguidance for Current portion of long-term debt because of the uncertainty around certain\nitems that may impact Current portion of long-term debt that are not within our control or\ncannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands) (Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income attributable to Alico, Inc. common\nstockholders $ (2,044) $ 11,832 $ 25,097 $ 895\nInterest expense, net 533 1,196 2,551 3,618\nIncome tax (benefit) provision (861) 1,923 9,721 306\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization 3,715 3,838 11,317 11,685\nEBITDA 1,343 18,789 48,686 16,504\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nInventory net realizable value adjustment — — 28,549 1,616\nEmployee stock compensation expense (1) 57 61 169 281\nFederal relief - Hurricane Irma — (49) — (1,315)\nInsurance proceeds - Hurricane Ian (299) (17,482) (299) (22,241)\nGain on sale of property and equipment\n(4,491) (2,605) (81,520) (7,368)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (3,390) $ (1,286) $ (4,415) $ (12,523)\n(1) Includes stock compensation expense for current executives, senior management and other employees.\nNet Debt\n(in thousands) (Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nJune 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ 1,410 $ 2,566\nLong-term debt, net 82,642 101,410\nLines of credit — 24,722\nTotal Debt 84,052 128,698\nLess: Cash (9,106) (1,062)\nNet Debt $ 74,946 $ 127,636\nSource: Alico, Inc."

We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the\nsafe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements, including\nwithout limitation, statements regarding future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products, trends, future performance or results of current and anticipated\nproducts, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, the outcome of contingencies, plans relating to dividends, government regulations, the adequacy of our liquidity to meet our\nneeds for the foreseeable future, expectations regarding income taxes, our expectations regarding the continued impact of Hurricane Ian, and our expectations regarding market\nconditions. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be\nmaterially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates”,\n“estimates”, “projects,” “intends,” “plans” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.

STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share and per acre amounts)\nNote 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nAlico, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “Alico”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), is a Florida agribusiness and land management company owning\napproximately 53,700 acres of land and approximately 48,700 acres of mineral rights throughout Florida. Alico holds these mineral rights on substantially all its owned acres,\nwith additional mineral rights on other acres. The Company manages its land based upon its primary usage, and reviews its performance based upon two primary classifications:\n(i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations. Financial results are presented based upon these two business segments.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are referred to herein as the “Financial Statements”, of Alico have been prepared pursuant to\nthe rules and regulations for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, these Financial Statements do not include all of the disclosures required for complete annual financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). As such, these Financial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on December 6, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”).\nOperating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. However, in the opinion of management,\nsuch Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP applicable to interim periods. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to\nthe current year presentation.\nSeasonality\nThe Company is primarily engaged in the production of fruit for sale to citrus markets, which is of a seasonal nature, and subject to the influence of natural phenomena and\nwide price fluctuations. Historically, the second and third quarters of Alico’s fiscal year produce most of the Company’s annual revenue. However, due to the timing of the\ncurrent year harvest, more of the citrus crop was harvested in the first and second quarters of this fiscal year. Working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and\nfourth quarters of the fiscal year, coinciding with harvesting cycles. Because of the seasonality of the business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under Financial Accounting Standards Board – Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606. The core principle of the revenue standard\nis that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company\nexpects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\n• Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer\n• Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n• Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n• Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n• Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation\n6\nTable of Contents\nRevenues are derived from the sale of processed fruit, fresh fruit, other citrus revenue, revenues from grove management services, leasing revenue and other resource revenues.\nMost of the revenue is generated from the sale of citrus fruit to processing facilities, fresh fruit sales and grove management services.\nFor fruit sales, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount it expects to be entitled to be paid, determined when control of the products or services is transferred to its\ncustomers, which occurs upon delivery of and acceptance of the fruit by the customer and when the Company has a right to payment.\nFor the sale of fruit, the Company has identified one performance obligation, which is the delivery of fruit to the processing facility of the customer (or harvesting of the citrus\nin the case of fresh fruit) for each separate variety of fruit identified in the respective contract with the respective customer. The Company initially recognizes revenue in an\namount which is estimated based on contractual and market prices, if such market price falls within the range (known as “floor” and “ceiling” prices) identified in the specific\nrespective contracts. Additionally, the Company also has a contractual agreement whereby revenue is determined based on applying a cost-plus structure methodology. As such,\nsince all these contracts contain elements of variable consideration, the Company recognizes this variable consideration by using the expected value method. On a quarterly\nbasis, management reviews the reasonableness of the revenues accrued based on buyers’ and processors’ advances to growers, cash and futures markets and experience in the\nindustry. Adjustments are made throughout the year to these estimates as more current relevant industry information becomes available. Differences between the estimates and\nthe final realization of revenues at the close of the harvesting season can result in either an increase or decrease to reported revenues.\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue recognized at a point-in-time $ 12,291 $ 6,285 $ 42,250 $ 36,939\nRevenue recognized over time 1,319 999 3,458 2,227\nTotal $ 13,610 $ 7,284 $ 45,708 $ 39,166\nReceivables under contracts, whereby pricing is based on contractual and market prices, are primarily paid at the floor amount and are collected within seven days after the\nharvest week. Any adjustments to pricing as a result of changes in market prices are generally collected or paid thirty to sixty days after final market pricing is published.\nReceivables under those contracts where pricing is based off a cost-plus structure methodology are paid at the final prior year rate. Any adjustments to pricing because of the\ncost-plus calculation are collected or paid upon finalization of the calculation and agreement by both parties. As of June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company had\ntotal receivables relating to sales of citrus of $3,840 and $394, respectively, recorded in Accounts Receivable, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor grove management services, the Company has identified one performance obligation, which is the management of the third party’s groves. Grove management services\ninclude caretaking of the citrus groves, harvesting and hauling of citrus, management and coordination of citrus sales and other related activities. The Company is reimbursed for\nexpenses incurred in the execution of its management duties and the Company receives a per acre management fee. The Company recognizes operating revenue, including a\nmanagement fee, and corresponding operating expenses when such services are rendered and consumed.\nThe Company recorded $2,341 and $978 of operating revenue relating to these grove management services, including the management fee, in the nine months ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, for this group of third-party grove owners noted above. The Company recorded $1,591 and $613 of operating expenses relating to these grove\nmanagement services in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for this group of third-party grove owners noted above.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nRevenues disaggregated by significant products and services for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n7\nTable of Contents\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAlico Citrus\nEarly and Mid-Season $ — $ — $ 14,534 $ 11,954\nValencias 12,183 6,064 26,915 23,994\nFresh Fruit and Other 108 221 801 991\nGrove Management Services 946 427 2,341 978\nTotal $ 13,237 $ 6,712 $ 44,591 $ 37,917\nLand Management and Other Operations\nLand and Other Leasing $ 302 $ 474 $ 894 $ 1,028\nOther 71 98 223 221\nTotal $ 373 $ 572 $ 1,117 $ 1,249\nTotal Revenues $ 13,610 $ 7,284 $ 45,708 $ 39,166\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers cash in banks and highly liquid instruments with an original maturity to the Company of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. At\nvarious times throughout the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and year ended September 30, 2023, some accounts held at financial institutions were in excess of the federally\ninsured limit of $250. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts and believes credit risk to be minimal.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability into a three tier\nfair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n• Level 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;\n• Level 2 – Inputs, other than the quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, for which significant other observable market inputs are readily\navailable; and\n• Level 3 – Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, such as internally developed valuation models which require the reporting entity to develop its\nown assumptions.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their\nfair values due to the short term and immediate nature of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values (Level 2) of debt instruments are as\nfollows:\n(in thousands) June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCarrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value\nCorporate debt\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ 1,410 $ 1,364 $ 2,566 $ 2,325\nLong-term debt $ 83,100 $ 75,294 $ 126,753 $ 115,851\n8\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 the Company did not have any assets held for sale that had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nAccounting for government grants\nThe Company recognizes government grants when there is reasonable assurance that: (1) the grant will be received and (2) all conditions will be met. For income-based grants,\nthe Company recognizes the income on a systemic basis over the periods in which it recognizes as expense the related costs for which the grant was intended to compensate.\nIn the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company received $2,911 of grant money from the Citrus Research and Field Trial Foundation’s (“CRAFT”) program to assist\ncitrus growers in the State of Florida using Oxytetracycline (“OTC”) and other approved therapies to combat the effect of “greening” of their citrus trees. These funds were\nrecognized as a component of Inventories ($1,106 at June 30, 2024) on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and as a reduction of Operating expenses\n($1,805 during the nine months ended June 30, 2024) on its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as the fruit was sold, in order to align it to the period over which\nthe expense related to the OTC treatments is recognized. These grant monies were received in exchange for providing certain historical data to the CRAFT Foundation about the\nCompany’s citrus groves. The $1,805 of CRAFT funds received in January of 2024 covered substantially all of the costs of the OTC application for 2023-2024 harvest and the\n$1,106 of CRAFT funds received in June 2024 will cover approximately 34% of the cost of OTC treatment for the 2024 - 2025 harvest. The Company may continue, but is not\nobligated, to participate in future CRAFT programs on the effects of the use of OTC on its Citrus Trees.\nConcentrations\nAccounts receivable from the Company’s major customer as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and revenue from such customer for the nine months ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023, are as follows:\n(in thousands) Accounts Receivable Revenue % of Total Revenue\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, September 30, June 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTropicana $ 3,218 $ — $ 40,456 $ 32,220 88.5 % 82.3 %\nThe citrus industry is subject to various factors over which growers have limited or no control, including weather conditions, disease, pestilence, water supply and market price\nfluctuations. Market prices are highly sensitive to aggregate domestic and foreign crop sizes, as well as factors including, but not limited to, weather and competition from\nforeign countries.\nThe overall increase in Tropicana revenue, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to an increase in processed fruit sales during the current quarter.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined in the criteria established under ASC Topic 280 as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn\nrevenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”)\nin deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on two operating segments: (i) Alico\nCitrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Financial Statements include the accounts of Alico and the accounts of all the subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is held by the Company. Under U.S. GAAP,\nconsolidation is generally required for investments of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of an investee, except when control is not held by the majority owner. The\nCompany’s subsidiaries include: Alico Land Development, Inc., Alico-Agri, Ltd., Alico Plant World, LLC, Alico Fruit Company, LLC, Alico Citrus Nursery, LLC, Alico\nChemical Sales, LLC, Alico Ranch, LLC, Alico Natural Resources, LLC, 734 Citrus Holdings 1, LLC and subsidiaries (“Silver Nip”), Alico Skink Mitigation, LLC and Citree\nHoldings 1, LLC\n9\nTable of Contents\n(“Citree”). The Company considers the criteria established under FASB ASC Topic 810, “Consolidations” in its consolidation process. All significant intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities as of the date of the accompanying Financial Statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the\naccompanying Notes, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and cash flows during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The\nCompany evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis. The estimates are based on current and expected economic conditions, historical experience, the experience and judgment of\nthe Company’s management and various other specific assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable.\nNoncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Subsidiary\nThe Financial Statements include all assets and liabilities of the less-than-100%-owned subsidiary the Company controls, Citree. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a\nnoncontrolling interest in the equity of such entity. Citree had net income of $276 and $490 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net losses of\n$1,190 and $286 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which5 1% is attributable to the Company.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which amends Topic 280 primarily through enhanced disclosures\nabout significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2023-07 will become effective for us on October 1, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the\nadoption of this accounting pronouncement on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which amends Topic 740 primarily through enhanced disclosures about an\nentity’s tax risks and tax planning. The amendments are effective for public business entities in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption\npermitted on a prospective or retrospective basis. ASU 2023-09 will become effective for us on October 1, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the\nadoption of this accounting pronouncement on its tax disclosures but it does not impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nNote 3. Inventories\nInventories consist of the following at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n(in thousands)\nJune 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nUnharvested fruit crop on the trees $ 34,980 $ 50,699\nOther 1,018 1,782\nTotal inventories $ 35,998 $ 52,481\nThe Company records its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company recorded $28,549 and $1,616, respectively, for adjustments to reduce inventory to net realizable\nvalue, within Operating expenses. The adjustment for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was due to significantly lower than anticipated harvests of the Early and Mid-Season\nand Valencia crops, as a result of the continued recovery from the impacts of Hurricane Ian.\nThe Company received $299 of insurance proceeds relating to Hurricane Ian during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as part of a final true-up of amounts due. In\nthe three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company received insurance proceeds relating to Hurricane Ian of approximately $16,643 and $21,403 for crop claims,\nwhich have been recorded in operating expenses.\n10\nTable of Contents\nIn the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company received $0 and approximately $1,315 under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant (“CRBG”)\nprogram. These federal relief proceeds are included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNote 4.

When these lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components (e.g.,\ncommon area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.\nAny lease arrangements with an initial term of one year or less are not recorded on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and it recognizes lease cost for\nthese lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term. Many lease arrangements provide the options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to\nterminate the lease arrangement. The Company includes these options when it will be reasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish the right-of-use\nassets and lease liabilities. Generally, lease agreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the\ncommencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments.\nNo lease costs associated with finance leases and sale-leaseback transactions occurred and our lease income associated with lessor and sublease arrangements are not material to\nour Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur operating leases cost components are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\nOperating lease components 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating leases costs recorded in general and administrative\nexpenses $ 37 $ 30 $ 111 $ 91\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:\nJune 30, 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 2.2 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 5.49 %\n16\nTable of Contents\nNote 11.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto and other\ninformation included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other filings with the SEC. Our actual results of operations may\ndiffer materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those included our 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and other portions of this Quarterly Report. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in\nthe future. In the following discussion and analysis, dollars are in thousands, except per share and per acre amounts.\nBusiness Overview\nBusiness Description\nAlico, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “Alico”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) generates operating revenues primarily from the sale of our citrus\nproducts, providing management services to citrus groves owned by third parties, and grazing and hunting leasing. We operate as two business segments, and all of our\noperating revenues are generated in the United States. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we generated operating revenue of $13,610 and $7,284,\nrespectively, (loss) income from operations of $(6,728) and $12,572, respectively, and net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders of $(2,044) and $11,832,\nrespectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $18,720 and $618 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\nBusiness Segments\nOperating segments are defined in the criteria established under FASB ASC Topic 280 as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may\nearn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by our CODM in deciding how to assess performance\nand allocate resources. Our CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on its operating segments.\nOur two segments are as follows:\n• Alico Citrus includes activities related to planting, owning, cultivating and/or managing citrus groves to produce fruit for sale to fresh and processed citrus\nmarkets, including activities related to the purchase and resale of fruit and value-added services, which include contracting for the harvesting, marketing and\nhauling of citrus; and\n• Land Management and Other Operations includes activities related to grazing and hunting leasing, management and/or conservation of unimproved native\npastureland and activities related to rock mining royalties and other insignificant lines of business. Also included are activities related to owning and/or leasing\nimproved farmland. Improved farmland is acreage that has been converted, or is permitted to be converted, from native pasture and which may have various\nimprovements including irrigation, drainage and roads.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Alico Citrus segment generated 97.3% and 92.1%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues and the Land\nManagement and Other Operations segment generated 2.7% and 7.9%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Alico Citrus segment generated 97.6% and 96.8%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues and the Land\nManagement and Other Operations segment generated 2.4% and 3.2%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.\n19\nTable of Contents\nRecent Developments\nTropicana Orange Purchase Agreement\nOn June 5, 2024, we entered a new three-year Orange Purchase Agreement (the “Tropicana Agreement”) to sell oranges to Tropicana at prices that are approximately 33% to\n50% higher, over the life of the contract, than the average price for all the citrus fruit sold to Tropicana last season. The Tropicana Agreement is effective June 5, 2024 through\nJuly 31, 2027, subject to its terms and conditions, and succeeds existing agreements with Tropicana that expired at the end of July 2024.\nCitrus Research and Field Trial Foundation\nIn June 2024, we received $1,106 from CRAFT of grower’s support payments in connection with our use of OTC, to combat the effect of “greening” in our citrus trees.\nLand Sale\nOn June 28, 2024, we sold 798 acres of citrus land for approximately $7,183 ($9,000 per acre).\n20\nTable of Contents\nCondensed Consolidated Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 2023:\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended June\n30, Change Nine Months Ended June 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nOperating revenues:\nAlico Citrus $ 13,237 $ 6,712 $ 6,525 97.2 % $ 44,591 $ 37,917 $ 6,674 17.6 %\nLand Management and Other\nOperations 373 572 (199) (34.8)% 1,117 1,249 (132) (10.6)%\nTotal operating revenues 13,610 7,284 6,326 86.8 % 45,708 39,166 6,542 16.7 %\nGross (loss) profit:\nAlico Citrus (4,576) 15,034 (19,610) (130.4)% (37,471) 4,424 (41,895) (947.0)%\nLand Management and Other\nOperations 289 468 (179) (38.2)% 771 949 (178) (18.8)%\nTotal gross (loss) profit (4,287) 15,502 (19,789) (127.7)% (36,700) 5,373 (42,073) (783.0)%\nGeneral and administrative expenses 2,441 2,930 (489) (16.7)% 8,034 8,106 (72) (0.9 %)\n(Loss) income from operations (6,728) 12,572 (19,300) (153.5)% (44,734) (2,733) (42,001) NM\nTotal other expense, net 3,958 1,423 2,535 178.1 % 78,969 3,794 75,175 NM\n(Loss) income before income taxes (2,770) 13,995 (16,765) (119.8)% 34,235 1,061 33,174 NM\nIncome tax (benefit) provision (861) 1,923 (2,784) (144.8 %) 9,721 306 9,415 NM\nNet (loss) income (1,909) 12,072 (13,981) (115.8)% 24,514 755 23,759 NM\nNet (loss) income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests (135) (240) 105 (43.8)% 583 140 443 316.4 %\nNet (loss) income attributable to Alico,\nInc. common stockholders $ (2,044) $ 11,832 $ (13,876) (117.3)% $ 25,097 $ 895 $ 24,202 NM\nNM = Not meaningful\nOperating Revenue\nThe 86.8% increase in revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to the timing of the Valencia\nharvest, which is discussed in further detail below.\nThe 16.7% increase in revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in pound solids\nproduced as we began to recover to pre-hurricane levels and an increase in the price per pound solids for both the Early and Mid-season and Valencia crops, as a result of more\nfavorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana, which is discussed in further detail below. In addition, there was an increase\n21\nTable of Contents\nin Grove Management Services revenue as a result of the Citrus Grove Management Agreement we entered into on October 30, 2023 (the “Grove Owners Agreement”) with an\nunaffiliated group of third parties (the “Grove Owners”) to provide citrus grove caretaking services for approximately 3,300 acres owned by such third parties for the nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nThe increase in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily driven by\ninsurance proceeds of $16,643 and $21,403 for crop claims received during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 (the “Crop Insurance Proceeds”), which were\nrecorded as a reduction of operating expenses. In addition, the increase in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 was impacted by a combination\nof the inventory adjustments recorded at September 30, 2022 on the ending inventory balance, as a result of the impact of Hurricane Ian, which effectively lowered the\ninventory to be expensed in fiscal year 2023, as well as a 103.1% and 15.1% increase in the number of boxes which needed to be harvested in the three and nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024, respectively. See Note 3. Inventories to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $489 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily\ndue to lower employee costs (as a result of lower bonus accruals), lower depreciation, lower legal costs (as a result of the voluntary dismissal of the shareholder lawsuit in the\nprior year), and lower accounting and insurance costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $72 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to lower\ndepreciation, legal and insurance costs, partially offset by increased employee costs.\nOther Expense, net\nOther Expense, net for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $2,535, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by gains of $4,396 on the sale of 798\nacres of citrus land during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to gains of $2,613 on the sale of 548 acres of the Alico Ranch during the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\nOther Expense, net for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased $75,175, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the sale of 17,229 acres of\nthe Alico Ranch to the State of Florida and the sale of 798 acres of citrus land during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. By comparison, for the nine months ended June 30,\n2023 we recognized gains on sale of property and equipment of approximately $7,368 relating to the sale of 1,436 acres, in the aggregate, from the Alico Ranch to several third\nparties.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in the income tax (benefit) provision of $(2,784) for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was driven by a\npre-tax loss for the current period, as opposed to pre-tax income in the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe increase in the income tax (benefit) provision of $9,415 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was principally due\nto the gain on the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch to the State of Florida in the current year, while the income tax provision for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was\ndue to the lower pre-tax income generated for the period.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of our operating segments:\nAlico Citrus\n(in thousands, except per box and per pound solids data)\nThree Months Ended June 30, Change Nine Months Ended June 30, Change\n2024 2023 Unit % 2024 2023 Unit %\nOperating Revenues:\nEarly and Mid-Season $ — $ — $ — — $ 14,534 $ 11,954 $ 2,580 21.6 %\nValencias 12,183 6,064 6,119 100.9 % 26,915 23,994 2,921 12.2 %\nFresh Fruit and Other 108 221 (113) (51.1)% 801 991 (190) (19.2)%\nGrove Management Services 946 427 519 121.5 % 2,341 978 1,363 139.4 %\nTotal $ 13,237 $ 6,712 $ 6,525 97.2 % $ 44,591 $ 37,917 $ 6,674 17.6 %\nBoxes Harvested:\nEarly and Mid-Season — — — — 1,194 979 215 22.0 %\nValencias 843 415 428 103.1 % 1,855 1,669 186 11.1 %\nTotal Processed 843 415 428 103.1 % 3,049 2,648 401 15.1 %\nFresh Fruit — 1 (1) (100.0)% 35 41 (6) (14.6)%\nTotal 843 416 427 102.6 % 3,084 2,689 395 14.7 %\nPound Solids Produced:\nEarly and Mid-Season — — — — 5,364 4,586 778 17.0 %\nValencias 4,294 2,142 2,152 100.5 % 9,365 8,702 663 7.6 %\nTotal 4,294 2,142 2,152 100.5 % 14,729 13,288 1,441 10.8 %\nPound Solids per Box:\nEarly and Mid-Season — — — — 4.49 4.68 (0.19) (4.0)%\nValencias 5.09 5.16 (0.07) (1.3)% 5.05 5.21 (0.16) (3.1)%\nPrice per Pound Solids:\nEarly and Mid-Season $ — $ — $ — — $ 2.71 $ 2.61 $ 0.10 3.8 %\nValencias $ 2.84 $ 2.83 $ 0.01 0.3 % $ 2.87 $ 2.76 $ 0.11 4.1 %\nPrice per Box:\nFresh Fruit $ — NM $ — — $ 15.89 $ 14.02 $ 1.87 13.3 %\nOperating Expenses:\nCost of Sales $ 14,038 $ 6,603 $ 7,435 112.6 % $ 68,857 $ 45,647 $ 23,210 50.8 %\nHarvesting and Hauling 3,296 2,047 1,249 61.0 % 11,843 10,573 1,270 12.0 %\nFresh Fruit and Other (222) (17,278) 17,056 (98.7)% (229) (23,340) 23,111 (99.0)%\nGrove Management Services 701 306 395 129.1 % 1,591 613 978 159.5 %\nTotal $ 17,813 $ (8,322) $ 26,135 (314.0)% $ 82,062 $ 33,493 $ 48,569 145.0 %\n23\nTable of Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations for Alico Citrus Segment\nWe sell our Early and Mid-Season and Valencia oranges to orange juice processors. The processors generally buy the citrus crop on a pound solids basis, which is the measure\nof the soluble solids (sugars and acids) contained in one box of fruit. Our Fresh Fruit revenue is derived from sales to packing houses that purchase the citrus on a per box basis.\nWe also provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services to third parties from which revenues are recorded as Grove Management Services, including\na management fee. Other revenues consist of the purchase and reselling of fruit.\nOperating expenses for our Alico Citrus segment consist primarily of Cost of Sales, Harvesting and Hauling costs and Grove Management Service costs. Cost of Sales\nrepresents the cost of maintaining the citrus groves for the preceding calendar year and does not vary in relation to production. Harvesting and Hauling costs represent the costs\nof bringing citrus product to processors and vary based upon the number of boxes produced. Grove Management Services costs include those costs associated with citrus grove\ncaretaking and harvest and haul management services provided to third parties. Other expenses include the period costs of third-party grove caretaking and the purchase and\nreselling of third-party fruit.\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 for the Alico Citrus Segment\nThe 97.2% increase in revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a 100.5% increase in pound\nsolids, driven by a combination of factors related to the timing of the Valencia harvest, which started later this year to allow the fruit more time to mature, as compared to an\nacceleration of the harvest in the prior year as a result of Hurricane Ian, to try to mitigate the fruit drop.\nThe 17.6% increase in revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to an 10.8% increase in pound\nsolids produced as the trees continue to recover from the effects of Hurricane Ian, an increase in the price per pound solids for both the Early and Mid-season and Valencia crops\nas a result of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana, and an increase in Grove Management Services revenue as a result of the signing of the Grove\nOwners Agreement. Although Hurricane Ian initially impacted the fiscal year 2023 harvest, we expect it may take another season, or more, for the groves to recover to pre-\nhurricane production levels.\nThe Early and Mid-Season harvest was completed in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024 the pound solids per box decreased 4.0%,\nand the processed box production increased 22.0%, compared to the same nine month period in the prior year. Although the overall decrease in pound solids per box for the\nseason was disappointing, the increase in total boxes produced demonstrates that the groves are beginning to recover from the effects of Hurricane Ian. In addition, there was an\nincrease in the price per pound solids of 3.8% in the Early and Mid-Season fruit harvested for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior\nyear, as a result of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana.\nThe Valencia harvest was completed for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and pound solids per box decreased 1.3% and 3.1%, respectively, and the processed box\nproduction increased 103.1% and 11.1%, respectively, compared to the same three and nine month periods in the prior year. In addition, there was an increase in the price per\npound solids of 0.3% and 4.1% in the Valencia fruit harvested for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year,\nas a result of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana.\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized a decrease in revenue from sales of Fresh Fruit and Other of $113 and $190, respectively, compared to the\nsame periods in the prior year, driven by a decrease in the amount of fruit that was resold on behalf of grove owners.\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 from the grove owners relating to Grove Management Services increased 121.5% and 139.4%, respectively,\ncompared to the prior year, principally due to the signing of the Grove Owners Agreement in October 2023.\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized an increase in Cost of Sales of $7,435 and $23,210, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior\nyear, which was driven by a combination of the inventory adjustments recorded at September 30, 2022 on the ending inventory balance as a result of the impact of Hurricane\nIan, which effectively lowered the inventory to be expensed in fiscal year 2023, as well as a 103.1% and 15.1% increase in\n24\nTable of Contents\nboxes harvested in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.\nFor the three month period ended June 30, 2024, Harvest and Hauling expenses increased $1,249, compared to the prior year period, driven by the increase in the number of\nboxes produced for the period as a result of the timing of our harvest. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, Harvesting and Hauling expenses were up $1,270, when\ncompared to the same period in the prior year, driven by the increase in the number of boxes produced for the period as we continue to recover from the impact of Hurricane Ian.\nFor the three and nine month periods ended June 30, 2024, the credit amounts shown in “Fresh Fruit and Other” in operating expenses above primarily represent a final true-up\nof Crop Insurance Proceeds from Hurricane Ian, received in the current period. For the three and nine month periods ended June 30, 2023, the credit amounts primarily\nrepresent the Crop Insurance Proceeds of $16,643 and $21,403, respectively, which were recorded as a reduction of operating expenses, and includes $1,315 in federal relief\nproceeds received under the CRBG program in the nine months ended June 30, 2023.\nThere was a 129.1% and 159.5% increase in operating expenses relating to grove management services for the Grove Owners for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, primarily due to the new Grove Owners Agreement.\nLand Management and Other Operations\nThe table below presents key operating measures for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 for the Land Management and Other Operations segment:\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended June 30, Change Nine Months Ended June 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nRevenue From:\nLand and Other Leasing $ 302 $ 474 $ (172) (36.3)% $ 894 $ 1,028 $ (134) (13.0)%\nOther 71 98 (27) (27.6)% 223 221 2 0.9 %\nTotal $ 373 $ 572 $ (199) (34.8)% $ 1,117 $ 1,249 $ (132) (10.6)%\nOperating Expenses:\nLand and Other Leasing $ 84 $ 104 $ (20) (19.2)% $ 341 $ 295 $ 46 15.6 %\nOther — — — — 5 5 — —\nTotal $ 84 $ 104 $ (20) (19.2)% $ 346 $ 300 $ 46 15.3 %\nComponents of Results of Operations for Land Management and Other Operations Segment\nLand and Other Leasing includes lease income from leases for grazing rights, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction\nrights to third parties, and other miscellaneous income.\nLand and Other Leasing operating expenses includes real estate, property taxes, general and administrative expenses including salaries, benefits and legal.\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 for the Land Management and Other Operations Segment\nLand Management and Other Operations revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 decreased 34.8% and 10.6%, respectively, as compared to the same period\nin the prior year principally due to a decrease in hunting lease revenue as a result of the sale of the ranch land.\nThe decrease in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30,\n2023, was primarily due to a decrease in property taxes related to land sales. The increase in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the nine\nmonths ended\n25\nTable of Contents\nJune 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in mining permitting costs, offset by a decrease in property taxes related\nto land sales.\nSeasonality\nWe are primarily engaged in the production of fruit for sale to citrus markets, which is of a seasonal nature, and subject to the influence of natural phenomena and wide price\nfluctuations. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year produce most of our annual revenue. However, due to the timing of the current year harvest, more of\nthe citrus crop was harvested in the first and second quarters of this fiscal year. Working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal\nyear, coinciding with harvesting cycles. Because of the seasonality of the business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for\nthe full fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA comparative balance sheet summary is presented in the following table:\n(in thousands)\nJune 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nCash and cash equivalents $ 9,106 $ 1,062 $ 8,044\nTotal current assets $ 54,364 $ 58,805 $ (4,441)\nTotal current liabilities $ 20,358 $ 15,065 $ 5,293\nWorking capital $ 34,006 $ 43,740 $ (9,734)\nTotal assets $ 414,602 $ 428,353 $ (13,751)\nPrincipal amount of term loans and lines of credit $ 84,510 $ 129,319 $ (44,809)\nWorking capital ratio 2.67 to 1 3.90 to 1\nDebt to total assets ratio 0.20 to 1 0.30 to 1\nSources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\nOur business has historically generated full fiscal year positive net cash flows from operating activities, although the net cash flow in the first quarter of each fiscal year has\nbeen negative because of seasonality and the associated need to expend cash in advance of generating revenues from the harvesting season. Sources of cash primarily include\ncash flows from operations, sales of under-performing land and other assets, amounts available under our credit facilities, and access to capital markets. Access to additional\nborrowings under revolving lines of credit is subject to the satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions. As a public company, we may have access to other sources of\ncapital. However, access to, and availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including (i) financial condition, prospects, and\ncredit rating; (ii) liquidity of the overall capital markets; and (iii) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets\non acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe principal uses of cash that affect our liquidity position include the following: operating expenses including employee costs, the cost of maintaining the citrus groves,\nharvesting and hauling of citrus products, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, dividends, debt service costs including interest and principal payments on term loans and\nother credit facilities and acquisitions. Although the current year tax provision is recorded within Income taxes payable on our balance sheet, as required by U.S. GAAP; we do\nnot expect to pay any further income taxes for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The income tax payable is expected to be reclassified to Deferred income tax\nliabilities, net, at year-end, as we anticipate utilizing a portion of our prior year net operating loss carryover.\nManagement believes that a combination of cash-on-hand, cash generated from operations, and asset sales and availability under our lines of credit will provide sufficient\nliquidity to service the principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and will satisfy working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve\nmonths and over the long term. However, this is subject, to a certain extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our\ncontrol.\n26\nTable of Contents\nBorrowing Facilities and Long-term Debt\nWe have a $70,000 working capital line of credit and a $25,000 revolving line of credit, of which $69,752 and $25,000 was available for general use as of June 30, 2024 (see\nNote 7. Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We may utilize the available cash to pay down indebtedness,\npursue citrus grove acquisitions, conduct share repurchases, and possibly reinstate increased dividends. If we choose to pursue significant growth and other corporate\nopportunities, these actions could have a material adverse impact on our cash balances and may require us to finance such activities by drawing down on our lines of credit or\nby obtaining additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained\non commercially reasonable terms. Any inability to obtain additional financing could adversely impact our ability to pursue different growth and other corporate opportunities.\nThe level of debt could have important consequences on our business, including, but not limited to, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry\nconditions, limiting the availability of cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements,\nand limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and industry.\nOur credit facilities are subject to various debt covenants including the following financial covenants: (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00; (ii) tangible net\nworth of at least $160,000 increased annually by 10% of consolidated net income for the preceding years, or $174,628 applicable for the year ended September 30, 2023; (iii)\nminimum current ratio of 1.50 to 1.00; (iv) debt to total assets ratio not greater than 0.625 to 1.00; and (v) solely in the case of the WCLC, a limit on capital expenditures of\n$30,000 per fiscal year. As of June 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants.\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents increased from $1,592 as of June 30, 2023, to $9,106 as of June 30, 2024. The components of these changes are discussed below.\n(in thousands) Nine Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nNet cash (used in) operating activities $ (18,720) $ (618) $ (18,102)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 70,088 (5,718) 75,806\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (45,954) 7,063 (53,017)\nNet increase in cash and restricted cash $ 5,414 $ 727 $ 4,687\nNet Cash (Used In) Operating Activities\nThe $(18,102) increase in Net Cash (used in) operating activities was driven by Crop Insurance Proceeds of $21,403 during the nine months ended June 30, 2023, partially\noffset by increased revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nThe $75,806 increase in Net Cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was\nprimarily due to proceeds from the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch and the 798 acres of citrus land.\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities\nThe increase of $(53,017) in Net Cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023,\nwas primarily due to the repayment of the WCLC and the $19,094 Met Life Variable-Rate Term debt with the proceeds from the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch, as\ncompared to an increase in net borrowings under the WCLC in the same period in the prior year.\nWe had $0 and $17,910 outstanding on our revolving lines of credit as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe WCLC agreement provides for Rabo Agrifinance, Inc. to issue up to $2,000 in letters of credit on our behalf. As of June 30, 2024, there was $248 in outstanding letters of\ncredit, which correspondingly reduced our availability under the WCLC.\nContractual Obligations\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations are described in the accompanying notes to the financial statements withinP art I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report. These include principal and interest payments on long-term debt as described in Note 7. Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, operating leases as described in\nNote 10. Leases and purchase commitments as described in Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this\nQuarterly Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have\nbeen prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience,\navailable current market information and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, the Company evaluates\nthe results of these estimates on an on-going basis. Management’s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nSee Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for a detailed\ndescription of recent accounting pronouncements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates from those reflected in the\nCompany’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n28\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk - We are subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments such as term loan debt and other borrowings. Our primary long-term\nobligations are fixed rate debts subject to fair value risk due to interest rate fluctuations. See Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to these Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are also subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt; however, at June 30, 2024, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding.\nIn the three months ended June 30, 2024, there were no other material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from those discussed in Part II,\nItem 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 6, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nLimitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are\nresource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as\nsuch term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024 there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n29\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products, trends, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, the outcome of contingencies, plans relating to dividends, government regulations, the adequacy of our liquidity to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, expectations regarding income taxes, our expectations regarding the continued impact of Hurricane Ian, and our expectations regarding market conditions. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates”, “estimates”, “projects,” “intends,” “plans” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change and hurricanes and tropical storms, particularly because our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida; damage and loss from disease including, but not limited to, citrus greening and citrus canker; any adverse event affecting our citrus business; our ability to effectively perform grove management services, or to effectively manage an expanded portfolio of groves; our dependency on our relationship with Tropicana and Tropicana’s relationship with certain third parties for a significant portion of our business; our ability to execute our strategic growth initiatives and whether they adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face; product contamination and product liability claims; water use regulations restricting our access to water; changes in immigration laws; harm to our reputation; tax risks associated with a Section 1031 Exchange; risks associated with the undertaking of one or more significant corporate transactions; the seasonality of our citrus business; fluctuations in our earnings due to market supply and prices and demand for our products; climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change; Environmental, Social and Governance issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability; increases in labor, personnel and benefits costs; increases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs; transportation risks; any change or the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers related to our real estate taxes; liability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances; compliance with applicable environmental laws; loss of key employees; material weaknesses and other control deficiencies relating to our internal control over financial reporting; macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation and the deadly conflicts in Ukraine and Israel; system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues; our indebtedness and ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations; higher interest expenses as a result of variable rates of interest for our debt; our ability to continue to pay cash dividends; and the other factors described under the sections “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 6, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”). Except as required by law, we do not undertake an obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\n\nAs used in this Quarterly Report, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Alico” refer to the operations of Alico, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nALICO, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n\n(in thousands, except share amounts)June 30,2024| September 30,2023  \n---|---  \n(Unaudited)  \nASSETS  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 9,106 | $| 1,062  \nAccounts receivable, net| 4,512 | 712  \nInventories| 35,998 | 52,481  \nIncome tax receivable| — | 1,200  \nAssets held for sale| 3,106 | 1,632  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets| 1,642 | 1,718  \nTotal current assets| 54,364 | 58,805  \nRestricted cash| — | 2,630  \nProperty and equipment, net| 355,255 | 361,849  \nGoodwill| 2,246 | 2,246  \nOther non-current assets| 2,737 | 2,823  \nTotal assets| $| 414,602 | $| 428,353  \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| $| 6,632 | $| 6,311  \nAccrued liabilities| 4,618 | 5,363  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt| 1,410 | 2,566  \nIncome tax payable| 7,171 | —  \nOther current liabilities| 527 | 825  \nTotal current liabilities| 20,358 | 15,065  \nLong-term debt, net| 82,642 | 101,410  \nLines of credit| — | 24,722  \nDeferred income tax liabilities, net| 36,868 | 36,410  \nOther liabilities| 442 | 369  \nTotal liabilities| 140,310 | 177,976  \nCommitments and Contingencies - Note 12.   \nStockholders’ equity:  \nPreferred stock, no par value, 1,000,000 shares authorized; none issued| — | —  \nCommon stock, $1.00 par value, 15,000,000 shares authorized; 8,416,145 shares issued and 7,624,185 and 7,610,551 shares outstanding at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively| 8,416 | 8,416  \nAdditional paid in capital| 20,153 | 20,045  \nTreasury stock, at cost, 791,960 and 806,341 shares held at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively| (26,838)| (27,274)  \nRetained earnings| 267,758 | 243,804  \nTotal Alico stockholders’ equity| 269,489 | 244,991  \nNoncontrolling interest| 4,803 | 5,386  \nTotal stockholders’ equity| 274,292 | 250,377  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity| $| 414,602 | $| 428,353  \n  \nSee accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n1\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nALICO, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)\n\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\nThree Months EndedJune 30,| Nine Months EndedJune 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nOperating revenues:  \nAlico Citrus| $| 13,237 | $| 6,712 | $| 44,591 | $| 37,917  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 373 | 572 | 1,117 | 1,249  \nTotal operating revenues| 13,610 | 7,284 | 45,708 | 39,166  \nOperating expenses:  \nAlico Citrus| 17,813 | (8,322)| 82,062 | 33,493  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 84 | 104 | 346 | 300  \nTotal operating expenses| 17,897 | (8,218)| 82,408 | 33,793  \nGross (loss) profit| (4,287)| 15,502 | (36,700)| 5,373  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 2,441 | 2,930 | 8,034 | 8,106  \n(Loss) income from operations| (6,728)| 12,572 | (44,734)| (2,733)  \nOther expense, net:  \nInterest income| 95 | — | 345 | —  \nInterest expense| (628)| (1,196)| (2,896)| (3,618)  \nGain on property and equipment| 4,491 | 2,605 | 81,520 | 7,368  \nOther income, net| — | 14 | — | 44  \nTotal other expense, net| 3,958 | 1,423 | 78,969 | 3,794  \n(Loss) income before income taxes| (2,770)| 13,995 | 34,235 | 1,061  \nIncome tax (benefit) provision| (861)| 1,923 | 9,721 | 306  \nNet (loss) income| (1,909)| 12,072 | 24,514 | 755  \nNet (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests| (135)| (240)| 583 | 140  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Alico, Inc. common stockholders| $| (2,044)| $| 11,832 | $| 25,097 | $| 895  \nPer share information attributable to Alico, Inc. common stockholders:  \nEarnings per common share:  \nBasic| $| (0.27)| $| 1.56 | $| 3.29 | $| 0.12  \nDiluted| $| (0.27)| $| 1.56 | $| 3.29 | $| 0.12  \nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding:  \nBasic| 7,624| 7,605| 7,620| 7,599  \nDiluted| 7,624| 7,605| 7,620| 7,599  \nCash dividends declared per common share| $| 0.05 | $| 0.05 | $| 0.15 | $| 0.15  \n  \nSee accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n2\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nALICO, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY (UNAUDITED)\n\n(in thousands)\n\nFor the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024  \n---  \nCommon stock| Additional Paid In Capital | Treasury Stock | Retained Earnings | Total Alico, Inc.

Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\n\nDescription of Business\n\nAlico, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “Alico”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), is a Florida agribusiness and land management company owning approximately 53,700 acres of land and approximately 48,700 acres of mineral rights throughout Florida. Alico holds these mineral rights on substantially all its owned acres, with additional mineral rights on other acres. The Company manages its land based upon its primary usage, and reviews its performance based upon two primary classifications: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations. Financial results are presented based upon these two business segments.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are referred to herein as the “Financial Statements”, of Alico have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, these Financial Statements do not include all of the disclosures required for complete annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). As such, these Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on December 6, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”). \n\nOperating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. However, in the opinion of management, such Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP applicable to interim periods. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nSeasonality\n\nThe Company is primarily engaged in the production of fruit for sale to citrus markets, which is of a seasonal nature, and subject to the influence of natural phenomena and wide price fluctuations. Historically, the second and third quarters of Alico’s fiscal year produce most of the Company’s annual revenue. However, due to the timing of the current year harvest, more of the citrus crop was harvested in the first and second quarters of this fiscal year. Working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, coinciding with harvesting cycles. Because of the seasonality of the business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under Financial Accounting Standards Board – Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606. The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\n\n•Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer\n\n•Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n\n•Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n\n•Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\n•Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation\n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nRevenues are derived from the sale of processed fruit, fresh fruit, other citrus revenue, revenues from grove management services, leasing revenue and other resource revenues. Most of the revenue is generated from the sale of citrus fruit to processing facilities, fresh fruit sales and grove management services. \n\nFor fruit sales, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount it expects to be entitled to be paid, determined when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers, which occurs upon delivery of and acceptance of the fruit by the customer and when the Company has a right to payment.\n\nFor the sale of fruit, the Company has identified one performance obligation, which is the delivery of fruit to the processing facility of the customer (or harvesting of the citrus in the case of fresh fruit) for each separate variety of fruit identified in the respective contract with the respective customer. The Company initially recognizes revenue in an amount which is estimated based on contractual and market prices, if such market price falls within the range (known as “floor” and “ceiling” prices) identified in the specific respective contracts. Additionally, the Company also has a contractual agreement whereby revenue is determined based on applying a cost-plus structure methodology. As such, since all these contracts contain elements of variable consideration, the Company recognizes this variable consideration by using the expected value method. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the reasonableness of the revenues accrued based on buyers’ and processors’ advances to growers, cash and futures markets and experience in the industry. Adjustments are made throughout the year to these estimates as more current relevant industry information becomes available. Differences between the estimates and the final realization of revenues at the close of the harvesting season can result in either an increase or decrease to reported revenues. \n\n(in thousands)| Three Months EndedJune 30,| Nine Months EndedJune 30,  \n---|---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nRevenue recognized at a point-in-time| $| 12,291 | $| 6,285 | $| 42,250 | $| 36,939  \nRevenue recognized over time| 1,319 | 999 | 3,458 | 2,227  \nTotal| $| 13,610 | $| 7,284 | $| 45,708 | $| 39,166  \n  \nReceivables under contracts, whereby pricing is based on contractual and market prices, are primarily paid at the floor amount and are collected within seven days after the harvest week. Any adjustments to pricing as a result of changes in market prices are generally collected or paid thirty to sixty days after final market pricing is published. Receivables under those contracts where pricing is based off a cost-plus structure methodology are paid at the final prior year rate. Any adjustments to pricing because of the cost-plus calculation are collected or paid upon finalization of the calculation and agreement by both parties. As of June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company had total receivables relating to sales of citrus of $3,840 and $394, respectively, recorded in Accounts Receivable, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor grove management services, the Company has identified one performance obligation, which is the management of the third party’s groves. Grove management services include caretaking of the citrus groves, harvesting and hauling of citrus, management and coordination of citrus sales and other related activities. The Company is reimbursed for expenses incurred in the execution of its management duties and the Company receives a per acre management fee. The Company recognizes operating revenue, including a management fee, and corresponding operating expenses when such services are rendered and consumed.\n\nThe Company recorded $2,341 and $978 of operating revenue relating to these grove management services, including the management fee, in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for this group of third-party grove owners noted above. The Company recorded $1,591 and $613 of operating expenses relating to these grove management services in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for this group of third-party grove owners noted above.\n\nDisaggregated Revenue\n\nRevenues disaggregated by significant products and services for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\n(in thousands)| Three Months EndedJune 30,| Nine Months EndedJune 30,  \n---|---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nAlico Citrus  \nEarly and Mid-Season| $| — | $| — | $| 14,534 | $| 11,954  \nValencias| 12,183 | 6,064 | 26,915 | 23,994  \nFresh Fruit and Other| 108 | 221 | 801 | 991  \nGrove Management Services| 946 | 427 | 2,341 | 978  \nTotal| $| 13,237 | $| 6,712 | $| 44,591 | $| 37,917  \nLand Management and Other Operations  \nLand and Other Leasing| $| 302 | $| 474 | $| 894 | $| 1,028  \nOther| 71 | 98 | 223 | 221  \nTotal| $| 373 | $| 572 | $| 1,117 | $| 1,249  \nTotal Revenues| $| 13,610 | $| 7,284 | $| 45,708 | $| 39,166  \n  \nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nThe Company considers cash in banks and highly liquid instruments with an original maturity to the Company of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. At various times throughout the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and year ended September 30, 2023, some accounts held at financial institutions were in excess of the federally insured limit of $250. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts and believes credit risk to be minimal.\n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability into a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: \n\n•Level 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;\n\n•Level 2 – Inputs, other than the quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, for which significant other observable market inputs are readily available; and \n\n•Level 3 – Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, such as internally developed valuation models which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. \n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short term and immediate nature of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values (Level 2) of debt instruments are as follows: \n\n(in thousands)| June 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nCarrying Amount| Estimated Fair Value| Carrying Amount| Estimated Fair Value  \nCorporate debt  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt| $| 1,410 | $| 1,364 | $| 2,566 | $| 2,325  \nLong-term debt| $| 83,100 | $| 75,294 | $| 126,753 | $| 115,851  \n  \n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 the Company did not have any assets held for sale that had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\n\nAccounting for government grants\n\nThe Company recognizes government grants when there is reasonable assurance that: (1) the grant will be received and (2) all conditions will be met. For income-based grants, the Company recognizes the income on a systemic basis over the periods in which it recognizes as expense the related costs for which the grant was intended to compensate.\n\nIn the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company received $2,911 of grant money from the Citrus Research and Field Trial Foundation’s (“CRAFT”) program to assist citrus growers in the State of Florida using Oxytetracycline (“OTC”) and other approved therapies to combat the effect of “greening” of their citrus trees. These funds were recognized as a component of Inventories ($1,106 at June 30, 2024) on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and as a reduction of Operating expenses ($1,805 during the nine months ended June 30, 2024) on its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as the fruit was sold, in order to align it to the period over which the expense related to the OTC treatments is recognized. These grant monies were received in exchange for providing certain historical data to the CRAFT Foundation about the Company’s citrus groves. The $1,805 of CRAFT funds received in January of 2024 covered substantially all of the costs of the OTC application for 2023-2024 harvest and the $1,106 of CRAFT funds received in June 2024 will cover approximately 34% of the cost of OTC treatment for the 2024 - 2025 harvest. The Company may continue, but is not obligated, to participate in future CRAFT programs on the effects of the use of OTC on its Citrus Trees. \n\nConcentrations\n\nAccounts receivable from the Company’s major customer as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and revenue from such customer for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, are as follows:\n\n(in thousands)| Accounts Receivable| Revenue| % of Total Revenue  \n---|---|---|---  \nJune 30,| September 30,| Nine Months EndedJune 30,| Nine Months EndedJune 30,  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nTropicana| $| 3,218 | $| — | $| 40,456 | $| 32,220 | 88.5 | %| 82.3 | %  \n  \nThe citrus industry is subject to various factors over which growers have limited or no control, including weather conditions, disease, pestilence, water supply and market price fluctuations. Market prices are highly sensitive to aggregate domestic and foreign crop sizes, as well as factors including, but not limited to, weather and competition from foreign countries.\n\nThe overall increase in Tropicana revenue, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to an increase in processed fruit sales during the current quarter.\n\nSegments\n\nOperating segments are defined in the criteria established under ASC Topic 280 as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on two operating segments: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe Financial Statements include the accounts of Alico and the accounts of all the subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is held by the Company. Under U.S. GAAP, consolidation is generally required for investments of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of an investee, except when control is not held by the majority owner. The Company’s subsidiaries include: Alico Land Development, Inc., Alico-Agri, Ltd., Alico Plant World, LLC, Alico Fruit Company, LLC, Alico Citrus Nursery, LLC, Alico Chemical Sales, LLC, Alico Ranch, LLC, Alico Natural Resources, LLC, 734 Citrus Holdings 1, LLC and subsidiaries (“Silver Nip”), Alico Skink Mitigation, LLC and Citree Holdings 1, LLC \n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\n(“Citree”). The Company considers the criteria established under FASB ASC Topic 810, “Consolidations” in its consolidation process. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the accompanying Financial Statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and cash flows during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis. The estimates are based on current and expected economic conditions, historical experience, the experience and judgment of the Company’s management and various other specific assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable.\n\nNoncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Subsidiary\n\nThe Financial Statements include all assets and liabilities of the less-than-100%-owned subsidiary the Company controls, Citree. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a noncontrolling interest in the equity of such entity. Citree had net income of $276 and $490 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net losses of $1,190 and $286 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which 51% is attributable to the Company.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which amends Topic 280 primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2023-07 will become effective for us on October 1, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement on its Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which amends Topic 740 primarily through enhanced disclosures about an entity’s tax risks and tax planning. The amendments are effective for public business entities in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted on a prospective or retrospective basis. ASU 2023-09 will become effective for us on October 1, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement on its tax disclosures but it does not impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nNote 3. Inventories\n\nInventories consist of the following at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n\n(in thousands)| June 30,2024| September 30,2023  \n---|---|---  \nUnharvested fruit crop on the trees| $| 34,980 | $| 50,699  \nOther| 1,018 | 1,782  \nTotal inventories| $| 35,998 | $| 52,481  \n  \nThe Company records its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. \n\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company recorded $28,549 and $1,616, respectively, for adjustments to reduce inventory to net realizable value, within Operating expenses. The adjustment for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was due to significantly lower than anticipated harvests of the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia crops, as a result of the continued recovery from the impacts of Hurricane Ian. \n\nThe Company received $299 of insurance proceeds relating to Hurricane Ian during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as part of a final true-up of amounts due. In the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company received insurance proceeds relating to Hurricane Ian of approximately $16,643 and $21,403 for crop claims, which have been recorded in operating expenses. \n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nIn the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company received $0 and approximately $1,315 under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant (“CRBG”) program. These federal relief proceeds are included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nNote 4. Assets Held for Sale\n\nIn accordance with its strategy to dispose of non-core and under-performing assets, the following assets have been classified as assets held for sale at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\n\n(in thousands)| Carrying Value  \n---|---  \nJune 30,2024| September 30,2023  \nRanch| $| 69 | $| 1,632  \nAlico Citrus| 3,037 | —  \nTotal assets held for sale| $| 3,106 | $| 1,632  \n  \nOn April 19, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 798 acres of citrus land, which were not producing as expected, for $7,183 ($9,000 per acre). This agreement includes an option to purchase approximately 680 additional acres within 10 months of the closing date of the sale, at the same price per acre. The 798 acre sale closed on June 28, 2024.\n\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company consummated the sale of approximately 18,354 acres of land for $86,217 and recognized a gain of $81,246, including 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch to the State of Florida for $77,631 in gross proceeds. A portion of the proceeds from these sales was used to repay the outstanding balance on the Company’s working capital line of credit (“WCLC”) with Rabo Agrifinance, Inc. (“Rabo”), the $19,094 Met Life Variable-Rate Term Loans, plus accrued interest and for general corporate purposes. \n\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company sold approximately 888 acres to various third parties for $4,883 and recognized a gain of $4,689 (including approximately 85 acres to Mr. John E.

At June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $25,000 and $25,000 were available under the RLOC, respectively, and $69,752 and $45,030 was available under the WCLC, respectively.\n\nThe term loans and RLOC are secured by real property. The security for the term loans and RLOC consists of approximately 38,200 gross acres of citrus groves. The WCLC is collateralized by the Company’s current assets and certain other personal property owned by the Company.\n\nThe Met Fixed-Rate Term Loans, which bear interest at 3.85%, are interest-only with a balloon payment at maturity on November 1, 2029.\n\nThe Met Variable-Rate Term Loans are subject to quarterly principal payments of $406 and bear interest at the One Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus 175 basis points (the “SOFR spread”) with a maturity date of November 1, 2029. The SOFR spread was subject to adjustment by Met every 2 years beginning May 1, 2023, until maturity. As of November 1, 2023, the interest rate on the Met Variable-Rate Term Loans was 7.53% per annum, payable quarterly, until December 26, 2023, when Company repaid the outstanding balance of $19,094, plus accrued interest, on these loans and no further borrowings are possible on these loans. The interest rate on the Met Variable-Rate Term Loans was 7.52% per annum, payable quarterly, as of September 30, 2023. Effective February 17, 2023, the Company had agreed to defer the next three quarterly principal payments which were previously due May 2023, August 2023 and November 2023 to the maturity date of the loan. \n\nWith respect to the RLOC, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the SOFR-based spread was SOFR plus 220 basis points and was subject to adjustment by the lender every 2 years beginning May 1, 2023, until maturity on November 1, 2029. The RLOC is subject to an annual commitment fee of 25 basis points on the unused portion of the line of credit and is available for funding general corporate purposes. The variable interest rate was 7.53% per annum and 7.52% per annum as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nThe WCLC is a revolving credit facility and is available for funding working capital and general corporate requirements. The WCLC agreement was amended on October 27, 2022, and the primary terms of the amendment were an extension of the maturity to November 1, 2025, and the conversion of the interest rate from LIBOR plus a spread to SOFR plus a spread, which spread is adjusted quarterly, based on the Company’s debt service coverage ratio for the preceding quarter and can vary from 175 to 250 basis points. There were no changes to the commitment amount. The rate at September 30, 2023 was SOFR plus 175 basis points, or 7.08% and 7.07% per annum, respectively, as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The WCLC agreement provides for Rabo to issue up to $2,000 in letters of credit on the Company’s behalf, of which $248 and $248 were issued as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nThe WCLC is subject to a quarterly commitment fee on the daily unused availability under the line computed as the commitment amount less the aggregate of the outstanding loans and outstanding letters of credit. The commitment fee is adjusted quarterly based on The Company's debt service coverage ratio for the preceding quarter and can vary from a minimum of 20 basis points to a maximum of 30 basis points. Commitment fees were charged at 20 basis points; except from May 18, 2023 through August 8, 2023, when they were charged at 30 basis points. On June 5, 2024, the WCLC was amended to include, among other provisions, an allowance for certain dispositions that the Company may make, as defined in the agreement.\n\nThese credit facilities noted above are subject to various covenants including the following financial covenants: (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00; (ii) tangible net worth of at least $160,000 increased annually by 10% of consolidated net income for the preceding years, or $174,628 for the year ended September 30, 2023; (iii) minimum current ratio of 1.50 to 1.00; (iv) debt to total assets ratio not greater than .625 to 1.00, and; (v) solely in the case of the WCLC, a limit on capital expenditures of $30,000 per fiscal year. As of June 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants. \n\nCredit facilities also include a Met Life term loan collateralized by 1,200 gross acres of citrus grove owned by Citree (“Met Citree Loan”). This is a $5,000 credit facility that bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.28% per annum. Principal and interest \n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\npayments are made on a quarterly basis. Effective February 17, 2023, the Company agreed to defer the next three quarterly principal payments which were previously due May 2023, August 2023 and November 2023 to the maturity date of the loan. The loan matures in February 2029.\n\nSilver Nip Citrus Debt\n\nThere are two fixed-rate term loans, with an original combined balance of $27,550, which bear interest at 5.35% per annum (“Pru Loans A & B”). Principal of $290 is payable quarterly, together with accrued interest. The loans are collateralized by 5,700 acres of citrus groves in Collier, Hardee, Highlands and Polk Counties, Florida and mature on June 1, 2029 and June 1, 2033, respectively.\n\nThe Pru Loans A & B are subject to an annual financial covenant whereby the consolidated current ratio requirement is 1.00 to 1.00. Silver Nip Citrus was in compliance with the current ratio covenant as of June 30, 2024.\n\nDeferred Financing Costs\n\nCosts incurred to obtain financing are deferred and amortized to “Interest expense” in the condensed consolidated statement of operations over the related financing period using the effective interest method. The Company records debt issuance costs as a direct reduction of the carrying value of the related debt. Financing costs related to the undrawn RLOC are included in \"Other non-current assets\" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nNote 8. Income Taxes\n\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 was a (benefit) of 31.1% and a provision of 28.4%, respectively. The rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 differed from the Federal Statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to state income taxes and a change in the valuation allowance for the charitable contribution carryover.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 was a provision of 13.7% and 28.8%, respectively. The rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 differed from the Federal Statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to the valuation allowance booked for the charitable contribution carryover.\n\nNote 9. Segment Information\n\nSegments\n\nTotal revenues represent sales to unaffiliated customers, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goods and services produced by these segments are sold to wholesalers and processors in the United States, who prepare the products for consumption. The Company evaluates the segments’ performance based on direct margins (gross profit) from operations before general and administrative expenses, interest expense, other income (expense) and income taxes, not including nonrecurring gains and losses.\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nInformation by operating segment is as follows:\n\n(in thousands)| Three Months EndedJune 30,| Nine Months EndedJune 30,  \n---|---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nRevenues:  \nAlico Citrus| $| 13,237 | $| 6,712 | $| 44,591 | $| 37,917  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 373 | 572 | 1,117 | 1,249  \nTotal revenues| 13,610 | 7,284 | 45,708 | 39,166  \nOperating expenses:  \nAlico Citrus| 17,813 | (8,322)| 82,062 | 33,493  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 84 | 104 | 346 | 300  \nTotal operating expenses| 17,897 | (8,218)| 82,408 | 33,793  \nGross profit:  \nAlico Citrus| (4,576)| 15,034 | (37,471)| 4,424  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 289 | 468 | 771 | 949  \nTotal gross (loss) profit| $| (4,287)| $| 15,502 | $| (36,700)| $| 5,373  \nDepreciation, depletion and amortization:  \nAlico Citrus| $| 3,660 | $| 3,714 | $| 11,111 | $| 11,318  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 9 | 23 | 46 | 41  \nOther Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization| 46 | 101 | 160 | 326  \nTotal depreciation, depletion and amortization| $| 3,715 | $| 3,838 | $| 11,317 | $| 11,685  \n  \n(in thousands)| June 30,2024| September 30,2023  \n---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nAlico Citrus| $| 399,984 | $| 415,030  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 13,245 | 11,722  \nOther Corporate Assets| 1,373 | 1,601  \nTotal Assets| $| 414,602 | $| 428,353  \n  \n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nThe reconciliations of segment gross profit (loss) to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes are as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended June 30,| Nine Months Ended June 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nAlico Citrus| $| (4,576)| $| 15,034 | $| (37,471)| $| 4,424  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 289 | 468 | 771 | 949  \nSegment gross (loss) profit | (4,287)| 15,502 | (36,700)| 5,373  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 2,441 | 2,930 | 8,034 | 8,106  \n(Loss) income from operations| (6,728)| 12,572 | (44,734)| (2,733)  \nOther income (expense), net:  \nInterest income| 95 | — | 345 | —  \nInterest expense| (628)| (1,196)| (2,896)| (3,618)  \nGain on property and equipment| 4,491 | 2,605 | 81,520 | 7,368  \nOther income, net| — | 14 | — | 44  \nTotal other expense, net| 3,958 | 1,423 | 78,969 | 3,794  \n(Loss) income before income taxes| $| (2,770)| $| 13,995 | $| 34,235 | $| 1,061  \n  \nNote 10. Leases\n\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company’s leases consist of operating lease arrangements for certain office space, tractor leases and IT facilities. When these lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.\n\nAny lease arrangements with an initial term of one year or less are not recorded on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and it recognizes lease cost for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term. Many lease arrangements provide the options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement. The Company includes these options when it will be reasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Generally, lease agreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nAs most of our lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments.\n\nNo lease costs associated with finance leases and sale-leaseback transactions occurred and our lease income associated with lessor and sublease arrangements are not material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur operating leases cost components are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\n\n(in thousands)| Three Months Ended June 30,| Nine Months Ended June 30,  \n---|---|---  \nOperating lease components| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nOperating leases costs recorded in general and administrative expenses| $| 37 | $| 30 | $| 111 | $| 91  \n  \nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:\n\nJune 30, 2024  \n---  \nWeighted-average remaining lease term| 2.2 years  \nWeighted-average discount rate| 5.49 | %  \n  \n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nNote 11. Stock-based Compensation\n\nEffective January 27, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) which provides for up to 1,250 common shares available for issuance to provide a long-term incentive plan for officers, employees, directors and/or consultants to directly link incentives to stockholder value. The 2015 Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders in February 2015. The Company’s 2015 Plan provides for grants to eligible participants in various forms including restricted shares of the Company’s common stock and stock options. Awards are discretionary and are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Awards vest based upon service conditions. Non-vested restricted shares generally vest over requisite service periods of one to six years from the date of grant.\n\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for (i) Board of Directors fees (generally paid in treasury stock), and (ii) other awards under the 2015 Plan (paid in restricted stock and stock options). Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nStock Compensation – Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors can either elect to receive stock compensation or cash for their fees for services provided. Stock-based compensation expense relating to the Board of Directors fees was $118 and $375 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $137 and $450 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nRestricted Stock\n\nStock compensation expense related to the Restricted Stock was $57 and $169 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $61 and $253 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. There was $207 and $376 of total unrecognized stock compensation costs related to unvested stock compensation for the Restricted Stock grants at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nRestricted Stock Awards\n\nRestricted Stock Awards| Shares| Weighted-AverageGrant DateFair Value  \n---|---|---  \nOutstanding at September 30, 2023| 17,540| $| 37.82  \nVested| (35)| 32.30  \nForfeited| (5)| 32.30  \nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 (a)| 17,500| $| 37.82  \n  \na.The weighted average remaining contractual term is 1.3 years and the aggregate intrinsic value of RSAs expected to vest is $512.\n\nStock Option Grants\n\nNumber ofOptions| WeightedAverageExercisePrice| WeightedAverageRemainingContractualTerm(years)| AggregateIntrinsicValue  \n---|---|---|---  \nVested and outstanding - June 30, 2024| 38,000| $| 33.75 | 2.5| —  \n  \nStock compensation expense related to the options of $0 and $0 was recognized for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and $0 and $18 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. At June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were no unrecognized stock compensation costs related to unvested share-based compensation for the option grants.\n\nForfeitures of RSAs and stock options were recognized as incurred. \n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nTotal stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, which was recognized in general and administrative expense, was $175 and $544, respectively, and $198 and $731 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nNote 12. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nPurchase Commitments\n\nThe Company enters into contracts for the purchase of citrus trees during the normal course of its business. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $3,384 relating to outstanding commitments for these purchases that will be paid upon delivery of the remaining citrus trees.\n\nLetters of Credit\n\nThe Company had outstanding standby letters of credit in the total amount of $248 at both June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, to secure its various contractual obligations.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, Alico may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. There are no current legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any of its property is subject that it believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.\n\nNote 13. Related Party Transactions\n\nLease Agreement \n\nOn January 1, 2022, Mr. Kiernan, the Company’s President and CEO, entered into a Hunting Lease Agreement and Real Estate Purchase and Sale Option Agreement, with the Company (the “Kiernan Lease Agreement”). Under the Kiernan Lease Agreement, the Company leased approximately 93 acres of Company owned, largely unimproved land (the “Land”) to Mr. Kiernan for a three-year term commencing on January 1, 2022, and ending on January 1, 2025, with a yearly rent of $1,860 (in whole dollars). Additionally, under the terms of the Kiernan Lease Agreement, the Company granted to Mr. Kiernan an option to purchase the Land from the Company, exercisable only during the one-year period January 1, 2022, through January 1, 2023, and at a price of $480 ($5,161 per acre), which price is based on an independent appraisal obtained by the Company. On August 26, 2022, Mr. Kiernan exercised his option to purchase the land. Pursuant to the exercise of the option, the Company sold 85 acres to Mr. Kiernan on October 20, 2022 for $439 ($5,161 per acre).\n\nCapital Contribution \n\nOn June 10, 2024, all operating partners of Citree received a funding notice relating to an additional Cash Capital Contribution (“Contribution”) requirement of $750, as a result of trees producing limited revenue as they continue to recover from Hurricane Ian. The Company’s portion of the Contribution of $382 and the noncontrolling parties’ portion of $368 was funded on July 11, 2024. \n\nOn June 6, 2023, all operating partners of Citree received a funding notice relating to an additional Cash Capital Contribution requirement of $900, as a result of trees producing limited revenue due to the severity of the fruit drop resulting from Hurricane Ian. The Company’s portion of the Contribution was $460 and funded on June 22, 2023. The remaining portion of the Contribution of $440 was funded by the noncontrolling parties.\n\nNote 14. Subsequent Events\n\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after June 30, 2024, the balance sheet date, up to the date that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued and determined there are no additional events to disclose.\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nItem 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes theretoand other information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other filings with the SEC.Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those included our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other portions of this Quarterly Report. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. In the following discussion and analysis,dollars are in thousands, except per share and per acre amounts.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nBusiness Description\n\nAlico, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “Alico”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) generates operating revenues primarily from the sale of our citrus products, providing management services to citrus groves owned by third parties, and grazing and hunting leasing. We operate as two business segments, and all of our operating revenues are generated in the United States. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we generated operating revenue of $13,610 and $7,284, respectively, (loss) income from operations of $(6,728) and $12,572, respectively, and net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders of $(2,044) and $11,832, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $18,720 and $618 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nBusiness Segments\n\nOperating segments are defined in the criteria established under FASB ASC Topic 280 as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by our CODM in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. Our CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on its operating segments. \n\nOur two segments are as follows:\n\n•Alico Citrus includes activities related to planting, owning, cultivating and/or managing citrus groves to produce fruit for sale to fresh and processed citrus markets, including activities related to the purchase and resale of fruit and value-added services, which include contracting for the harvesting, marketing and hauling of citrus; and\n\n•Land Management and Other Operations includes activities related to grazing and hunting leasing, management and/or conservation of unimproved native pastureland and activities related to rock mining royalties and other insignificant lines of business. Also included are activities related to owning and/or leasing improved farmland. Improved farmland is acreage that has been converted, or is permitted to be converted, from native pasture and which may have various improvements including irrigation, drainage and roads.\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Alico Citrus segment generated 97.3% and 92.1%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues and the Land Management and Other Operations segment generated 2.7% and 7.9%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.\n\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Alico Citrus segment generated 97.6% and 96.8%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues and the Land Management and Other Operations segment generated 2.4% and 3.2%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nRecent Developments\n\nTropicana Orange Purchase Agreement\n\nOn June 5, 2024, we entered a new three-year Orange Purchase Agreement (the “Tropicana Agreement”) to sell oranges to Tropicana at prices that are approximately 33% to 50% higher, over the life of the contract, than the average price for all the citrus fruit sold to Tropicana last season. The Tropicana Agreement is effective June 5, 2024 through July 31, 2027, subject to its terms and conditions, and succeeds existing agreements with Tropicana that expired at the end of July 2024. \n\nCitrus Research and Field Trial Foundation\n\nIn June 2024, we received $1,106 from CRAFT of grower’s support payments in connection with our use of OTC, to combat the effect of “greening” in our citrus trees. \n\nLand Sale\n\nOn June 28, 2024, we sold 798 acres of citrus land for approximately $7,183 ($9,000 per acre).\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nCondensed Consolidated Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 2023:\n\n(in thousands)  \n---  \nThree Months Ended June 30,| Change| Nine Months Ended June 30,| Change  \n2024| 2023| $| %| 2024| 2023| $| %  \nOperating revenues:  \nAlico Citrus| $| 13,237 | $| 6,712 | $| 6,525 | 97.2 | %| $| 44,591 | $| 37,917 | $| 6,674 | 17.6 | %  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 373 | 572 | (199)| (34.8)| %| 1,117 | 1,249 | (132)| (10.6)| %  \nTotal operating revenues| 13,610 | 7,284 | 6,326 | 86.8 | %| 45,708 | 39,166 | 6,542 | 16.7 | %  \nGross (loss) profit:  \nAlico Citrus| (4,576)| 15,034 | (19,610)| (130.4)| %| (37,471)| 4,424 | (41,895)| (947.0)| %  \nLand Management and Other Operations| 289 | 468 | (179)| (38.2)| %| 771 | 949 | (178)| (18.8)| %  \nTotal gross (loss) profit| (4,287)| 15,502 | (19,789)| (127.7)| %| (36,700)| 5,373 | (42,073)| (783.0)| %  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 2,441 | 2,930 | (489)| (16.7)| %| 8,034 | 8,106 | (72)| (0.9 | %)  \n(Loss) income from operations| (6,728)| 12,572 | (19,300)| (153.5)| %| (44,734)| (2,733)| (42,001)| NM  \nTotal other expense, net| 3,958 | 1,423 | 2,535 | 178.1 | %| 78,969 | 3,794 | 75,175 | NM  \n(Loss) income before income taxes| (2,770)| 13,995 | (16,765)| (119.8)| %| 34,235 | 1,061 | 33,174 | NM  \nIncome tax (benefit) provision| (861)| 1,923 | (2,784)| (144.8 | %)| 9,721 | 306 | 9,415 | NM  \nNet (loss) income| (1,909)| 12,072 | (13,981)| (115.8)| %| 24,514 | 755 | 23,759 | NM  \nNet (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests| (135)| (240)| 105 | (43.8)| %| 583 | 140 | 443 | 316.4 | %  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Alico, Inc. common stockholders| $| (2,044)| $| 11,832 | $| (13,876)| (117.3)| %| $| 25,097 | $| 895 | $| 24,202 | NM  \n  \nNM = Not meaningful\n\nOperating Revenue\n\nThe 86.8% increase in revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to the timing of the Valencia harvest, which is discussed in further detail below. \n\nThe 16.7% increase in revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in pound solids produced as we began to recover to pre-hurricane levels and an increase in the price per pound solids for both the Early and Mid-season and Valencia crops, as a result of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana, which is discussed in further detail below. In addition, there was an increase \n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nin Grove Management Services revenue as a result of the Citrus Grove Management Agreement we entered into on October 30, 2023 (the “Grove Owners Agreement”) with an unaffiliated group of third parties (the “Grove Owners”) to provide citrus grove caretaking services for approximately 3,300 acres owned by such third parties for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nThe increase in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily driven by insurance proceeds of $16,643 and $21,403 for crop claims received during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 (the “Crop Insurance Proceeds”), which were recorded as a reduction of operating expenses. In addition, the increase in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 was impacted by a combination of the inventory adjustments recorded at September 30, 2022 on the ending inventory balance, as a result of the impact of Hurricane Ian, which effectively lowered the inventory to be expensed in fiscal year 2023, as well as a 103.1% and 15.1%increase in the number of boxes which needed to be harvested in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. See Note 3. Inventories to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $489 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee costs (as a result of lower bonus accruals), lower depreciation, lower legal costs (as a result of the voluntary dismissal of the shareholder lawsuit in the prior year), and lower accounting and insurance costs. \n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $72 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to lower depreciation, legal and insurance costs, partially offset by increased employee costs. \n\nOther Expense, net\n\nOther Expense, net for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $2,535, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by gains of $4,396 on the sale of 798 acres of citrus land during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to gains of $2,613 on the sale of 548 acres of the Alico Ranch during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. \n\nOther Expense, net for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased$75,175, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch to the State of Florida and the sale of 798 acres of citrus land during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. By comparison, for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 we recognized gains on sale of property and equipment of approximately $7,368 relating to the sale of 1,436 acres, in the aggregate, from the Alico Ranch to several third parties.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe decrease in the income tax (benefit) provision of $(2,784) for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was driven by a pre-tax loss for the current period, as opposed to pre-tax income in the three months ended June 30, 2023. \n\nThe increase in the income tax (benefit) provision of $9,415for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was principally due to the gain on the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch to the State of Florida in the current year, while the income tax provision for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was due to the lower pre-tax income generated for the period. \n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of our operating segments:\n\nAlico Citrus\n\n(in thousands, except per box and per pound solids data)  \n---  \nThree Months Ended June 30,| Change| Nine Months Ended June 30,| Change  \n2024| 2023| Unit| %| 2024| 2023| Unit| %  \nOperating Revenues:  \nEarly and Mid-Season| $| — | $| — | $| — | — | $| 14,534 | $| 11,954 | $| 2,580 | 21.6 | %  \nValencias| 12,183 | 6,064 | 6,119 | 100.9 | %| 26,915 | 23,994 | 2,921 | 12.2 | %  \nFresh Fruit and Other| 108 | 221 | (113)| (51.1)| %| 801 | 991 | (190)| (19.2)| %  \nGrove Management Services| 946 | 427 | 519 | 121.5 | %| 2,341 | 978 | 1,363 | 139.4 | %  \nTotal| $| 13,237 | $| 6,712 | $| 6,525 | 97.2 | %| $| 44,591 | $| 37,917 | $| 6,674 | 17.6 | %  \nBoxes Harvested:  \nEarly and Mid-Season| — | — | — | — | 1,194 | 979 | 215 | 22.0 | %  \nValencias| 843 | 415 | 428 | 103.1 | %| 1,855 | 1,669 | 186 | 11.1 | %  \nTotal Processed| 843 | 415 | 428 | 103.1 | %| 3,049 | 2,648 | 401 | 15.1 | %  \nFresh Fruit| — | 1 | (1)| (100.0)| %| 35 | 41 | (6)| (14.6)| %  \nTotal| 843 | 416 | 427 | 102.6 | %| 3,084 | 2,689 | 395 | 14.7 | %  \nPound Solids Produced:  \nEarly and Mid-Season| — | — | — | — | 5,364 | 4,586 | 778 | 17.0 | %  \nValencias| 4,294 | 2,142 | 2,152 | 100.5 | %| 9,365 | 8,702 | 663 | 7.6 | %  \nTotal| 4,294 | 2,142 | 2,152 | 100.5 | %| 14,729 | 13,288 | 1,441 | 10.8 | %  \nPound Solids per Box:  \nEarly and Mid-Season| —| —| —| — | 4.49| 4.68| (0.19)| (4.0)| %  \nValencias| 5.09| 5.16| (0.07)| (1.3)| %| 5.05| 5.21| (0.16)| (3.1)| %  \nPrice per Pound Solids:  \nEarly and Mid-Season| $| — | $| — | $| — | — | $| 2.71 | $| 2.61 | $| 0.10 | 3.8 | %  \nValencias| $| 2.84 | $| 2.83 | $| 0.01 | 0.3 | %| $| 2.87 | $| 2.76 | $| 0.11 | 4.1 | %  \nPrice per Box:  \nFresh Fruit| $| — | NM| $| — | — | $| 15.89 | $| 14.02 | $| 1.87 | 13.3 | %  \nOperating Expenses:  \nCost of Sales| $| 14,038 | $| 6,603 | $| 7,435 | 112.6 | %| $| 68,857 | $| 45,647 | $| 23,210 | 50.8 | %  \nHarvesting and Hauling| 3,296 | 2,047 | 1,249 | 61.0 | %| 11,843 | 10,573 | 1,270 | 12.0 | %  \nFresh Fruit and Other| (222)| (17,278)| 17,056 | (98.7)| %| (229)| (23,340)| 23,111 | (99.0)| %  \nGrove Management Services| 701 | 306 | 395 | 129.1 | %| 1,591 | 613 | 978 | 159.5 | %  \nTotal| $| 17,813 | $| (8,322)| $| 26,135 | (314.0)| %| $| 82,062 | $| 33,493 | $| 48,569 | 145.0 | %  \n  \n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nComponents of Results of Operations for Alico Citrus Segment\n\nWe sell our Early and Mid-Season and Valencia oranges to orange juice processors. The processors generally buy the citrus crop on a pound solids basis, which is the measure of the soluble solids (sugars and acids) contained in one box of fruit. Our Fresh Fruit revenue is derived from sales to packing houses that purchase the citrus on a per box basis. We also provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services to third parties from which revenues are recorded as Grove Management Services, including a management fee. Other revenues consist of the purchase and reselling of fruit.\n\nOperating expenses for our Alico Citrus segment consist primarily of Cost of Sales, Harvesting and Hauling costs and Grove Management Service costs. Cost of Sales represents the cost of maintaining the citrus groves for the preceding calendar year and does not vary in relation to production. Harvesting and Hauling costs represent the costs of bringing citrus product to processors and vary based upon the number of boxes produced. Grove Management Services costs include those costs associated with citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services provided to third parties. Other expenses include the period costs of third-party grove caretaking and the purchase and reselling of third-party fruit. \n\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 for the Alico Citrus Segment\n\nThe 97.2% increase in revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a 100.5% increase in pound solids, driven by a combination of factors related to the timing of the Valencia harvest, which started later this year to allow the fruit more time to mature, as compared to an acceleration of the harvest in the prior year as a result of Hurricane Ian, to try to mitigate the fruit drop. \n\nThe 17.6% increase in revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to an 10.8% increase in pound solids produced as the trees continue to recover from the effects of Hurricane Ian, an increase in the price per pound solids for both the Early and Mid-season and Valencia crops as a result of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana, and an increase in Grove Management Services revenue as a result of the signing of the Grove Owners Agreement. Although Hurricane Ian initially impacted the fiscal year 2023 harvest, we expect it may take another season, or more, for the groves to recover to pre-hurricane production levels. \n\nThe Early and Mid-Season harvest was completed in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024 the pound solids per box decreased4.0%, and the processed box production increased 22.0%, compared to the same nine month period in the prior year. Although the overall decrease in pound solids per box for the season was disappointing, the increase in total boxes produced demonstrates that the groves are beginning to recover from the effects of Hurricane Ian. In addition, there was an increase in the price per pound solids of 3.8% in the Early and Mid-Season fruit harvested for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana. \n\nThe Valencia harvest was completed for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and pound solids per box decreased 1.3%and 3.1%, respectively, and the processed box production increased 103.1% and 11.1%, respectively, compared to the same three and nine month periods in the prior year. In addition, there was an increase in the price per pound solids of 0.3%and 4.1% in the Valencia fruit harvested for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as a result of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana. \n\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized a decrease in revenue from sales of Fresh Fruit and Other of $113 and $190, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by a decrease in the amount of fruit that was resold on behalf of grove owners. \n\nRevenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 from the grove owners relating to Grove Management Services increased 121.5% and 139.4%, respectively, compared to the prior year, principally due to the signing of the Grove Owners Agreement in October 2023. \n\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized an increase in Cost of Sales of $7,435 and $23,210, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, which was driven by a combination of the inventory adjustments recorded at September 30, 2022 on the ending inventory balance as a result of the impact of Hurricane Ian, which effectively lowered the inventory to be expensed in fiscal year 2023, as well as a 103.1% and 15.1%increase in \n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nboxes harvested in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.\n\nFor the three month period ended June 30, 2024, Harvest and Hauling expenses increased $1,249, compared to the prior year period, driven by the increase in the number of boxes produced for the period as a result of the timing of our harvest. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024, Harvesting and Hauling expenses were up $1,270, when compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by the increase in the number of boxes produced for the period as we continue to recover from the impact of Hurricane Ian. \n\nFor the three and nine month periods ended June 30, 2024, the credit amounts shown in “Fresh Fruit and Other” in operating expenses above primarily represent a final true-up of Crop Insurance Proceeds from Hurricane Ian, received in the current period. For the three and nine month periods ended June 30, 2023, the credit amounts primarily represent the Crop Insurance Proceeds of $16,643 and $21,403, respectively, which were recorded as a reduction of operating expenses, and includes $1,315 in federal relief proceeds received under the CRBG program in the nine months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThere was a 129.1% and 159.5% increase in operating expenses relating to grove management services for the Grove Owners for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the new Grove Owners Agreement.\n\nLand Management and Other Operations\n\nThe table below presents key operating measures for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 for the Land Management and Other Operations segment:\n\n(in thousands)| Three Months Ended June 30,| Change| Nine Months Ended June 30,| Change  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n2024| 2023| $| %| 2024| 2023| $| %  \nRevenue From:  \nLand and Other Leasing| $| 302 | $| 474 | $| (172)| (36.3)| %| $| 894 | $| 1,028 | $| (134)| (13.0)| %  \nOther| 71 | 98 | (27)| (27.6)| %| 223 | 221 | 2 | 0.9 | %  \nTotal| $| 373 | $| 572 | $| (199)| (34.8)| %| $| 1,117 | $| 1,249 | $| (132)| (10.6)| %  \nOperating Expenses:  \nLand and Other Leasing| $| 84 | $| 104 | $| (20)| (19.2)| %| $| 341 | $| 295 | $| 46 | 15.6 | %  \nOther| — | — | — | — | 5 | 5 | — | —   \nTotal| $| 84 | $| 104 | $| (20)| (19.2)| %| $| 346 | $| 300 | $| 46 | 15.3 | %  \n  \nComponents of Results of Operations for Land Management and Other Operations Segment\n\nLand and Other Leasing includes lease income from leases for grazing rights, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction rights to third parties, and other miscellaneous income.\n\nLand and Other Leasing operating expenses includes real estate, property taxes, general and administrative expenses including salaries, benefits and legal.\n\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 for the Land Management and Other Operations Segment\n\nLand Management and Other Operations revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 decreased 34.8% and 10.6%, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year principally due to a decrease in hunting lease revenue as a result of the sale of the ranch land. \n\nThe decrease in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in property taxes related to land sales. The increase in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the nine months ended \n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nJune 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in mining permitting costs, offset by a decrease in property taxes related to land sales.\n\nSeasonality\n\nWe are primarily engaged in the production of fruit for sale to citrus markets, which is of a seasonal nature, and subject to the influence of natural phenomena and wide price fluctuations. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year produce most of our annual revenue. However, due to the timing of the current year harvest, more of the citrus crop was harvested in the first and second quarters of this fiscal year. Working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, coinciding with harvesting cycles. Because of the seasonality of the business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nA comparative balance sheet summary is presented in the following table:\n\n(in thousands)| June 30,2024| September 30,2023| Change  \n---|---|---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 9,106 | $| 1,062 | $| 8,044   \nTotal current assets| $| 54,364 | $| 58,805 | $| (4,441)  \nTotal current liabilities| $| 20,358 | $| 15,065 | $| 5,293   \nWorking capital| $| 34,006 | $| 43,740 | $| (9,734)  \nTotal assets| $| 414,602 | $| 428,353 | $| (13,751)  \nPrincipal amount of term loans and lines of credit| $| 84,510 | $| 129,319 | $| (44,809)  \nWorking capital ratio|  2.67 to 1|  3.90 to 1  \nDebt to total assets ratio| 0.20 to 1| 0.30 to 1  \n  \nSources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\n\nOur business has historically generated full fiscal year positive net cash flows from operating activities, although the net cash flow in the first quarter of each fiscal year has been negative because of seasonality and the associated need to expend cash in advance of generating revenues from the harvesting season. Sources of cash primarily include cash flows from operations, sales of under-performing land and other assets, amounts available under our credit facilities, and access to capital markets. Access to additional borrowings under revolving lines of credit is subject to the satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions. As a public company, we may have access to other sources of capital. However, access to, and availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including (i) financial condition, prospects, and credit rating; (ii) liquidity of the overall capital markets; and (iii) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms, or at all.\n\nThe principal uses of cash that affect our liquidity position include the following: operating expenses including employee costs, the cost of maintaining the citrus groves, harvesting and hauling of citrus products, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, dividends, debt service costs including interest and principal payments on term loans and other credit facilities and acquisitions. Although the current year tax provision is recorded within Income taxes payable on our balance sheet, as required by U.S. GAAP; we do not expect to pay any further income taxes for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The income tax payable is expected to be reclassified to Deferred income tax liabilities, net, at year-end, as we anticipate utilizing a portion of our prior year net operating loss carryover.\n\nManagement believes that a combination of cash-on-hand, cash generated from operations, and asset sales and availability under our lines of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to service the principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and will satisfy working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and over the long term. However, this is subject, to a certain extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nBorrowing Facilities and Long-term Debt\n\nWe have a $70,000 working capital line of credit and a $25,000 revolving line of credit, of which $69,752 and $25,000 was available for general use as of June 30, 2024 (see Note 7. Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We may utilize the available cash to pay down indebtedness, pursue citrus grove acquisitions, conduct share repurchases, and possibly reinstate increased dividends. If we choose to pursue significant growth and other corporate opportunities, these actions could have a material adverse impact on our cash balances and may require us to finance such activities by drawing down on our lines of credit or by obtaining additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Any inability to obtain additional financing could adversely impact our ability to pursue different growth and other corporate opportunities.\n\nThe level of debt could have important consequences on our business, including, but not limited to, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting the availability of cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements, and limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and industry.\n\nOur credit facilities are subject to various debt covenants including the following financial covenants: (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00; (ii) tangible net worth of at least $160,000 increased annually by 10% of consolidated net income for the preceding years, or $174,628 applicable for the year ended September 30, 2023; (iii) minimum current ratio of 1.50 to 1.00; (iv) debt to total assets ratio not greater than 0.625 to 1.00; and (v) solely in the case of the WCLC, a limit on capital expenditures of $30,000 per fiscal year. As of June 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants.\n\nCash Flows\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased from $1,592 as of June 30, 2023, to $9,106 as of June 30, 2024. The components of these changes are discussed below.\n\n(in thousands)| Nine Months Ended June 30,| Change  \n---|---|---  \n2024| 2023  \nNet cash (used in) operating activities| $| (18,720)| $| (618)| $| (18,102)  \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities| 70,088 | (5,718)| 75,806   \nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities| (45,954)| 7,063 | (53,017)  \nNet increase in cash and restricted cash| $| 5,414 | $| 727 | $| 4,687   \n  \nNet Cash (Used In) Operating Activities\n\nThe $(18,102) increase in Net Cash (used in) operating activities was driven by Crop Insurance Proceeds of $21,403 during the nine months ended June 30, 2023, partially offset by increased revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. \n\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\n\nThe $75,806 increase in Net Cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch and the 798 acres of citrus land.\n\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities\n\nThe increase of $(53,017) in Net Cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to the repayment of the WCLC and the $19,094 Met Life Variable-Rate Term debt with the proceeds from the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch, as compared to an increase in net borrowings under the WCLC in the same period in the prior year.\n\nWe had $0 and $17,910 outstanding on our revolving lines of credit as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nThe WCLC agreement provides for Rabo Agrifinance, Inc. to issue up to $2,000 in letters of credit on our behalf. As of June 30, 2024, there was $248 in outstanding letters of credit, which correspondingly reduced our availability under the WCLC.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations are described in the accompanying notes to the financial statements within [Part I, Item 1](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_13) of this Quarterly Report. These include principal and interest payments on long-term debt as described in Note 7. Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, operating leases as described in Note 10. Leases and purchase commitments as described in Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience, available current market information and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, the Company evaluates the results of these estimates on an on-going basis. Management’s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nSee Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates from those reflected in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate Risk - We are subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments such as term loan debt and other borrowings. Our primary long-term obligations are fixed rate debts subject to fair value risk due to interest rate fluctuations. See Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe are also subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt; however, at June 30, 2024, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding.\n\nIn the three months ended June 30, 2024, there were no other material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from those discussed in Part II, Item 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 6, 2023.\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nLimitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nManagement, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024 there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#i0db9b71ba19a480186bba32a82809439_7)\n\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, we have been, and may in the future be involved in, litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.

We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe\nharbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements, including without\nlimitation, statements regarding future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products, trends, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales\nefforts, expenses, interest rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans relating to dividends, government regulations, the adequacy of our liquidity to\nmeet our needs for the foreseeable future and our expectations regarding market conditions. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other\nimportant factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or\nimplied by the forward-looking statements.\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates”,\n“estimates”, “projects,” “intends,” “plans” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Annual Report are only\npredictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report and are subject to a number\nof important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described under the sections in this\nAnnual Report titled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nYou should read this Annual Report and the documents that we reference in this Annual Report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be\nmaterially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan\nto publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.\nAs used in this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Alico” refer to the operations\nof Alico, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nSUMMARY RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. You should carefully consider\nthese risks and uncertainties, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, when investing in our common stock. The principal risks and\nuncertainties affecting our business include the following:\n• Adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change and hurricanes and tropical storms, particularly\nbecause our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida, could impose significant costs and losses on our business and adversely affect our results of\noperations, financial position and cash flows.\n• Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including, but not limited to, citrus greening and citrus canker, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n• A significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business.\n• Our failure to effectively perform grove management services, or to effectively manage an expanded portfolio of groves, could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\n• We depend on our relationship with Tropicana and Tropicana’s relationship with certain third parties for a significant portion of our business. Any disruption in these\nrelationships could harm our revenue. Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction\nin revenues and cash flows.\n• If we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our\nbusiness, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\n• We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.\n• Our agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.\n• Changes in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops.\n• Harm to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such\ntransactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.\n• We may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results\nof operations, or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.\n• Our citrus business is seasonal.\n• Our earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.\n• Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\n• ESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows and damage our reputation.\n• Increases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.\n• Increases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs, could adversely affect our operating results.\n• We are subject to transportation risks.\n• We benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land. Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by\ncounty property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities.\n• Liability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.\n• Compliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business, which could reduce our profits.\n• Our business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.\n• Material weaknesses and other control deficiencies relating to our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading price of our securities.\n• Macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation, the deadly conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, and the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n• System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and\nany such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\n• We maintain a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and may limit our\noperational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.\n• We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.\n• Some of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.\n• We may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.\n3\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOverview\nAlico was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in 1960. Alico is an agribusiness with a legacy of achievement and innovation in citrus and conservation. We own\napproximately 72,000 acres of land in eight Florida counties (Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands and Polk), and also mineral rights throughout\nFlorida. We hold these mineral rights on substantially all our owned acres, with additional mineral rights on other leased acres. Our principal lines of business are citrus groves\nand land management.\nWe are one of the largest citrus producers in the United States of America.\nWe operate two divisions: Alico Citrus, a citrus producer on its own land and as a manager of citrus groves for third parties, and Land Management and Other Operations,\nwhich includes land conservation, encompassing environmental services, land leasing and related support operations.\nWe manage our land based upon its primary usage and review its performance based upon two primary classifications - Alico Citrus and Land Management and Other\nOperations. The Alico Citrus division includes the production, cultivation and sale of citrus on our owned lands and as a manager of citrus groves for third parties. Land\nManagement and Other Operations include leases for grazing rights, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction rights to\nthird parties, and other miscellaneous operations generating income. We present our financial results and the related discussion based upon our two business segments: (i) Alico\nCitrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations.\nRecent Developments\nFlorida Forever Program Land Sale\nOn September 18, 2023, we signed an Option Agreement for Sale and Purchase (“Option Agreement”) with the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund of\nthe State of Florida for the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch. On September 21, 2023, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet approved the purchase of\nthis land from Alico, under the Florida Forever Program, for approximately $77,600 thousand. The sale is expected to close between December 2023 and February 2024, and\nwe intend to use the proceeds from this sale to repay variable rate debt and for general corporate purposes.\nHurricane Ian\nOn September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian made landfall on the southwest coast of Florida and a majority of our groves were adversely impacted by the storm. The impact of\nHurricane Ian has affected our year ended September 30, 2023 fruit production as we accelerated the harvest to maximize box production for both our Early and Mid-Season\nand Valencia harvest, which was completed earlier than the prior year harvest. Approximately 48,900 gross acres of our citrus groves, which are in Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto,\nHardee, Hendry, Highlands and Polk Counties, sustained hurricane or tropical storm force winds for varying durations of time. While we lost a small percentage of trees, the\nforce and duration of the storm impacted the majority of the groves. Based upon prior experience with serious storms of this nature, we expect it may take up to two full seasons\nor more for the groves to recover to pre-hurricane production levels.\nWe maintain crop insurance and property and casualty insurance and have received, as of September 30, 2023, $27,389 thousand in proceeds for crop claims and $839 thousand\nrelating to property and casualty damage claims. These insurance proceeds are included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFederal Relief Program – Hurricane Ian\nIn December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law by the federal government; however, the details of the mechanism and funding of any Hurricane\nIan relief still remains unclear and, if available, the extent to which we will be eligible. We intend to take advantage of any such available programs as and when they become\navailable. We are currently working with Florida Citrus Mutual, the industry trade group, and government agencies on the federal relief programs available as part of the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act.\nCitrus Greening Treatment\nIn 2022, we began testing a new application of the citrus greening therapy Oxytetracycline (“OTC”), which is used in citrus and other crops. Although not a cure for citrus\ngreening, this OTC application is expected to mitigate some of the impacts of citrus greening and is expected to decrease the rate of fruit drop and improve fruit quality. After a\nreview of the new application method by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (“FDACS”) granted a\nspecial local-need registration (24c) on October 28, 2022. We began treating our trees on\n4\nTable of Contents\nJanuary 16, 2023, as the product and application devices became available, and as of September 30, 2023, had treated over 35% of our trees. The extent of any benefit of the\nOTC application will not be measurable until the completion of the harvest for the year ended September 30, 2024.\nSales of Land\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, we sold approximately 2,255 acres to third parties for approximately $12,000 thousand and recognized a gain of $11,432 thousand.\nFederal Relief Program – Hurricane Irma\nWe were eligible for Hurricane Irma federal relief programs for block grants that were being administered through the State of Florida. We have received a total of $26,963\nthousand in Hurricane Irma federal relief through the year ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we have received all funds due under the Florida Citrus\nRecovery Block Grant (“CRBG”) program. These federal relief proceeds are included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During\nthe years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 we received Hurricane Irma federal relief proceeds of $1,315 thousand, $1,123 thousand and $4,299 thousand, respectively.\nThe Land We Manage\nWe regularly review our land-holdings to determine the best use of each parcel based upon our management expertise. Our total return profile is a combination of operating\nincome potential and long-term appreciation. Land holdings not meeting our total return criteria are considered surplus to our operations and efforts are being made to sell such\nland holdings or to exchange such land holdings for land considered to be more compatible with our business objectives and total return profile, or to lease such land holdings.\nOur land holdings and the operating activities in which we engage are categorized in the following table:\nGross Acreage Operating Activities\nAlico Citrus\nCitrus Groves 48,927 Citrus Cultivation\nCitrus Nursery 22 Citrus Tree Development\n48,949\nLand Management and Other Operations\nRanch 22,328 Leasing and Conservation\nOther Land 526 Mining Lease and Office\n22,854\nTotal 71,803\nAlico Citrus\nWe own and manage citrus land in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties in the state of Florida and engage in the cultivation of citrus trees\nto produce citrus for delivery to the fresh and processed citrus markets. Alico citrus groves total 48,949 gross acres or 68.2% of our land holdings.\nCitrus Land Lease\nOn June 29, 2022, we signed three agreements to lease approximately 2,100 citrus acres from the grove owners and thus had the rights to citrus production on such leased\nacreage for a one-year term at a cost of $157 thousand. On June 26, 2023, we extended the lease representing approximately 1,115 acres for one-year through June 30, 2024.\nAdditionally, on the same terms and conditions, we have the right to extend this lease representing 1,115 acres for two one-year periods. This lease expands our current citrus\nproduction acreage by approximately 3%, over our owned land production, to approximately 36,000 net citrus acres.\n5\nTable of Contents\nOur citrus acreage is further detailed in the following table:\nNet Plantable\nTotal Net Support\nProducing Developing Fallow Plantable & Other Gross\nDeSoto County 17,569 — — 17,569 4,043 21,612\nPolk County 4,907 — — 4,907 2,147 7,054\nCollier County 3,869 — — 3,869 3,187 7,056\nHendry County 5,758 — 311 6,069 2,831 8,900\nCharlotte County 976 — 136 1,112 1,409 2,521\nHighlands County 1,049 — — 1,049 175 1,224\nHardee County 410 — — 410 172 582\nTotal 34,538 — 447 34,985 13,964 48,949\nOf the 48,949 gross acres of citrus land we own and manage, 13,964 acres are classified as support and other acreage. Support and other acreage include acres used for roads,\nbarns, water detention, water retention and drainage ditches integral to the cultivation of citrus trees, but which are not capable of directly producing fruit. In addition, we own a\nsmall citrus tree nursery consisting of approximately 22 acres and utilize the trees produced in this nursery in our own operations. The 34,985 remaining acres are classified as\nnet plantable acres. Net plantable acres are those that are capable of directly producing fruit. These include acres that are currently producing, acres that are developing (i.e.,\nacres that are planted with trees too young to commercially produce fruit) and acres that are fallow.\nIn an effort to increase the density of our citrus groves, we have planted approximately 2,200,000 new trees since 2017. This level of planting has been substantially higher than\nthe normal level of tree attrition. We will continue to evaluate the density throughout our groves and determine the appropriate tree plantings moving forward. Typically, citrus\ntrees become fruit-bearing four to five years after planting and peak around seven to eight years after planting.\nOur Alico Citrus business segment cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. Our sales to the processed market were 94.0%,\n84.5%, and 82.7% of Alico Citrus revenues for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The overall increase in the sales to the processed markets as a\npercentage of citrus revenues during the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, is due to the termination of an\nagreement to provide grove management services to third-party grove owners, discussed further below.\nThe average pound solids per box was 5.02, 5.28, and 5.66 for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe generally use multi-year contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a floor and ceiling price. Therefore, if pricing in the market is favorable,\nrelative to our floor price, we benefit from the incremental difference between the floor and the final market price to the extent it does not exceed the ceiling price.\nOur citrus produced for the processed citrus market during the year ended September 30, 2023, under our largest agreement, was subject to floor prices and ceiling prices.\nUnder this agreement, if the market price was below the floor prices or exceeded the ceiling prices, then 50% of the shortfall or excess was deducted from the floor price or\nadded to the ceiling price. Under our next largest agreement, our citrus produced is subject to a minimum floor price and maximum ceiling price and is based on a cost-plus\nstructure.\nIn May, 2020, we entered into two agreements to supply Tropicana, our largest customer, with citrus fruit. These new agreements were effective October 1, 2020, expire on July\n31, 2024, and succeeded our existing largest agreement with this customer which expired at the end of September 2020. On June 26, 2023 we renewed another agreement to\nsupply Tropicana with citrus fruit, which expired after the fiscal year 2023 harvest season. This new agreement was effective August 31, 2023 and expires on August 31, 2025.\nOur sales to the fresh citrus market constituted 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.6% of our Alico Citrus revenues for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn June 2022, a group of third-party grove owners, who are affiliated with each other (collectively, the “Grove Owners”), for which we were managing groves under a Property\nManagement Agreement executed on July 16, 2020 with the Grove Owners, under which we performed grove management services, terminated the management relationship\nunder the Property Management Agreement with us as the Grove Owners decided to exit the citrus business. As a result, all grove management services relating to the Property\nManagement Agreement and the accompanying management fee and reimbursed costs associated with performing grove management services ceased on June 10, 2022. The\nmanagement fee was paid through June 30, 2022. We continue to provide grove management services to several small third-party grove-\n6\nTable of Contents\nowners on acres within our groves. Revenues generated from our grove management services were 3.2%, 13.3%, and 16.1% of our total citrus revenues for the years ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOn October 30, 2020, we purchased approximately 3,280 gross acres located in Hendry County for a purchase price of $18,230 thousand. This acquisition allowed us to add\nadditional scale to our then approximately 46,000 gross acres of citrus properties. Strategically, with these acquired groves neighboring existing Alico groves, we believe that\nthis acquisition will help us with our operation designed to be a low-cost, high-producing citrus grower.\nRevenues from our Alico Citrus operations were 95.7%, 97.5%, and 97.5% of our total operating revenues for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nLand Management and Other Operations\nWe own and manage land in Collier, Glades, and Hendry Counties and lease land for recreational and grazing purposes, conservation, and mining activities. Our Land\nManagement and Other Operations land holdings total 22,854 gross acres, or 31.8% of our total acreage.\nOur Land Management and Other Operations acreage is detailed in the following table as of September 30, 2023:\nAcreage\nHendry County 18,722\nCollier County 3,606\nGlades County 526\nTotal 22,854\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, we sold approximately 2,255 acres for $12,000 thousand and recognized a gain of $11,432 thousand (including approximately 85\nacres for $439 thousand to Mr. John E. Kiernan, our President and CEO).\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we sold approximately 9,414 acres for $41,421 thousand and recognized a gain of $39,124 thousand.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, we sold approximately 17,434 acres for $26,664 thousand and recognized a gain of $25,272 thousand (including approximately\n7,372 acres for $20,120 thousand to the State of Florida, under the Florida Forever program, for a gain of $5,570 thousand). See Note 4. Assets Held for Sale to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further information on ranch land sales.\nRevenues from Land Management and Other Operations were 4.3%, 2.5%, and 2.5% of total operating revenues for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nOur Strategy\nOur core business strategy is to maximize stockholder value through continuously improving the return on our invested capital, either by holding and managing our existing\nland through skilled agricultural production, leasing, or other opportunistic means of monetization, disposing of under productive land or business units and acquiring new land\nor operations with appreciation potential.\nOur objectives are to produce the highest quality agricultural products, create innovative land uses, opportunistically acquire and convert undervalued assets, sell under-\nproductive land and other assets not meeting our total return profile, generate recurring and sustainable profit with the appropriate balance of risk and reward, and exceed the\nexpectations of stockholder, customers, clients and partners.\nOur strategy is based on what we believe are best-management practices of our agricultural operations and the environmental and conservation stewardship of our land and\nnatural resources. We try to manage our land in a sustainable manner to maximize value creation and to evaluate the effect of changing land uses while considering new\nopportunities. We believe that our commitment to environmental stewardship is fundamental to our core beliefs.\nIntellectual Property\nWhile we consider our various intellectual property to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be\nmaterially impacted by any single piece of intellectual property or group of related intellectual property registrations or rights.\n7\nTable of Contents\nSeasonal Nature of Business\nAs with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations and revenues are predominantly seasonal in nature. The following table illustrates the seasonality of our\nagribusiness revenues:\nYear Ended September 30\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4\nEnding 12/31 Ending 3/31 Ending 6/30 Ending 9/30\nOct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept\nHarvest Fresh and Early/Mid Varieties of\nOranges X X X X\nHarvest Valencia Oranges X X X X\nSignificant Customer\nRevenue from Tropicana represented 81.3%, 79.7%, and 77.5% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue in\nthe years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, from Tropicana, was generated primarily from two separate contracts. This revenue was generated from the sale of our citrus\nproduct in the processed market. No other single customer provided more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nThe slight increase in Tropicana revenue, as a percentage of sales, for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 is primarily due to the Grove Owners terminating the\nProperty Management Agreement in June 2022.\nCompetition\nThe orange and specialty citrus markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the\nproduction of most agricultural commodities. Citrus is grown domestically in several states including Florida, California, Arizona, and Texas, as well as foreign countries, most\nnotably Brazil and Mexico. Competition is impacted by several factors including quality, production, demand, brand recognition, market prices, weather, disease, export/import\nrestrictions and foreign currency exchange rates.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)\nWe are an agricultural company which, based upon its rich heritage and traditions, seeks to maximize value for its customers and stockholders in the long term, which we\nbelieve includes employing sustainable practices in all aspects of operations including stewardship of both its natural and human resources. We recognize the increased\nemphasis by stockholders, business partners and other key constituents in recent years on ESG programs that are embedded into day-to-day business policies and practices. We\nare proud of our focus on the impacts of our business on our communities, the environment, and employees.\nGovernmental Regulations\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes we are in material\ncompliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material impact on our\nfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nManagement monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every reasonable effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. In addition, we require in\nour leases that lessees of our property comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing.\nWe are subject to other laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies within the United States, which may differ among jurisdictions.\nCompliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive\nposition as compared to prior periods.\nHuman Capital Management\nPurpose and Company Values\nSupporting our people is a fundamental value for Alico. We believe our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and\nindustry knowledge of our employees and the employees of our\n8\nTable of Contents\nindependent contractors significantly benefit our operations and performance. Our management oversees various employee initiatives and also monitors the effectiveness of the\npersonnel provided by independent contractors with which we contract for certain harvesting and hauling services.\nEmployees\nWe believe in a culture of equity, diversity and inclusion. We are also committed to advancing safe and respectful work environments where our employees are invited to bring\ntheir talents, backgrounds and expertise to bear on the success of our business and where every person has the opportunity to thrive personally and professionally.\nHiring, Development and Retention\nEmployee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and consider the services that are provided for us by our independent contractors. We rely on our independent\ncontractors to manage their respective employee levels so that the harvesting and hauling services they are obligated to perform for us are consistent with the contractual\nobligations of these independent contractors and enable us to satisfy our harvesting and hauling needs. Management believes that through our own employees, coupled with the\nhuman capital supplied by our independent contractors, we have sufficient human capital to operate our business successfully. Management believes that our employee relations\nare favorable, that our relations with our independent contractors is favorable, and that the relations that the independent contractors and we have with the employees of the\nindependent contractors is favorable.\nEmployee Safety and Well-Being\nProtecting the health and safety in the workplace for our employees and personnel provided by independent contractors with which we contract is one of our core values.\nHazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. In order to support and enhance\nhealth and safety practices, we routinely conduct safety training with employees to emphasize safety when conducting grove caretaking, general employee health, proper\nequipment operating techniques, office ergonomics and other important safety topics. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees\nand the personnel provided by independent contractors safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention to protect our workforce so that our workforce can more safely and effectively perform their work.\nInclusion and Diversity\nPeople are critical to our efforts to drive growth and deliver value for stockholders. One of the ways we have put people at the center is by continuing to work toward a more\ninclusive and diverse workplace where each person feels respected, valued and seen and can be the best version of themselves – from women and ethnically diverse employees\nto veterans, among others. With employees, management and directors from diverse backgrounds, we can access stronger insights into different cultures and backgrounds,\nwhich ultimately helps us to better operate the business.\nBased on our Inclusion and Diversity strategy, we seek to promote a greater sense of inclusion through a variety of initiatives, which includes a Company-wide women’s group\nto promote mentoring, career advancement, training, comradery, and empowerment.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our employees. We are committed to equal pay for equal work,\nregardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or other personal characteristics. We believe our base wages and salaries, which we review annually, are fair and competitive with the\nexternal labor markets in which our employees work. We also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay. We also offer competitive benefit\nprograms, in line with local practices and with the flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce. The benefit programs include, among others, paid holidays,\nfamily leave, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare, and a 401(k) plan with a company match. As of September 30, 2023, we had 194 full-time employees and no part-\ntime employees. We do not include our independent contractors in our number of employees because they are not employees.\n9\nTable of Contents\nOur employees work in the following divisions:\nAlico Citrus 168\nLand Management and Other Operations (1) 0\nCorporate, General, Administrative and Other 26\nTotal employees 194\n(1) There is one employee who is included in Corporate, General, Administrative and Other who oversees the Land Management and Other Operations.\nNone of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.\nWorkforce Housing\nWe own and maintain 38 residential housing units located in various counties in Florida that we offer to employees. Our residential units provide affordable housing to many of\nour employees, including our agribusiness employees. Employees live close to their work, which reduces traffic and commuting times. This unique employment benefit helps us\nmaintain a dependable, long-term employee base.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials needed to cultivate the various crops grown by us consist primarily of fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides and fuel and are readily available from local suppliers.\nThese raw materials are purchased on an order basis without long-term commitments. Our key suppliers for fertilizer, herbicides and insecticides include Howard Fertilizer,\nWedgeworth’s, Nutrien AG Solutions and Helena Agri-Enterprises.\nSocietal Well-Being\nWe remain committed to a healthy and equitable society to ensure our collective well-being for future generations. In the past year, we provided cash grants and supporting\ndonations to support our communities and promote health, safety and education.\nAvailable Information\nOur reports filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available, free of charge, on our investor relations website at\nir.alicoinc.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Any\ninformation posted on, or that can be accessed through our website, is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. The SEC also maintains a website at\nhttp://www.sec.gov, which contains annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with\nthe SEC.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of key known\nfactors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. They should be considered carefully, together with the\ninformation set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, and with our other filings with the SEC. The realization of any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material\nadverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects, as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives.\nRisks Related to our Business\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change and hurricanes and tropical storms, particularly\nbecause our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida, could impose significant costs and losses on our business and adversely affect our results of\noperations, financial position and cash flows.\nFresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with\nhigher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme\ncases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past,\nincluding the freeze in the last week of January 2022. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or\nkilled. These factors can\n10\nTable of Contents\nincrease costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition\nand cash flows.\nOur citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida, with our groves located in parcels in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee\nCounties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial\nposition and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm\nmakes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus\nproduction through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could\nmaterially affect our citrus operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. For instance, recent Hurricane Ian had a\nmaterial adverse effect on the fruit production from our trees for the 2023 harvest season and, potentially to a lesser extent, the next season and future seasons. We seek to\nminimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but a significant portion of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the\noccurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes (such as the freeze in the last week of January 2022), unusually heavy\nor prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or properties.\nOur citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including, but not limited to, citrus greening and citrus canker, which could negatively impac tour business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus\ngroves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves.\nCitrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to\nhumans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions\nof citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as\nfresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a\nresult of citrus greening, orange production in the state of Florida has continued to drop.\nCitrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known\ncure for citrus canker at present, although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected\ntrees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.\nBoth of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we try to use best management practices to attempt to control\ndiseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs, which could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues. A\nsignificant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business.\nOur revenues from our citrus business were 95.7%, 97.5%, and 97.5% of our operating revenues in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our citrus\ndivision is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States, and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are vulnerable to adverse\nevents or market conditions affecting our citrus business, in particular, or the citrus business, generally, which could have a significant adversely impact on our overall results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure to effectively perform grove management services, or to effectively manage an expanded portfolio of groves, could materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively perform grove management services for both our own groves and the groves owned by third parties at the level and/or the cost that we expect, or\nif we were to fail to allocate sufficient resources to meet the grove management of our own groves and the groves owned by these third parties, it could adversely affect our\nperformance and reputation. Our ability to perform the grove management services has in the past and will continue to be affected by various factors, including, among other\nthings, our ability to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel, the ability of the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in providing these services to\nmaintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel, and the number of acres and groves that we will manage. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into our organization or that the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in\nproviding these services will continue to be\n11\nTable of Contents\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into their respective organizations.\nOur business is highly competitive, and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share.\nMany companies compete in our different businesses and offer products that are similar to our products or are direct competitors to our products. We face strong competition\nfrom these and other companies engaged in the agricultural product business.\nImportant factors with respect to our competitors include the following:\n• Some of our competitors may have greater operating flexibility and, in certain cases, this may permit them to respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry.\n• We cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or whether those actions will have a negative effect on us.\n• Our competitors may have access to substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and agricultural resources, regional, national or global areas that offer\nagricultural advantages, and enhanced public visibility or reputations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our present and future competitors, and our ability to compete could be materially adversely\naffected by our debt levels and debt service requirements.\nWe depend on our relationship with Tropicana and Tropicana’s relationship with certain third parties for a significant portion of our business. Any disruption in these\nrelationships could harm our revenue. Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction\nin revenues and cash flows.\nOur contracts with Tropicana accounted for 81.3%, 79.7%, and 77.5% of our revenues in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The revenue for\nTropicana is primarily generated from two contracts. Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to\nfind replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer\nor significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, with the sale of a majority ownership of Tropicana by PepsiCo to a French private equity firm (the “Firm”), there is some heightened risk and uncertainty in our\ncurrent relationship with Tropicana, which potentially could result in a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows if that relationship were to be changed. We currently\nhave citrus supply contracts with Tropicana that expire in both 2024 and 2025, with the majority expiring in 2024. If Tropicana were to reduce the volume of oranges purchased\nfrom us and/or purchased from owners of groves that we manage, we would need to find, and/or the owners of groves that we manage would need to find or work with us to\nfind, replacement buyers to purchase any remaining crop of our and/or of the owners of the groves we manage, which could take time and expense and may result in less\nfavorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana for us and/or for the owners of the groves we manage may cause\na material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.\nAgricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues, with citrus being the largest portion and subject to supply and demand pricing. Prior to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, according to Nielsen data, consumer demand for orange juice had decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade; however, we have been\nable to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. In addition, there is currently a shortage of orange juice worldwide that\nis forecasted to continue for the foreseeable future. Although the demand for orange juice has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain as to whether such\nincreased demand can be maintained, whether we will see a return to a decline in the future and whether, if there were to be such a decline, the impact could be again offset by\nhigher prices. Although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some\ninstances, the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive\nsupplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic\nmarket conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our\nbusiness, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the\nlong term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new\nstrategies. These\n12\nTable of Contents\nstrategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result, and depending\non evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more\nof such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic\ninitiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues. In addition, we may incur higher than\nexpected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There can be no assurance that\nthe implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.\nThe sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties,\nproduct contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling\nor transportation phases. We are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in\nthe future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative\npublicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and\nbrand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered or fully covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have\nagainst others. We cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our product liability insurance coverage.\nOur agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.\nOur operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water\nmanagement districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for\nthe use of underground and surface water which are believed to be adequate for our agricultural needs.\nSurface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to\nirrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water, even though the use of water\nhas been permitted by the State of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake\nOkeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of\nsurface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows.\nChanges in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops.\nWe engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S.\nimmigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement has been attracting significant attention from the U.S. Government, with enforcement operations taking place across the\ncountry, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. It remains unclear how the U.S. administration and U.S. Congress will approach immigration reform and\nenforcement. If new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. and/or if enforcement actions are taken against available personnel, such legislation and/or enforcement\nactivities may contain provisions that could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who might be found\nto be unauthorized workers, or the scarcity of other available personnel to harvest our agricultural products, could cause harvesting costs to increase, or could lead to the loss of\nproduct that is not timely harvested, which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHarm to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining a strong reputation with fruit processors and third-party partners is critical to the success of our business. We devote significant time and resources to training\nprograms, relating to, among other things, ethics, compliance and product safety and quality, as well as sustainability goals, and have published ESG goals (i.e., environmental,\nsocial and governance), including relating to environmental impact and sustainability and inclusion and diversity, as part of our ESG strategy. Despite these efforts, we may not\nbe successful in achieving our goals, might provide materially inaccurate information, or might receive negative publicity about the Company, including relating to product\nsafety, quality, efficacy, ESG or similar issues, whether real or perceived, and reputational damage could occur. In addition, our products could face withdrawal, recall or other\nquality issues, which could lead to decreased demand for our products or services and reputational damage.\n13\nTable of Contents\nWidespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. Negative publicity, posts\nor comments about the Company, whether accurate or inaccurate, or disclosure of non-public sensitive information about the Company, could be widely disseminated through\nthe use of social media or in other formats.\nIf a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such\ntransactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.\nFrom time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges under the federal income tax law. It is possible that the\nqualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest\nand penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional income taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available.\nMoreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult, or not\npossible, for us to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.\nWe may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results\nof operations, or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.\nWe continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such\nacquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests.\nThe consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a\ncontribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the\nbenefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.\nThese transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams,\nincreased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including\naccelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of\nthe risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other\nstrategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the\nnumber of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.\nWe seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, (i) in the year ended September\n30, 2015, we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in\nthe United States; and (ii) in October 2020 we acquired another Florida citrus property. We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could\nreduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain\nany financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially\ndilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and\ndiversion of management’s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to\nsuccessfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets, which could include the exit from lines of business. For example, in November of 2014, we sold\nsignificant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business and, in January of 2018, we sold our breeding herd and no longer engage in cattle\noperations. Most recently, we sold certain ranch acres to the State of Florida, and because these acres would have been critically important for carrying out our planned\ndispersed water storage project, we are no longer pursuing permit approval relating to this dispersed water storage project. Such dispositions could (i) result in a potential loss of\nsignificant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, (ii) make our business less diversified, and (iii) ultimately have a negative impact on\nour results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur citrus business is seasonal.\nOur citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the\nsecond and third quarters of our year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth\nquarters of our year, coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may\nbe achieved for the full year or in future quarters. If our operating revenues in\n14\nTable of Contents\nthe second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.\nWe face significant competition in our agricultural operations.\nWe face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have\nan equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation, and, in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have\ngreater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The\ncompetition we face from certain foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally-imposed tariff on orange imports. Accordingly, a reduction in the\ngovernment’s orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.\nExcess supplies often cause severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms,\nfloods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product.\nFresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. Many of the items involved in our business, such as oranges, must be\nsold more quickly than other produce our competitors may produce, such as lemons. As such, our competitors may be able to maintain certain items they produce in inventory\nfor longer periods than we are able to maintain our inventory, which may offer our competitors strategic advantages when they respond to fluctuations in market supply and\ndemand that are not available to us.\nIn addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our\nproducts. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to\ndevelop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products. If excess supplies do exist, this could result in reduced pricing or\nunusable inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the\nfrequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have\nan adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and\nregulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or climate change. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant\nincreases in our costs of operations, including, but not limited to, increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures. In particular, increasing regulation\nof fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, the SEC’s proposed climate-related disclosure rules, if adopted, would require new climate-related disclosures in SEC\nfilings, including certain climate-related metrics and greenhouse gas emissions data, information about climate-related targets and goals, transition plans, if any, and attestation\nrequirements. If adopted, these rules would impose increased compliance costs and could lead to increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rules,\neither of which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows and damage our reputation.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing and evolving scrutiny relating to their ESG policies, initiatives and disclosures from governments, regulators, investors,\nconsumers, employees and other stakeholders. Increased and varied focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital\ninvestment as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices, or due to our focus on ESG practices at all. In particular, certain customers, investors and other stakeholders are\nincreasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, and other sustainability concerns. There have also been\nchanging consumer preferences for natural or organic products and ingredients and increased consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the\neffects of substances present in certain consumer products. Responding to and complying with these preferences, concerns and demands could cause us to incur additional costs\nor to make changes to our operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the increased emphasis on ESG matters has resulted in, and may continue to result in, the adoption of laws and regulations, including reporting requirements, which\nincreased regulation will likely lead to increased compliance costs, as well as increased scrutiny regarding our ESG activities and disclosures, which may lead to increased\nlitigation risks. Moreover, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary\ndisclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be\n15\nTable of Contents\nrepresentative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are\nnecessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying,\nmeasuring and reporting on many ESG matters. Such disclosures may also be at least partially reliant on third-party information that we have not independently verified or\ncannot be independently verified. If we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations or fail to meet our ESG goals, or meet the evolving investor, industry or stakeholder\nexpectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, fruit processors and consumers may choose to\nstop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\nmay be adversely affected.\nIncreases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe primarily utilize labor contractors to harvest and deliver our fruit to outside packing facilities. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and\nother industries. Shortages of labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the United States, and in Florida in particular, could delay our harvesting or\norange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.\nWe and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and\nregulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.\nIncreases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs, could adversely affect our operating results.\nMany factors may affect the cost and supply of citrus, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, tariffs,\nagricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for products, as we have experienced in this last year, can negatively\nimpact our operating results and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.\nWe are subject to transportation risks.\nWe depend on third party providers of transportation and have no control over such third parties. An extended interruption in our ability to harvest and haul our products could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any extended disruption in the distribution of our products could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, we\ncannot be sure that our insurance would adequately cover all claims and that any efforts to transport our products by alternative means would be successful and done in a timely\nand cost-effective manner.\nWe benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land. Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by\ncounty property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we paid $2,786 thousand, $2,679 thousand, and $2,570 thousand in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were\nbased upon the agricultural use (“Green Belt”) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of $90,481 thousand, $85,159 thousand, and\n$82,790 thousand for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property\nappraisers of $419,915 thousand, $391,049 thousand, and $467,948 thousand, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural\nclassification or calculation of “Green Belt” values or average millage rates could significantly and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial\nposition.\nLiability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.\nOur agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable\nand have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be\nadequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay\nsignificant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business, which could reduce our profits.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies.\nWe face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our\n16\nTable of Contents\nownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from\nany of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of\nthese hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and other\nfactors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and work to remain in compliance\nwith such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for\nenvironmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices\nand terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land,\nmake it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments\nin which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any\nof our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.\nMaterial weaknesses and other control deficiencies relating to our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading price of our securities.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the\ncircumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of\nfinancial statements. Management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 concluded that our internal control over financial\nreporting was not effective and that a material weakness existed. This material weakness resulted in the restatements of our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements\nof changes in equity and related disclosures as of September 30, 2021, and as of the end of each quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021,\nJune 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 to correct errors relating to the calculation of deferred tax liabilities and make adjustments to the amounts of previously\nreported deferred tax liabilities and retained earnings. Although this material weakness was remediated, there can be no assurance that we will not identify additional material\nweaknesses in the future.\nIn future periods, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience\ndifficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which in turn could affect\nthe market price of our securities. In addition, perceptions of us among customers, lenders, investors, securities analysts and others could also be adversely affected. Any\nweaknesses or deficiencies identified in the future could also hurt confidence in our business and the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, and adversely affect\nour ability to do business with these groups. We can give no assurances that our controls and procedures will be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair\nand accurate presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nAny restatements and resulting investigations, legal or administrative proceedings could result in fines, injunctions, orders, and penalties which could materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nAs discussed above, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting resulted in the restatements of our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements\nof changes in equity and related disclosures as of September 30, 2021, and as of the end of each quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021,\nJune 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. This restatement and any future restatements, and any investigations, legal or administrative proceedings that could\nresult therefrom, may divert our management’s time and attention and cause us to incur substantial costs. Such investigations can also lead to fines or injunctions or orders with\nrespect to future activities. At this point, we are unable to predict whether the SEC or any other regulatory agencies will commence any investigations or commence legal action\nin connection with the restatements discussed above. Any such investigations may result in us being subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which\ncould have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nInflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nInflation can have a major adverse impact on our citrus operations and there have been significant ongoing inflationary developments in the United States. It is uncertain as to\nwhether these ongoing inflationary pressures will continue, will increase or will be brought under control. Our citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and\nunpredictable revenues and high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect\n17\nTable of Contents\nearnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, in addition to making it difficult to\naccurately predict revenue, we are unable to pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices. As a\nresult, if market conditions and commodity prices do not enable us to pass along such cost increases, these recent and future inflationary pressures would likely negatively affect\nour results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.\nMacroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation, the deadly conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, and the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, we continued to experience inflationary pressure on transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue through 2024.\nA number of external factors, including the deadly conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, as well as responses to such events including sanctions or other restrictive actions, by the\nUnited States and/or other countries, the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, increases in fuel prices, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages)\nand labor shortages have impacted, and may continue to impact, transportation and commodity costs and create significant macroeconomic uncertainty. When prices increase,\nwe may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. The extent to which current\nmacroeconomic conditions will continue to impact our results will depend on future developments, which are uncertain. Potential negative impacts of these uncertain conditions\ncould include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• Reduction in customer demand for citrus products and decreased consumer spending levels, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;\n• Potential disruption of services and deliveries of equipment and supplies on which we rely to produce and deliver our harvested citrus to producers and fulfilling\ndeliveries to production plants, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation;\n• We may be unable to obtain financing in the current economic environment on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, or at all, which could impair our cash flows\nand restrict our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives and react to changes in our business or the environment;\n• There could be increased volatility in our stock price, which could result in the loss of some or all of the value of an investment in the Company; and\n• Our ability to maintain our workforce during these uncertain times, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.\nAs a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, require us to adopt corporate\ngovernance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These laws, rules and regulations may continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could\nadversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and\nany such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nComputer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties,\ncreate system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software\nprograms that attack our systems and databases or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems and databases. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating\nsystem software and applications that we develop internally or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems\nthat could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious\nsoftware programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays,\ncessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.\nPortions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration\nor migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions\nand be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other\noperational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\n18\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and may limit our operational\nand financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had $129,319 thousand in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities, and an additional availability of\n$70,030 thousand is available under our working capital and revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, as well as other debt instruments we may enter into in the future,\nmay have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs, which\nwill reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nOur loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants, and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and\ntests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a\ndefault and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements\nalso contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide\nfunds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur. We intend to\nuse a portion of the proceeds from the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch, expected to close between December 2023 and February 2024, to repay variable rate debt.\nFollowing completion of this sale, we will have sold substantially all of the Alico Ranch, which is under-productive land. Land available for sale in the future to raise additional\nfunds consists primarily of productive land, the disposition of which may negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. In addition, there are factors beyond our control\nthat could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various\nfinancial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.\nTo service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful\nfinancial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various\nfinancial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n• Economic and competitive conditions;\n• Changes in laws and regulations;\n• Operating difficulties, increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience; and\n• Delays in implementing any strategic projects.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or\noperations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. If we are required to take any actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure investors that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that\nthese actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.\nSome of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.\nOur credit facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. Currently, we are\nexperiencing, and are expecting to continue to experience, increases in interest on our variable rate term loans. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will\nincrease faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants\ncontained in our credit facility and term loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile or decline, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you initially paid for our common\nstock.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this\n”Risk Factors” section and included elsewhere in this document may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n19\nTable of Contents\n• the occurrence of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes;\n• our operating and financial performance, quarterly or annual earnings relative to similar companies;\n• publication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by\nsecurities analysts;\n• the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans or commercial relationships;\n• any major change in our board of directors or senior management;\n• additional sales of our common stock by us, our directors, executive officers, or principal shareholders;\n• adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n• short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our common stock;\n• exposure to capital market risks related to changes in interest rates, realized investment losses, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and performance of\ninsurance- linked investments;\n• our creditworthiness, financial condition, performance, and prospects;\n• our dividend policy and whether dividends on our common stock have been, and are likely to be, declared and paid from time to time;\n• any repurchases by us of any of our outstanding shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan;\n• perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n• regulatory or legal developments;\n• changes in general market, economic, and political conditions;\n• terrorism and/or instability, unrest and wars, such as the conflicts involving Ukraine and Russia or Israel and its surrounding regions, and other international conflicts;\n• conditions or trends in our industry, geographies or customers;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n• threatened or actual litigation or government investigations.\nWe may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.\nWe have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock and in December 2022 announced a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.05 per\ncommon share, from $0.50 per common share. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our\nfinancial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of\nDirectors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future or have sufficient cash surplus or net\nprofits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors’ current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate,\nand that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our\nBoard of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends, or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash\ndividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n20\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1, “Business”, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and the accompanying Consolidated Financial\nStatements and related Notes thereto included in this Annual Report commencing on page 42. Our actual results of operations may differ materially from those discussed in\nforward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and other portions of this Annual\nReport. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to 2021, has been reported previously and\nmay be found under Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on December 13, 2022.\nBusiness Overview\nBusiness Description\nAlico, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “Alico”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) generates operating revenues primarily from the sale of our citrus\nproducts, providing management services to citrus groves owned by third parties, and grazing and hunting leasing. We operate as two business segments, and all of our\noperating revenues are generated in the United States. For the year ended September 30, 2023, we generated operating revenues of $39,846 thousand, loss from operations of\n$4,197 thousand, and net income attributable to common stockholders of $1,835 thousand. Net cash used in operating activities was $6,254 thousand for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. See Part I, Item 1, Business, included in this Annual Report for a discussion of our year highlights.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company has two segments as follows:\n• Alico Citrus includes activities related to planting, owning, cultivating and/or managing citrus groves to produce fruit for sale to fresh and processed citrus markets,\nincluding activities related to the purchase and resale of fruit and value-added services, which include contracting for the harvesting, marketing and hauling of citrus; and\n• Land Management and Other Operations includes activities related to native plant sales, grazing and hunting leasing, management and/or conservation of unimproved\nnative pastureland and activities related to rock mining royalties and other insignificant lines of business. Also included are activities related to owning and/or leasing\nimproved farmland. Improved farmland is acreage that has been converted, or is permitted to be converted, from native pasture and which may have various\nimprovements including irrigation, drainage and roads.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, the Alico Citrus segment generated 95.7% of our consolidated revenues and the Land Management and Other Operations segment\ngenerated 4.3% of our consolidated revenues.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following discussion presented below provides an analysis of our results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 2022, and the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, as compared to 2021.\n23\nTable of Contents\n(in thousands) Years Ended Years Ended\nSeptember 30, Change September 30, Change\n2023 2022 $ % 2022 2021 $ %\nOperating revenues:\nAlico Citrus $ 38,145 $ 89,681 $ (51,536) (57.5)% $ 89,681 $ 105,796 $ (16,115) (15.2)%\nLand Management and Other Operations 1,701 2,266 (565) (24.9)% 2,266 2,768 (502) (18.1)%\nTotal operating revenues 39,846 91,947 (52,101) (56.7)% 91,947 108,564 (16,617) (15.3)%\nGross profit (loss):\nAlico Citrus 5,186 (16,511) 21,697 (131.4)% (16,511) 21,903 (38,414) NM\nLand Management and Other Operations 1,260 1,746 (486) (27.8)% 1,746 1,990 (244) (12.3)%\nTotal gross profit (loss) 6,446 (14,765) 21,211 (143.7)% (14,765) 23,893 (38,658) NM\nGeneral and administrative expenses 10,643 10,079 564 5.6 % 10,079 9,453 626 6.6 %\n(Loss) income from operations (4,197) (24,844) 20,647 (83.1)% (24,844) 14,440 (39,284) NM\nTotal other income, net 6,656 37,799 (31,143) (82.4)% 37,799 31,947 5,852 18.3 %\nIncome before income taxes 2,459 12,955 (10,496) (81.0)% 12,955 46,387 (33,432) (72.1)%\nIncome tax provision 801 1,069 (268) (25.1)% 1,069 11,567 (10,498) (90.8)%\nNet income 1,658 11,886 (10,228) (86.1)% 11,886 34,820 (22,934) (65.9)%\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 177 573 (396) (69.1)% 573 39 534 NM\nNet income attributable to Alico, Inc. common\nstockholders $ 1,835 $ 12,459 $ (10,624) (85.3)% $ 12,459 $ 34,859 $ (22,400) (64.3)%\nNM -

Not Meaningful\nComponents of Results of Operations for Alico Citrus Segment\nOur citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus grove business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and harvest season.\nHistorically, the second and third quarters of our year produce the majority of the annual revenues and working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth\nquarters of our year, coinciding with the growing cycles.\nWe sell our Early and Mid-Season and Valencia oranges to processors that convert the majority of the citrus crop into orange juice. The processors generally buy the citrus crop\non a pound solids basis, which is the measure of the soluble solids (sugars and acids) contained in one box of fruit. Our fresh fruit is generally sold to packing houses that\npurchase\n25\nTable of Contents\ncitrus on a per box basis. We also provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services to third parties from which revenues are generated, including a\nmanagement fee. Other revenues consist of the purchase and reselling of fruit.\nOur operating expenses consist primarily of cost of sales, harvesting and hauling costs and grove management service costs. Cost of sales represents the cost of maintaining the\ncitrus groves for the preceding calendar year and does not vary in relation to production. Harvesting and hauling costs represent the costs of bringing citrus product to processors\nand vary, based upon the number of boxes produced. Grove management services include those costs associated with citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management\nservices provided to third parties. Other expenses include the period costs of reselling third-party fruit.\nComparison of the year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 for the Alico Citrus Segment\nThe decrease in revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, was primarily due to an increase in fruit drop caused by the\nimpact of Hurricane Ian, which in turn reduced our harvest of both the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia fruit. In addition, we had a decrease in Grove Management Services\nrevenues, from $11,928 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2022, to $1,234 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2023, due to the termination of the Property\nManagement Agreement (see “The Land We Manage” in Item 1. Business for further details). We recorded approximately $751 thousand and $10,547 thousand of operating\nexpenses relating to grove management services for the Grove Owners for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe decrease in Early and Mid-Season and Valencia fruit harvested was primarily driven by a decrease in processed box production and a decrease in pound solids per box. The\nprocessed box production for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased by 51.4%, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to greater fruit drop\nattributed to disease and weather conditions.\nThe aggregate decrease in pound solids per box of 5.8% during the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the prior year ended September 30, 2022, was mainly due to\nthe internal quality of the fruit not being as strong as it had been in the previous year. This decrease in pound solids per box was also due in part to an acceleration of the\nharvesting of the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia crops to maximize the box production and avoid additional fruit drop as a result of the impact of Hurricane Ian.\nPartially offsetting the decrease in processed box production and pound solids per box for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to the year ended September 30, 2022,\nwas an increase in the price per pound solid of 2.6%. The increase, in large part, was due to production being down in Florida, as well as in Brazil, and due to the continued\nstrong consumption of Not from Concentrate Orange Juice (“NFC”), both of which have led to continued low inventory levels.\nWe also recorded a decrease in revenue from sales of Fresh Fruit. The decrease in sales of Fresh Fruit was primarily due to a decrease in both boxes sold and pricing per box.\nThe USDA, in its October 12, 2023 Citrus Crop Forecast Report for the 2023-24 harvest season, indicated the overall Florida orange crop decreased from approximately\n41,200,000 boxes for the 2021-22 crop year to approximately 15,800,000 boxes for the 2022-23 crop year, a decrease of 61.7%. We experienced a decline in total box\nproduction in the 2022-2023 harvest season crop of 51.5%. We believe this lower rate of decline, as compared to the state forecast, is due to the efficiencies of our\ncomprehensive grove management program, as well as certain precautionary measures we took to minimize the impact of the freeze event on its groves and production.\nThe decrease in operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily relates to the inventory adjustments\nrecorded at September 30, 2022 on the ending inventory balance, as a result of the impact of Hurricane Ian, which effectively lowered the inventory to be expensed in the year\nended September 30, 2023, as well as the receipt of approximately $27,389 thousand in crop insurance and $839 thousand in property and casualty reimbursements for\nHurricane Ian. We experienced significant cost increases in fertilizer, herbicide, labor and fuel in maintaining our groves. These cost increases, coupled with the timing of the\nharvest, and the lower box production for both our Early and Mid-Season and Valencia harvest, resulted in a higher cost of sales per box for the year ended September 30, 2023,\nas compared to the same period in the prior year. In addition, we incurred additional costs related to the clean-up and repairs as a result of Hurricane Ian.\nWe also recorded an increase in our Harvesting and Hauling expense per box, which is directly related to an increase in the harvesting labor costs, as well as the increased time\nspent by the harvesters to fill the boxes as a result of the increased fruit drop caused by Hurricane Ian for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year.\nThe decrease in Grove Management Services expense is directly related to the termination of the Property Management Agreement by the Grove Owners in June 2022. We\nrecorded approximately $751 thousand and $10,547 thousand of operating expenses relating to grove management services for the Grove Owners for the years ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe credit amounts shown in “Fresh Fruit and other” in operating expenses above primarily represent insurance proceeds of approximately $27,389 thousand in crop insurance\nand $839 thousand in property and casualty reimbursements for Hurricane Ian received in the year ended September 30, 2023, and federal relief proceeds received under the\nCRBG program in the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 of approximately $1,315 thousand and $1,123 thousand, respectively.\nLand Management and Other Operations\nThe table below presents key operating measures for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(in thousands)\nYears Ended Years Ended\nSeptember 30, Change September 30, Change\n2023 2022 $ % 2022 2021 $ %\nRevenue From:\nLand and Other Leasing $ 1,327 $ 1,655 $ (328) (19.8)% $ 1,655 $ 2,404 $ (749) (31.2)%\nOther 374 611 (237) (38.8)% 611 364 247 67.9 %\nTotal $ 1,701 $ 2,266 $ (565) (24.9)% $ 2,266 $ 2,768 $ (502) (18.1)%\nOperating Expenses:\nLand and Other Leasing $ 436 $ 516 $ (80) (15.5)% $ 516 $ 762 $ (246) (32.3)%\nOther 5 4 1 25.0 % 4 16 (12) (75.0)%\nTotal $ 441 $ 520 $ (79) (15.2)% $ 520 $ 778 $ (258) (33.2)%\nComponents of Results of Operations for Land Management and Other Operations Segment\nLand and other leasing include lease income from leases for grazing rights, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction\nrights to third parties, and other miscellaneous income.\nLand and Other Leasing operating expenses include real estate, property taxes, and general and administrative expenses, including salaries, benefits and legal and professional\nfees.\nComparison of the year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 for the Land Management and Other Operations Segment\nThe decrease in revenues from Land Management and Other Operations for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to a decrease\nin grazing and hunting lease revenue due to the sales of portions of the Alico Ranch, which resulted in the reduction of land covered under our grazing and hunting lease\ncontracts. Additionally, the modification to the grazing leases resulted in a reduction in the ad valorem taxes due from the lessees, as we revised the grazing lease agreements\ndue to the sale of certain of the ranch acres previously covered under the agreement.\nThe decrease in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to\nthe reduction of the ad valorem tax expense as a result of us owning fewer ranch acres due to the sale of ranch land.\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operation, as a whole:\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $10,643 thousand, compared to $10,079 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2022. The\nincrease was principally attributable to an increase in legal and professional fees, as compared to the same period last year.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net, for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $6,656 thousand and $37,799 thousand, respectively. The decrease in other income, net was primarily\ndue to less ranch land sales, which resulted in lower gains on sales of $11,509 thousand during the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to $41,102 thousand for the prior\nyear period.\n27\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the provision for income taxes was $801 thousand and $1,069 thousand, respectively, and the related effective income tax\nrates were 32.6% and 8.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2023 is higher than the statutory tax rate due to the deferred rate change and\nreturn-to-provision adjustments, which was partially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2022 was lower\nthan the statutory tax rate due to the bargain sale of 1,638 acres of land to the state of Florida at a price below market value, which resulted in a charitable contribution carryover\nfor tax purposes. The bargain sale generated a tax benefit of $6,300 thousand, of which $500 thousand was utilized in the prior year, none of which was used in the current year.\nWe do not anticipate that we will be able to recognize the entire charitable deduction carryover before it expires in 2027. A valuation allowance of $4,309 thousand was\nrecorded on September 30, 2022, resulting in a net benefit of $1,468 thousand. As of September 30, 2023 the valuation allowance was reduced to $4,170 thousand, resulting in a\nbenefit of $139 thousand.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA comparative balance sheet summary is presented in the following table:\n(in thousands) September 30, September 30,\n2023 2022 Change\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,062 $ 865 $ 197\nTotal current assets $ 58,805 $ 31,616 $ 27,189\nTotal current liabilities $ 15,065 $ 16,525 $ (1,460)\nWorking capital $ 43,740 $ 15,091 $ 28,649\nTotal assets $ 428,353 $ 409,255 $ 19,098\nPrincipal amount of term loans and lines of credit $ 129,319 $ 111,624 $ 17,695\nCurrent ratio 3.90 to 1 1.91 to 1\nDebt ratio 0.30 to 1 0.27 to 1\nSources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\nOur business has historically generated positive net cash flows from operating activities. Sources of cash primarily include cash flows from operations, sales of under-\nperforming land and other assets, amounts available under our credit facilities and access to capital markets. Access to additional borrowings under revolving lines of credit is\nsubject to the satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions. As a public company, we may have access to other sources of capital. However, access to, and availability of,\nfinancing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including (i) financial condition, prospects, and credit rating; (ii) liquidity of the overall capital\nmarkets; and (iii) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe principal uses of cash that affect our liquidity position include the following: operating expenses including employee costs, the cost of maintaining the citrus groves,\nharvesting and hauling of citrus products, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, dividends, debt service costs including interest and principal payments on term loans and\nother credit facilities and acquisitions.\nManagement believes that a combination of cash-on-hand, cash generated from operations, asset sales (see “Recent Developments” inI tem 1. Business for further details) and\navailability under our lines of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to service the principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and will satisfy working capital\nrequirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and over the long term.\nBorrowing Facilities and Long-term Debt\nWe have a $70,000 thousand working capital line of credit, of which $45,030 thousand is available for general use as of September 30, 2023, and a $25,000 thousand revolving\nline of credit, all of which is available for general use as of September 30, 2023 (see Note 6. Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report for further information). The working capital line of credit agreement was amended on October 27, 2022, and the primary terms of the\namendment were an extension of the maturity to November 1, 2025, and the conversion of the interest rate from LIBOR plus a spread to SOFR plus a spread, which is adjusted\nquarterly, based on our debt service coverage ratio for the preceding quarter and can vary from 175 to 250 basis points, effective October 1, 2022. There were no changes to the\ncommitment amount.\nThe level of debt could have important consequences on our business, including, but not limited to, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry\nconditions, limiting the availability of cash flow to fund future\n28\nTable of Contents\ninvestments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements, and limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in\nour business and industry.\nOur credit facilities are subject to various debt covenants, including the following financial covenants: (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00; (ii) tangible net\nworth of at least $160,000 thousand increased annually by 10% of consolidated net income for the preceding years, or $174,628 thousand applicable for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023; (iii) minimum current ratio of 1.50 to 1.00; (iv) debt to total assets ratio not greater than 0.625 to 1.00; and (v) solely in the case of the WCLC (as defined\nbelow), a limit on capital expenditures of $30,000 thousand per year. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table details the items contributing to the changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(in thousands) Years Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (6,254) $ 6,523 $ 16,504\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities (4,123) 22,468 (3,268)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 13,204 (29,012) (32,037)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 2,827 $ (21) $ (18,801)\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Operating Activities\nThe decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, was primarily due to lower\nrevenues as a result of the fruit drop caused by Hurricane Ian.\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Investing Activities\nThe shift to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023, from net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022,\nwas driven by lower proceeds from ranch land sales.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities\nThe shift to net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023, from net cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022,\nwas primarily due to a net increase in borrowing under the working capital line of credit (“WCLC”) with Rabo Agrifinance, Inc. (“Rabo”), and lower repayments of term loans.\nThe WCLC agreement provides for Rabo to issue up to $2,000 thousand in letters of credit on our behalf. As of September 30, 2023, there was $248 thousand in outstanding\nletters of credit, which correspondingly reduced our availability under the line of credit.\nContractual Obligations\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations are described in the accompanying notes to the financial statements withinI tem 8. Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data. These include principal and interest payments on long-term debt as described inN ote 6. Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, operating\nleases as described in Note 11. Leases and purchase commitments as described in Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition\nand results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Management considers an accounting estimate to be\ncritical if it is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty, and has had, or is reasonably likely to\nhave, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We consider policies and estimates relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:\n29\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue at the amount we expect to be entitled to be paid, determined when control of the products or services is transferred to our customers, which occurs upon\ndelivery of and acceptance of the fruit by the customer and we have a right to payment. For grove management services, we recognize operating revenue, including a\nmanagement fee, when services are rendered and consumed. Management reviews the reasonableness of the revenue accruals quarterly based on buyers’ and processors’\nadvances to growers, cash and futures markets and experience in the industry. Adjustments are made throughout the year to these estimates as more current relevant industry\ninformation becomes available. Differences between the estimates and the final realization of revenues can be significant and can be either positive or negative. During the\nperiods presented in this Annual Report, no material adjustments were made to the reported revenues from our crops.\nInventories\nThe costs of growing crops, including, but not limited to, labor, fertilization, fuel, crop nutrition and irrigation, are capitalized into inventory throughout the respective crop\nyear. Such costs are expensed as cost of sales when the crops are harvested and are recorded as operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inventories are\nstated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost for unharvested citrus crops is based on accumulated production costs incurred during the period from January 1\nthrough the balance sheet date. In the event that there is a casualty loss due to severe weather or other significant incident which negatively impacts inventory, we will undertake\na process to estimate the amount of casualty loss. The process includes a number of factors, including touring all of the citrus groves by operational personnel, to assess the\nestimated fruit drop by grove and estimate the amount of fruit we expect to produce for the respective harvest season. As a result of this process, we would estimate the amount\nof casualty loss, if any, to reduce the carrying value of unharvested fruit crop on trees inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Major improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed in\nthe period the cost is incurred. Costs related to the development of citrus groves, through planting of trees, are capitalized. Such costs include land clearing, excavation and\nconstruction of ditches, dikes, roads and reservoirs among other costs. After the planting, caretaking costs or pre-productive maintenance costs are capitalized for four years.\nAfter four years, a grove is considered to have reached maturity and the accumulated costs are depreciated over 25 years, except for land clearing and excavation, which are\nconsidered costs of land and not depreciated.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those deferred as a\nresult of temporary differences between the financial statements and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using\nenacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in\nincome tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Projected\nfuture taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered and evaluated when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Any increase or decrease in a\nvaluation allowance could have a material adverse or beneficial impact on our income tax provision and net income or loss in the period the determination is made. For the years\nended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we recorded a valuation allowance of $4,170 thousand and $4,309 thousand, respectively. We recognize interest and/or\npenalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest\namount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs. We record\ninterest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations, other than goodwill, when events and circumstances indicate that the asset or asset group\nmight be impaired and the estimated cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by those assets or asset group over the remaining lives of the assets\nare less than the carrying amounts of those assets. In calculating impairments and the estimated cash flows, we assign its asset groups by determining the lowest level for which\nthere are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of the other Company assets. The net carrying values of assets or asset groups not recoverable are\nreduced to their fair values. Our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimates of future market conditions and operating conditions. As\nof September 30, 2023 and 2022, long-lived assets were comprised of property and equipment.\n30\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements\nWe categorize our financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability into a three-tier fair value\nhierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n• Level 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;\n• Level 2 – Inputs, other than the quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, for which significant other observable market inputs are readily\navailable; and\n• Level 3 – Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, such as internally developed valuation models which require the reporting entity to develop its\nown assumptions.\nThe carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities\napproximate their fair values due to the short term and immediate nature of these financial instruments. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information about the fair value of our debt.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any assets held for sale that had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nImpact of Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” – Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nthis Annual Report for additional information about the impact of accounting pronouncements.\n31\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket Risk – Market risk represents the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments, either derivative or non-derivative, caused by\nfluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity security prices. We handle market risks in accordance with our established policies; however,\nwe do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We do consider, on occasion, the need to enter into financial instruments to\nmanage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates; however, we entered into no such instruments during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. We held various\nfinancial instruments as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, consisting of financial assets and liabilities reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and off-balance sheet\nexposures resulting from letters of credit issued for our benefit.\nInterest Rate Risk – We are subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments such as term loan debt and other borrowings. Our primary long-term\nobligations are fixed rate debts subject to fair value risk due to interest rate fluctuations.\nWe are also subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt. A one-percentage-point increase in prevailing interest rates would have increased interest expense on our\nvariable rate debt obligations by approximately $438 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nForeign-Exchange Rate Risk – We currently have no exposure to foreign-exchange rate risk because all of our financial transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nCommodity Price Risk – We have no financial instruments subject to commodity price risk.\nEquity Security Price Risk – None of our financial instruments have potential exposure to equity security price risk.\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated December 6, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nNet Realizable Value of Unharvested Fruit Crop on the Trees\nAs described within Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. At September 30, 2023, the\nconsolidated inventory balance included unharvested fruit crop on the trees of $50,699,000. The Company assesses the carrying value of unharvested fruit crop\non the trees, including the determination of adjustments to net realizable value, by applying judgment in developing estimates such as the expected future crop\nyield and future citrus pricing.\nWe identified the net realizable value of unharvested fruit crop on the trees as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments utilized by\nmanagement in developing the accounting estimate. Auditing management’s estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and\nincreased audit effort due to the impact these assumptions have on the net realizable value of unharvested fruit crop on the trees.\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s estimates and assumptions of the net realizable value of unharvested fruit crop on the trees included the\nfollowing, among others:\n34\nTable of Contents\n• We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to management’s evaluation of the net realizable value of unharvested fruit crop on the\ntrees, and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls around management’s evaluation of the expected future crop\nyield and future citrus pricing.\n• We tested the completeness of the population of unharvested fruit crop on the trees that were subject to net realizable value adjustments.\n• We recalculated the mathematical accuracy of the net realizable value of unharvested fruit crop on the trees.\n• We performed a comparison of management’s prior forecasts of future crop yield and future citrus pricing to actual results.\n• We performed site observations and obtained industry data to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates of future crop yield and future\ncitrus pricing.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nOrlando, Florida\nDecember 6, 2023\n35\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alico, Inc.\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Alico, Inc.'s and its subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established\nin Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity and cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report\ndated December 6, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nOrlando, Florida\nDecember 6, 2023\n36\nTable of Contents\nALICO, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except

Contents\nALICO, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nAlico, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “Alico”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), is a Florida agribusiness and land management company owning\napproximately 72,000 acres of land and also mineral rights throughout Florida. Alico holds these mineral rights on substantially all its owned acres, with additional mineral\nrights on other acres. The Company manages its land based upon its primary usage, and reviews its performance based upon two primary classifications: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii)\nLand Management and Other Operations. Financial results are presented based upon these two business segments (Alico Citrus and Land Management and Other Operations).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company has prepared the accompanying financial statements on a consolidated basis. These accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, which are referred to\nherein as the “Financial Statements,” have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and\npursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All significant intercompany transactions and account balances between the\nconsolidated businesses have been eliminated.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined in the criteria established under the Financial Accounting Standards Board – Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) Topic 280 as\ncomponents of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and\nwhich is evaluated regularly by John E. Kiernan, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), in deciding how to\nassess performance and allocate resources. The Company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on two operating segments: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii)\nLand Management and Other Operations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Financial Statements include the accounts of Alico and the accounts of all the subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is held by the Company. Under U.S. GAAP,\nconsolidation is generally required for investments of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of an investee, except when control is not held by the majority owner. The\nCompany’s subsidiaries include: Alico Land Development, Inc., Alico-Agri, Ltd., Alico Plant World, LLC, Alico Fruit Company, LLC, Alico Citrus Nursery, LLC, Alico\nChemical Sales, LLC, 734 Citrus Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries, Alico Skink Mitigation, LLC and Citree Holdings 1, LLC (“Citree”). The Company considers the criteria\nestablished under FASB ASC Topic 810, “Consolidations” in its consolidation process. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities as of the date of the accompanying Financial Statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the\naccompanying Notes, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and cash flows during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The\nCompany evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis. The estimates are based on current and expected economic conditions, historical experience, the experience and judgment of\nthe Company’s management and various other specific assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable.\nNoncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Subsidiary\nThe Financial Statements include all assets and liabilities of the less-than-100%-owned subsidiary the Company controls, Citree. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a\nnoncontrolling interest in the equity of such entity. Citree had a net loss of $361 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2023, a net loss of $1,170 thousand for the year\nended September 30, 2022, and a net loss of $79 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2021, respectively, of which a net loss of $184 thousand, a net loss of $597\nthousand, and a net loss of $41 thousand were attributable to the Company for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net loss for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily due to lower revenue as a result of the fruit drop from Hurricane Ian. The net loss for the year ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to\nthe inventory casualty loss and net realizable value adjustment as result of the fruit loss sustained from Hurricane Ian.\n41\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which\nprovides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected\nby reference rate reform. The Company’s floating rate notes and variable funding notes have historically borne interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. Given the\nanticipated cessation of LIBOR, the Company renegotiated its variable rate loan agreements, to instead utilize fluctuating interest rates based on the 30 day Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR), some with the change having taken effect late in the year ended September 30, 2022, and one with the change having taken effect early in the year\nended September 30, 2023. ASU 2020-04 was effective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate\nReform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, to extend the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The adoption of this standard will not\nhave a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as it has converted all of its variable rate loan agreements from LIBOR to SOFR as noted above.\nThe Company has reviewed other recently issued accounting standards which have not yet been adopted to determine their potential effect, if any, on the results of operations or\nfinancial condition. Based on the review of these other recently issued standards, the Company does not currently believe that any of those accounting pronouncements will\nhave a significant effect on its current or future financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the accompanying Financial Statements for consistent presentation to the current period. These reclassifications had no\nimpact on net income, equity, cash flows or working capital as previously reported.\nSeasonality\nThe Company is primarily engaged in the production of fruit for sale to citrus markets, which is of a seasonal nature, and subject to the influence of natural phenomena and\nwide price fluctuations. Historically, the second and third quarters of Alico’s year produce most of the Company’s annual revenue. Working capital requirements are typically\ngreater in the first and fourth quarters of the year, coinciding with harvesting cycles. Because of the seasonality of the business, results for any quarter are not necessarily\nindicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year ended September 30.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are derived from the sale of processed fruit, fresh fruit, other citrus revenue, revenues from grove management services, leasing revenue and other resource revenues.\nMost of the revenue is generated from the sale of citrus fruit to processing facilities, fresh fruit sales and grove management services.\nFor fruit sales, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount it expects to be entitled to be paid, determined when control of the products or services is transferred to its\ncustomers, which occurs upon delivery of and acceptance of the fruit by the customer and when the Company has a right to payment.\nFor the sale of fruit, the Company has identified one performance obligation, which is the delivery of fruit to the processing facility of the customer (or harvesting of the citrus\nin the case of fresh fruit) for each separate variety of fruit identified in the respective contract with the respective customer. The Company initially recognizes revenue in an\namount which is estimated based on contractual and market prices, if such market price falls within the range (known as “floor” and “ceiling” prices) identified in the specific\nrespective contracts. Additionally, the Company also has a contractual agreement whereby revenue is determined based on applying a cost-plus structure methodology. As such,\nsince all these contracts contain elements of variable consideration, the Company recognizes this variable consideration by using the expected value method. On a quarterly\nbasis, management reviews the reasonableness of the revenues accrued based on buyers’ and processors’ advances to growers, cash and futures markets and experience in the\nindustry. Adjustments are made throughout the year to these estimates as more current relevant industry information becomes available. Differences between the estimates and\nthe final realization of revenues at the close of the harvesting season can result in either an increase or decrease to reported revenues.\nReceivables under contracts, whereby pricing is based on contractual and market prices, are primarily paid at the floor amount and are collected within seven days after the\nharvest week. Any adjustments to pricing as a result of changes in market prices are generally collected or paid thirty to sixty days after final market pricing is published.\nReceivables under those contracts where pricing is based off a cost-plus structure methodology are paid at the final prior year rate. Any adjustments to pricing because of the\ncost-plus calculation are collected or paid upon finalization of the calculation and agreement by both parties. As of September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2022, the Company\nhad total receivables relating to sales of citrus of $394 thousand and $171 thousand, respectively, recorded in Accounts Receivable, net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n42\nTable of Contents\nFor grove management services, the Company has identified one performance obligation, which is the management of the third party’s groves. Grove management services\ninclude caretaking of the citrus groves, harvesting and hauling of citrus, management and coordination of citrus sales and other related activities. The Company is reimbursed for\nexpenses incurred in the execution of its management duties and the Company receives a per acre management fee. The Company recognizes operating revenue, including a\nmanagement fee, and corresponding operating expenses when such services are rendered and consumed.\nIn June 2022, a group of third-party grove owners, who are affiliated with each other (collectively, the “Grove Owners”), for which the Company was managing groves under a\nProperty Management Agreement executed on July 16, 2020 with the Grove Owners, under which the Company performed grove management services, terminated the\nmanagement relationship under the Property Management Agreement with the Company as the Grove Owners decided to exit the citrus business. As a result, all services\nrelating to this Property Management Agreement and the accompanying management fee and reimbursed costs associated with performing grove management services ceased\nas of June 10, 2022.\nThe Company recorded $0, $10,598 thousand and $15,752 thousand of operating revenue relating to these grove management services, including the management fee, during\nthe years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded $0, $9,711 thousand and $14,342 thousand of operating expenses relating to these\ngrove management services during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nRevenues disaggregated by significant products and services for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n(in thousands) Years Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nAlico Citrus\nEarly and Mid-Season $ 11,954 $ 28,287 $ 31,525\nValencias 23,906 47,529 55,918\nFresh Fruit and other 1,051 1,937 1,370\nGrove Management Services 1,234 11,928 16,983\nTotal $ 38,145 $ 89,681 $ 105,796\nLand Management and Other Operations\nLand and Other Leasing $ 1,327 $ 1,655 $ 2,404\nOther 374 611 364\nTotal $ 1,701 $ 2,266 $ 2,768\nTotal Revenues $ 39,846 $ 91,947 $ 108,564\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability into a three-\ntier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n• Level 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;\n• Level 2 – Inputs, other than the quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, for which significant other observable market inputs are readily\navailable; and\n• Level 3 – Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, such as internally developed valuation models which require the reporting entity to develop its\nown assumptions.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities approximate their fair values due to the short term and immediate nature of these financial instruments.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values (Level 2) of debt instruments are as follows:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nEstimated Fair Estimated Fair\nCarrying Amount Value Carrying Amount Value\nCorporate debt\nCurrent long-term debt $ 2,566 $ 2,325 $ 3,035 $ 2,847\nLong-term debt $ 126,753 $ 115,851 $ 108,589 $ 102,558\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any assets held for sale that had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers cash in banks and highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. At various times\nthroughout the year ended September 30, and as of September 30, 2023, some accounts held at financial institutions were in excess of the federally insured limit of $250\nthousand. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts and believes credit risk to be minimal.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash is comprised of cash received from the sale of certain assets in which the use of funds is restricted. For certain sales transactions, the Company sells property\nwhich serves as collateral for specific debt obligations and/or for which the Company intends to complete a (“1031 Exchange”) under section 1031 of the Internal Revenue\nCode. A 1031 Exchange allows a taxpayer to defer all or a portion of income taxes on the sale of real property provided it can identify replacement real property within 45 days\nand close on the purchase of the replacement real property within 180 days after the closing of the initial sale. If an acceptable transaction is not consummated within this time\nperiod, the Company will need to pay income taxes on the gain from the sales transaction.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable from customers are generated from revenues based on the sale of citrus, grove management, leasing and other transactions. The Company grants credit in\nthe course of its operations to third party customers. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not require\ncollateral. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts which are not probable of collection. The estimate, evaluated quarterly by the Company, is\nbased on historical collection experience, current macroeconomic climate and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customer’s account. Changes in the\nfinancial viability of significant customers and worsening of economic conditions may require changes to its estimate of the recoverability of the receivables. Such changes in\nestimates are recorded in the period in which these changes become known. The bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nThe following table presents accounts receivable, net, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022:\n(in thousands) September 30,\n2023 2022\nAccounts receivable $ 726 $ 338\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (14) (14)\nAccounts receivable, net $ 712 $ 324\n44\nTable of Contents\nConcentrations\nAccounts receivable from the Company’s major customer as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and revenue from such customer for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, are as follows:\n(in thousands) Accounts Receivable Revenue % of Total Revenue\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021\nTropicana $ — $ — $ 32,403 $ 73,791 $ 84,136 81.3 % 79.7 % 77.5 %\nThe citrus industry is subject to various factors over which growers have limited or no control, including weather conditions, disease, pestilence, water supply and market price\nfluctuations. Market prices are highly sensitive to aggregate domestic and foreign crop sizes, as well as factors including, but not limited to, weather and competition from\nforeign countries.\nThe overall increase in Tropicana revenue, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to lower caretaking revenue due to the termination in June 2022 of the agreement entered\ninto in July 2020 with a group of third-party grove owners, who were affiliated with each other, to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services for\n7,000 acres owned by such third parties. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company was reimbursed by the third parties for all its costs incurred related to providing these\nservices and received a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement. The Company records both an increase in revenues and expenses when the Company\nprovides these citrus grove caretaking management services.\nReal Estate\nIn February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, “Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets” (ASC 610-20): This standard clarified\nthe Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets and clarified the scope and application of ASC 610-20 on the sale, transfer,\nand derecognition of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to non-customers, including partial sales. The standard provided guidance on how gains and losses\non transfers of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to non-customers are recognized. The Company recognizes a gain on the sale of real estate as outlined by\nASC 610-20.\nInventories\nThe costs of growing crops, including but not limited to labor, fertilization, fuel, crop nutrition, irrigation, and depreciation, are capitalized into inventory throughout the\nrespective crop year. Such costs are expensed as cost of sales when the crops are harvested and are recorded as operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost for unharvested citrus crops is based on accumulated production costs incurred during the period from\nJanuary 1 through the balance sheet date.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance\nand repairs are expensed when incurred. Costs related to the development of citrus groves through planting of trees are capitalized. Such costs include land clearing, excavation\nand construction of ditches, dikes, roads, and reservoirs, among other costs. After the planting, caretaking costs or pre-productive maintenance costs are capitalized for 4 years.\nAfter 4 years, a planting is considered to have reached maturity and the accumulated costs are depreciated over 25 years, except for land clearing and excavation, which are\nconsidered costs of land and not depreciated.\nReal estate costs incurred for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate projects are capitalized.\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets, with the exception of leasehold improvements and assets acquired\nthrough capital leases, which are depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the lease transfers ownership or contains a bargain purchase option, otherwise the term of the\nlease.\nThe estimated useful lives for property and equipment are primarily as follows:\nCitrus trees 25 years\nEquipment and other facilities 3-20 years\nBuildings and improvements 15-39 years\nChanges in circumstances, such as technological advances, or changes to our business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the original\nestimates. In those cases where the Company determines that the useful\n45\nTable of Contents\nlife of property and equipment should be shortened, Alico depreciates the asset over its revised estimated remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense (see\nNote 5. Property and Equipment, Net for further information).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. The Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations, or asset group, when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be\nimpaired and the estimated cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by those assets or asset group over the remaining lives of the assets or asset\ngroup are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. In calculating impairments and the estimated cash flows, the Company assigns its asset groups by determining the\nlowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of the other Company assets. The net carrying values of assets or asset\ngroup not recoverable are reduced to their fair values. Alico’s cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect best estimates of future market conditions and\noperating conditions. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not recognize any impairment of long-lived assets. As of September 30, 2023\nand 2022, long-lived assets were comprised of property and equipment.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed in connection with such acquisition.\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives acquired in an acquisition are not\namortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, on the same date, or more frequently, should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating\nperformance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof.\nThe carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of September 30, and, additionally on an interim basis, whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The accounting standards for goodwill allow for the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company does not utilize a qualitative assessment approach, then the quantitative\ngoodwill impairment test is utilized to identify potential impairments. The Company identifies any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to\nits fair value. The Company typically determines the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation approach. If a potential impairment is identified, the\nCompany will determine the amount of goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, no\nimpairment was required.\nOther Non-Current Assets\nOther non-current assets primarily include intangible assets relating to mineral rights, water permits, right-of-use assets relating to lease obligations, investments owned in\nagricultural cooperatives, cash surrender value on life insurance, and deposits on the purchase of citrus trees. Investments in stock related to agricultural cooperatives are carried\nat cost.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those\ndeferred as a result of temporary differences between the financial statements and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The\neffect of a change in income tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation\nallowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not\nbe realized. Projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered and evaluated when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Any increase\nor decrease in a valuation allowance could have a material adverse or beneficial impact on the Company’s income tax provision and net income or loss in the period the\ndetermination is made. See Note 9. Income Taxes for detail of valuation allowances recognized during the year ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The Company\nrecognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at\nthe largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs.\nThe Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\n46\nTable of Contents\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share for the Company’s common stock is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Alico common stockholders by the weighted average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share is similarly calculated, except that the calculation includes the dilutive effect of the\nassumed issuance of shares of common stock issuable under equity-based compensation plans in accordance with the treasury stock method, or any other type of securities\nconvertible into common stock, except where the inclusion of such common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(in thousands) Years Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding – Basic 7,602 7,560 7,516\nEffect of dilutive securities – stock options and unrestricted stock — 8 3\nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding – Diluted 7,602 7,568 7,519\nNon-vested restricted shares of common stock entitle the holder to receive non-forfeitable dividends upon issuance and are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per\ncommon share.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured based on the fair value of the equity award at the grant date and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Upon the\nvesting of restricted stock, the Company issues common stock from common shares held in treasury. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. See Note\n8. Stock-based Compensation for a discussion of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.\nNote 3. Inventories\nInventories consist of the following at September 30, 2023 and 2022:\n(in thousands) September 30,\n2023 2022\nUnharvested fruit crop on the trees $ 50,699 $ 26,717\nOther 1,782 965\nTotal inventories $ 52,481 $ 27,682\nThe Company records its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nIn September 2022, the state of Florida’s citrus business, including the Company’s unharvested citrus crop, was significantly impacted by Hurricane Ian. The impact of\nHurricane Ian resulted in the premature drop of unharvested fruit. Accordingly, for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $1,616 thousand and\n$6,676 thousand, respectively, for adjustments to reduce inventory to net realizable value as a result of the impact of Hurricane Ian, which impacted the Company’s unharvested\ncitrus crop for the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company undertook a process to estimate the amount of inventory casualty loss as of the date of Hurricane Ian. Such\nprocess included a number of factors including touring all of the citrus groves by operational personnel to assess the estimated fruit drop by grove and the impact of damage to\nthe citrus trees, and an estimate of fruit the Company expects to produce for the 2022-2023 harvest season after Hurricane Ian. As a result, the Company recorded, for the year\nended September 30, 2022, a casualty loss to reduce the carrying value of unharvested fruit crop on trees inventory by $14,900 thousand.\nIn the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company received insurance proceeds relating to Hurricane Ian of approximately $27,389 thousand for crop claims and $839\nthousand relating to property and casualty damage claims, which have been recorded as a reduction in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No\nfurther insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Ian are expected.\nIn December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law by the federal government; however, the details of the mechanism and funding of any Hurricane\nIan relief still remains unclear and, if available, the extent to which we will be eligible. We intend to take advantage of any such available programs as and when they become\navailable. We are currently working with Florida Citrus Mutual, the industry trade group, and government agencies on the federal relief programs available as part of the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe Company was eligible for Hurricane Irma federal relief programs for block grants that were being administered through the State of Florida. During the years ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company received $1,315 thousand, $1,123 thousand and $4,299 thousand, respectively, under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block\nGrant (“CRBG”) program. No further federal relief proceeds are expected related to Hurricane Irma. These federal relief proceeds are included as a reduction to operating\nexpenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNote 4.

The sale is expected to close between December 2023 and February\n2024.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, we sold approximately 2,255 acres of ranch land for approximately $12,000 thousand and recognized a gain of $11,432 thousand\n(including approximately 85 acres to Mr. John E. Kiernan, the Company’s President and CEO, on October 20, 2022, for $439 thousand ($5,161 per acre)). See Note 13. Related\nParty Transactions for further information.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022 we sold approximately 9,414 acres of ranch land for $41,421 thousand and recognized a gain of $39,124 thousand.\nThe Company recorded no impairment loss during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, these proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

The security for the term loans and RLOC consists of3 8,200 gross acres of citrus groves and originally included 5,800\ngross acres of ranch land. In April 2021, the 5,800 gross acres of ranch land was released as security against the term loans and RLOC and only the3 8,200 gross acres of citrus\ngroves remain as security for the term loans and RLOC. The WCLC is collateralized by the Company’s current assets and certain other personal property owned by the\nCompany.\nInitially, the Met Fixed-Rate Term Loans were subject to quarterly principal payments of $1,563 thousand and bore interest at 4.15% per annum. Effective May 1, 2021, the\nCompany modified its Met Fixed-Rate Term Loans, which, in the aggregate, have a balance of $70,000 thousand after the prepayment of $10,313 thousand made in April 2021,\nand have a balance of $70,000 thousand to be interest-only, with a balloon payment to be paid at maturity on November 1, 2029. The interest rate on these Met Fixed-Rate Term\nLoans, which were bearing interest at 4.15%, was adjusted to 3.85%.

Effective February 17, 2023, the Company agreed to defer the next three quarterly principal payments which were previously due May 2023,\nAugust 2023 and November 2023 to the maturity date of the loan. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the LIBOR rate was effective from October 1, 2021 through July 31,\n2022. The LIBOR spread was subject to adjustment by Met beginning May 1, 2017 and was subject to further adjustment every two years thereafter until maturity. No\nadjustment was made at May 1, 2019, or at May 1, 2021. Effective August 1, 2022, the interest rate was renegotiated to the One Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(SOFR) plus 175 basis points (the “SOFR spread”). The SOFR spread is subject to adjustment by Met every2 years beginning May 1, 2023, until maturity. Interest on the term\nloans is payable quarterly. The interest rates on the Met Variable-Rate Term Loans were 7.52% per annum and 4.27% per annum, as of September 30, 2023 and September 30,\n2022, respectively. The Met Variable-Rate Term Loans mature on November 1, 2029.\nWith respect to the RLOC, for the year ended September 30, 2022, the LIBOR-based rate was effective from October 1, 2021 through July 31, 2022 and bears interest at a\nfloating rate equal to 90-day LIBOR plus 165 basis points, payable quarterly.

The variable interest rate was7 .52% per annum and\n4.27% per annum as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nThe WCLC is a revolving credit facility and is available for funding working capital and general corporate requirements. The WCLC agreement was amended on October 27,\n2022, and the primary terms of the amendment were an extension of the maturity to November 1, 2025, and the conversion of the interest rate from LIBOR plus a spread to\nSOFR plus a spread, which spread is adjusted quarterly, based on the Company’s debt service coverage ratio for the preceding quarter and can vary from 175 to 250 basis points.\nThere were no changes to the commitment amount. The rate at September 30, 2023 was SOFR plus1 75 basis points. The variable interest rate was 7.07% per annum and 4.31%\nper annum as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The WCLC agreement provides for Rabo to issue up to $2,000 thousand in letters of credit on the\nCompany’s behalf, of which $248 thousand and $310 thousand were issued as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nThe WCLC is subject to a quarterly commitment fee on the daily unused availability under the line computed as the commitment amount less the aggregate of the outstanding\nloans and outstanding letters of credit. The commitment fee is adjusted quarterly based on Alico’s debt service coverage ratio for the preceding quarter and can vary from a\nminimum of\n50\nTable of Contents\n20 basis points to a maximum of 30 basis points. Commitment fees to date have been charged at 20 basis points, except from May 18, 2023 through August 8, 2023 when they\nwere charged at 30 basis points.\nThese credit facilities noted above are subject to various covenants, including the following financial covenants: (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio of1 .10 to 1.00; (ii)\ntangible net worth of at least $160,000 thousand increased annually by 10% of consolidated net income for the preceding years, or $174,628 thousand applicable for the year\nended September 30, 2023; (iii) minimum current ratio of 1.50 to 1.00; (iv) debt to total assets ratio not greater than. 625 to 1.00; and (v) solely in the case of the WCLC, a limit\non capital expenditures of $30,000 thousand per year ended September 30. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants.\nCredit facilities also include a Met Life term loan collateralized by 1,200 gross acres of citrus grove owned by Citree (“Met Citree Loan”). This is a $5,000 thousand credit\nfacility that bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.28% per annum. Principal and interest payments are made on a quarterly basis. Effective February 17, 2023, the Company agreed\nto defer the next three quarterly principal payments which were previously due May 2023, August 2023 and November 2023 to the maturity date of the loan. The loan matures\nin February 2029.\nSilver Nip Citrus Debt\nThere are two fixed-rate term loans, with an original combined balance of $27,550 thousand, bearing interest at 5.35% per annum (“Pru Loans A & B”).

The Company may prepay up to $5,000 thousand of principal without penalty. As such, the Company exceeded the allowed $5,000 thousand\nprepayment by $203 thousand and was required to make a premium payment of $22 thousand. The loans are collateralized by approximately 5,700 acres of citrus groves in\nCollier, Hardee, Highlands and Polk Counties, Florida and mature on June 1, 2029 and June 1, 2033, respectively.\nThe Pru Loans A & B are subject to a financial covenant whereby the consolidated current ratio requirement is 1.00 to 1.00. Silver Nip Citrus was in compliance with the current\nratio covenant as of September 30, 2023.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nCosts incurred to obtain financing are deferred and amortized to \"Interest expense\" in the consolidated statement of operations over the related financing period using the\neffective interest method.

Segment Information\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined in the criteria established under the FASB ASC Topic 280 as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they\nmay earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker\n(“CODM”) in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on two operating\nsegments: Alico Citrus and Land Management and Other Operations.\nTotal revenues represent sales to unaffiliated customers, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goods and services produced by these segments are sold to\nwholesalers and processors in the United States who prepare the products for consumption. The Company evaluates the segments’ performance based on direct margins (gross\nprofit) from operations before general and administrative expenses, interest expense, other income (expense) and income taxes, not including nonrecurring gains and losses.\n54\nTable of Contents\nInformation by operating segment is as follows:\n(in thousands) Years Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues:\nAlico Citrus $ 38,145 $ 89,681 $ 105,796\nLand Management and Other Operations 1,701 2,266 2,768\nTotal revenues 39,846 91,947 108,564\nOperating expenses:\nAlico Citrus 32,959 106,192 83,893\nLand Management and Other Operations 441 520 778\nTotal operating expenses 33,400 106,712 84,671\nGross profit (loss):\nAlico Citrus 5,186 (16,511) 21,903\nLand Management and Other Operations 1,260 1,746 1,990\nTotal gross profit (loss) $ 6,446 $ (14,765) $ 23,893\nCapital expenditures:\nAlico Citrus $ 16,733 $ 20,867 $ 41,785\nTotal capital expenditures $ 16,733 $ 20,867 $ 41,785\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization:\nAlico Citrus $ 14,999 $ 14,697 $ 14,523\nLand Management and Other Operations 67 98 147\nOther Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 421 434 452\nTotal depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 15,487 $ 15,229 $ 15,122\nAssets:\nAlico Citrus $ 415,030 $ 396,266\nLand Management and Other Operations 11,722 11,326\nOther Corporate Assets 1,601 1,663\nTotal Assets $ 428,353 $ 409,255\nNote 11. Leases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company’s leases consist of operating lease arrangements for certain office space, tractor leases\nand IT facilities. When these lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components (e.g.,\ncommon area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.\nAny lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and it recognizes lease cost for these lease\narrangements on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term. Many lease arrangements provide the options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease\narrangement. When the options are reasonably certain to be exercised the Company includes these options when it will be reasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term\nused to establish the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Generally, lease agreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees or\nmaterial restrictive covenants.\n55\nTable of Contents\nAs most of our lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the\ncommencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments.\nNo lease costs associated with finance leases and sale-leaseback transactions occurred and our lease income associated with lessor and sublease arrangements are not material to\nour Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur operating leases are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nOperating lease components Classification 2023 2022\nRight-of-use assets – non-current Other non-current assets $ 523 $ 755\nCurrent lease liabilities Other current liabilities $ 254 $ 415\nNon-current lease liabilities Other liabilities $ 305 $ 386\nOur operating leases cost components are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nOperating lease components Classification 2023 2022\nGrove management services revenue Operating revenue $ — $ 116\nGrove management services cost-of-sales Operating expenses $ — $ 116\nOperating lease costs General and administrative\nexpenses $ 128 $ 85\nFuture maturities of our operating lease obligations as of September 30, 2023, by year, are as follows:\n(in thousands)\n2024 $ 255\n2025 159\n2026 145\n2027 26\n2028 —\nTotal noncancelable future lease obligations $ 585\nLess: Interest (26)\nPresent value of lease obligations $ 559\nSeptember 30, 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 1.90 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 5.22%\n56\nTable of Contents\nCash flow information related to leases consists of the following:\n(in thousands) September 30, September 30,\n2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 211 $ 302\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:\nOperating leases $ 184 $ —\nNote 12.

The remaining portion of the Contribution of $440 thousand was\nfunded by the noncontrolling parties.\nOn September 6, 2022, all operating partners of Citree received a funding notice relating to an additional Contribution requirement of $600 thousand as a result of trees\nproducing limited revenue because they are still in early-stage development, a freeze event occurred in January 2022 which negatively impacted both the box production and\npounds solids, and the increased cost of fertilizer, other chemicals and fuel. The Company’s portion of the Contribution was $306 thousand and was funded on September 22,\n2022.

There are no\ncurrent legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any of its property is subject that it believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial position,\nresults of operations or cash flows.\nOn February 17, 2023, a class action complaint was filed in the Middle District of Florida captioned Sinder v. Alico, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:23-cv-00107 (the “Sinder” matter)\nasserting violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 against the Company and certain of its current and former officers on behalf of a putative class of\ninvestors who purchased the Company’s common stock between February 4, 2021 and December 13, 2022. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the Company and\ncertain of its current and former officers made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose certain information regarding the Company’s financial reporting and\nDecember 13, 2022 restatement of the Company’s previously issued financial statements.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are\nresource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n(b) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, with the participation of Alico's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and\nprocedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) as of the end of the period\ncovered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n(c) Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses were previously disclosed in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first, second, and third quarters ended December 31, 2022,\nMarch 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023. Specifically, management identified the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022\narising from the following control deficiencies:\n• We identified a deficiency as it related to controls around the completeness and accuracy of the information used in the preparation of its income tax provision.\n• We did not design effective controls surrounding the evaluation of misstatements and the impact to the financial statements for all periods presented.\nThroughout the year ended September 30, 2023, we undertook remediation measures related to the previously reported material weaknesses in internal control over financial\nreporting. We completed these remediation measures in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, including testing of the design and concluding on the operating effectiveness of\nthe related controls. Specifically, we undertook the following measures:\n• We designed and implemented new controls around the preparation and review of our income tax provision and hired personnel with accounting expertise that has\nenhanced our accounting and financial reporting team.\n• We changed our process of evaluating misstatements and designed and implemented a new process to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors to ensure all\nperiods presented are included in any such evaluation of misstatements.\nWe have completed the design and implementation of remediation measures to strengthen the effectiveness and operation of our internal control environment. Based on these\nprocedures, we believe that the material weaknesses have been remediated. However, completion of remediation procedures for these material weaknesses does not provide\nassurance that these remediation efforts will prevent or detect future material weaknesses, that our modified controls will continue to operate properly or that our financial\nstatements will be free from error.\n(d) Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial\n59\nTable of Contents\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the\ncriteria described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).\nBased on the Company's assessment and those criteria, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nThe conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, has been audited by RSM US LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.\n(e) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed its remediation efforts as discussed above. The design of these controls has been formalized\nwithin the internal control framework. In addition, as a result of the remediation efforts described above, new or revised process controls have been applied to internal controls\nover financial reporting. All these changes to the Company’s processes and controls have been, and will continue to be, subject to the Company’s program for evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. There were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during\nthe year ended September 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

It is subject to, and\nqualified in its entirety by reference to, our Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended from time to time (the “Articles of Incorporation”), and our Second Amended and\nRestated Bylaws, as amended from time to time (our “Bylaws”)and applicable provisions of The Florida Business Corporation Act (the “FBCA”).\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nOur authorized capital stock consists of\n• 15,000,000 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share; and\n• 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value per share.\nCommon Stock\nDividends. Subject to preferential dividend rights of any other class or series of stock, the holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive, to the extent permitted\nby law, dividends, including dividends of our stock. Such dividends may be declared from time to time by the board of directors. The payment of cash dividends in the future\nwill be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition. Further, our ability to declare dividends is limited by restrictive\ncovenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness.\nRegistration Rights. On February 11, 2019, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Remy W. Trafelet, our former\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other parties. The Settlement Agreement, via the registration rights agreement attached to the Settlement Agreement, grants\nregistration rights to Remy W. Trafelet and his affiliates.\nLiquidation. In the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolvation or our affairs are wound up, after we pay or make adequate provision for all of our known debts\nand liabilities, each holder of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably, in proportion to the number of shares of common stock held by such holder, in all assets that\nremain, subject to any rights that are granted to the holders of any class or series of preferred stock.\nVoting Rights. For all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share registered in the holder’s name.\nHolders of our common stock vote together as a single class. There is no cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which means that, subject to any rights to elect\ndirectors that are granted to the holders of any class or series of preferred stock, a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present is\nsufficient to elect a director.\nOther Rights and Restrictions. Subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of stock, all shares of our common stock have equal dividend, distribution,\nliquidation and other rights, and have no preference, appraisal or exchange rights, except for any appraisal rights provided by Florida law. Furthermore, holders of our common\nstock have no conversion, sinking fund or redemption rights, or preemptive rights to subscribe for any of our securities. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not restrict\nthe ability of a holder of our common stock to transfer the holder’s shares of our common stock and do not discriminate against any existing or prospective holder of our\ncommon stock as a result of such security holder owning a substantial amount of our securities.\nThe rights, powers, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of shares of our\noutstanding preferred stock and of any series of preferred stock which we may designate and issue in the future.\nListing. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol ALCO.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar. The transfer agent for our common stock is Computershare Inc.\nPreferred Stock\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation we have authority, subject to any limitations prescribed by law and without further shareholder approval, to issue from time to time, as\n“blank check preferred,” up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\nThe preferred stock is issuable in one or more series, each with such designations, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions as our board of directors may\ndetermine in resolutions providing for their issuance.\nIn particular, our board of directors, without further approval of the shareholders, is authorized to fix the dividend rights and terms, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption\nrights and terms, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each series of the preferred stock. The issuance of preferred\nstock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could, among other things, adversely affect the voting power or rights of\nthe holders of our common stock and, under certain circumstances, make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us, discourage bids for our common stock at a\npremium or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the common stock. Further, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a\nchange in control of us without further action by the shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of\npreferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock, including loss of voting control to others.\nAs of December 1, 2023, all 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock remain unissued and no shares of preferred stock are authorized for any specific series.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Florida Law, Our Articles of Incorporation and Our Bylaws\nSome provisions of Florida law, our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws contain provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult: acquisitions of us by\nmeans of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise or removal of our incumbent officers and directors. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our\nmanagement. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that shareholders may otherwise consider to be in their\nbest interest or in our best interests, including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares.\nThese provisions are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to\nacquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection and our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or\nunsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could\nresult in an improvement of their terms.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Florida Law. The following summarizes certain anti-takeover effects of Florida Law.\nAuthorized but Unissued Stock. Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuance without shareholder approval.\nThese additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit\nplans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of stock may enable our board of directors to issue shares of stock to persons friendly to existing management. This may\nhave the effect of discouraging attempts to obtain control of the Company. The perception in the market of a large number of authorized but unissued shares of our common and\npreferred stock could have a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nEvaluation of Impact of Acquisition Proposals on Non-Shareholder Constituencies. The FBCA expressly permits our board of directors, when evaluating any proposed tender or\nexchange offer, any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets, or any similar extraordinary transaction, to consider in addition to shareholder interests all\nrelevant factors, including, without limitation, the social, legal, and economic effects on our employees, customers and suppliers and our subsidiaries, on the communities and\ngeographical areas in which they operate. Our board of directors may also consider the amount of consideration being offered in relation to the then current market price for\noutstanding shares of capital stock and our then current value in a freely negotiated transaction. Our board of directors believes that these provisions are in our long-term best\ninterests and those of our shareholders.\nThe Company has sought to elect out of the provisions of Section 607.0901 of the FBCA, pertaining to affiliates transactions, and Section 607.0902 of the FBCA, pertaining to\ncontrol-share acquisitions.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Our Bylaws. Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential\nchange in control or change in our management, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our\nshareholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAmong other things, our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws:\n• provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of\npreferred stock, be filled by a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director;\n• provide that our Bylaws (other than any Bylaw that is adopted by our shareholders) can be amended by our board of directors.\nIn addition, our Bylaws provide for advance notice and related requirements in connection with shareholder proposals and nominations of directors by shareholders.\nShareholder proposals and nominations for directors at the annual meeting of shareholders must be received in writing not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to\nthe one-year anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. Shareholder proposals and nominations must also be in proper form which must include, among other things,\nthe name and address of the proposing shareholder and the number of shares directly or indirectly beneficially owned by such shareholder and information regarding the\nproposals or director nominees. The Bylaws also provide additional eligibility and other requirements for director nominees, requirements to call special meetings of the\nshareholders, and requirements to take shareholder action by written consent in lieu of a meeting.\nIndemnification Provisions\nFlorida law authorizes a Florida corporation to indemnify its directors and officers in certain instances against certain liabilities which they may incur by virtue of their\nrelationship with the corporation. Additionally, a Florida\ncorporation is authorized to provide further indemnification or advancement of expenses to any of its directors, officers, employees, or agents, except for acts or omissions that\nconstitute:\n• a violation of the criminal law unless the individual had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause to believe his or\nher conduct was unlawful,\n• a transaction in which the individual derived an improper personal benefit,\n• in the case of a director, a circumstance under which certain liability provisions of the FBCA are applicable related to payment of dividends or other\ndistributions or repurchases of shares in violation of the FBCA, or\n• willful or intentional misconduct or a conscious disregard for the best interests of the corporation in a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation to procure\na judgment in its favor or in a proceeding by or in the right of a corporation shareholder.\nA Florida corporation also is authorized to purchase and maintain liability insurance for its directors, officers, employees and agent, which we have done.\nOur Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our officers and directors for expenses, costs and liabilities actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any\naction, suit or proceeding in which an officer or director is made a party by reason of being or having been an officer or director of the Company except in relation to matters in\nwhich the officer or director shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duties as such officer\nor director. The indemnification rights provided in our Bylaws are not exclusive of any other rights to which our officers and directors may be entitled under any Bylaws,\nagreements, vote of shareholders or otherwise.\nWe are also a party to indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These agreements are made in recognition that our directors and executive\nofficers need substantial protection against personal liability and specific contractual assurance that the protection promised by the Bylaws will be available to them regardless\nof, among other things, any amendment thereto or revocation thereof, change in the composition of our board of directors, or business combination transaction.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling Alico pursuant to the foregoing\nprovisions and/or agreements, we have been informed that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and\nis therefore unenforceable.\n\nOapPpTroIOvaNl oAf GthRisE OEpMtiEoNn TA gFrOeeRm SeAntL aEt aA rNegDu lPaUrlyR CscHheAdSuEle Td HmIeSe tOinPgT oIOf tNhe A GGoRveErEnMor EaNndT C FaObRin eStA siLttEin Ag NasD t hPeU TRruCsHteAesS, Ea n(dth een \"dOinpgti o1n2 0A dgaryees mafetnert\" B) uisy mera'sd aep tphrios v_a/£l doaf yth oisf O-�ptti�onl ,Av g,2 r0ee2m3,e bnet t(w\"Oeepnt iAonL EI CxpOir,a ItNioCn .D, aa tFel\"o)r,i udna lceossr peoxrtaetniodne,d w bhyo osteh aedr dprreosvsi sisio In 0s 0o7f0 t hDisa nOipeltsio Inn tAergsrteaetem Ceonut.r It,f BSuuyi eer '2s0 f0u,n Fdts. iMn ytheers a, mFLou 3n3t 9o1f3 t haes p\"Surecllhears\"e a pnrdic teh e(a Bs OheAreRiDna fOteFr TdeRfUinSeTd EinE pSa OraFg rTaHphE 3 I.NAT.)E aRreN nAoLt a IvMaiPlaRbOleV bEyM thEeN OTp tTioRnU ESxTp iFraUtiNoDn DOaFte T tHheE p SeTri oAdT oEf eOxFe rFciLsOe oRfI DthAe o(\"pTtirouns tmeeasy\" )b, ew ehxotesen daeddd ruenstsi li ss uFclho rfiudna dDs ebpeacrotmmeen at voafi lEabnlvei,r onnomt teon etaxlc Pereodt e6c0ti odna,y Ds aivftiesrio tnh eo fO Spttaioten LEaxnpdisr,a t3io9n0 0D Catoem, bmyo wnwritetaelnth n Botlivcde. ,t oM Saeilll eSrt.a oItiffo tBnh ue1y 1seu5rr,'sv T efauyln lradehsqa uasirsreee edn, o iFtn l aopvraairdialaag b3ral2ep3 ha9 t96 t-.h 33e0.

(“Alico”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) (Nasdaq: ALCO) today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the highlights of which are as follows:\n\n  * **The Company previously announced that it entered a new three-year agreement to sell oranges to Tropicana at prices that are approximately 33% to 50% higher, over the life of the contract, than the average price for all the citrus fruit sold to Tropicana last season.**\n  * **The Company****has now treated substantially all of its producing trees with Oxytetracycline (“OTC”) and anticipates that these 4.5 million trees will support meaningful production growth in the 2024-25 harvest season.**\n  * **The Company previously announced that it has continued to commit to its real estate activities by hiring Mitch Hutchcraft, who joined Alico as Executive Vice President of Real Estate in May 2024.**\n  * **The Company's Board of Directors is announcing, as part of its succession plan, the anticipated appointment of a current Director, Adam Putnam, as the next Chairman of the Board when the current Chairman, George Brokaw, completes his term as Chairman in February 2025. Mr. Brokaw will continue to serve as a Director of Alico.**\n  * **The Company sold****798****acres of citrus land for approximately****$7.2 million** (**$9,000****per acre) and the buyer has an option within the next nine months to purchase the remaining 680 acres on that grove at the same price per acre.**\n  * **The Company maintains a strong balance sheet, with approximately****$94.8 million****available under lines of credit, a Working Capital Ratio of****2.67****to 1.00 and a Debt to Total Assets ratio of****0.20****to 1.00 at****June 30, 2024****, with no significant maturities until 2029.**\n\n\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n_(in thousands, except for per share amounts and percentages)_  \n---  \n**(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \n**Three Months Ended June 30,** | **Nine Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change** | **2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \nRevenue | $ | 13,610 | $ | 7,284 | 86.8 | % | $ | 45,708 | $ | 39,166 | 16.7 | %  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Alico, Inc. common stockholders | $ | (2,044 | ) | $ | 11,832 | (117.3 | )% | $ | 25,097 | $ | 895 | NM  \n(Loss) earnings per diluted common share | $ | (0.27 | ) | $ | 1.56 | (117.3 | )% | $ | 3.29 | $ | 0.12 | NM  \nEBITDA (1) | $ | 1,343 | $ | 18,789 | (92.9 | )% | $ | 48,686 | $ | 16,504 | 195.0 | %  \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) | $ | (3,390 | ) | $ | (1,286 | ) | (163.6 | )% | $ | (4,415 | ) | $ | (12,523 | ) | 64.7 | %  \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities | $ | 1,021 | $ | 6,492 | (84.3 | )% | $ | (18,720 | ) | $ | (618 | ) | NM  \n**June 30,****2024** | **September 30,2023** | **$ Change** |  **June 30,****2024** |  **September 30,****2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \n**Balance Sheet Items**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 9,106 | $ | 1,062 | $ | 8,044 | Working Capital Ratio | 2.67 to 1 | 3.90 to 1  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt | $ | 1,410 | $ | 2,566 | $ | (1,156 | ) | Debt to equity ratio | 0.20 to 1 | 0.30 to 1  \nLong-term debt, net | $ | 82,642 | $ | 101,410 | $ | (18,768 | ) | Net Debt (1) | $ | 74,946 | 127,636  \nLines of credit | $ | — | $ | 24,722 | $ | (24,722 | )  \nTotal Alico stockholders’ equity | $ | 269,489 | $ | 244,991 | $ | 24,498  \n(1) “EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Net Debt” are non-GAAP financial measures.

The decrease in our net income attributable to Alico common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was driven by Hurricane Ian insurance proceeds of $17.5 million received during the three months ended June 30, 2023 (the “Insurance Proceeds”), which were recorded as a reduction of operating expenses, partially offset by a gain of $4.4 million from the sale of citrus land in the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in our net income attributable to Alico common stockholders for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was driven by a gain of $74.9 million on the sale of the remaining 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch on December 21, 2023 and a gain of $4.4 million from the sale of citrus land on June 28, 2024, partially offset by inventory adjustments recorded at September 30, 2022 on the ending inventory balance, as a result of the impact of Hurricane Ian, which effectively lowered the inventory to be expensed in fiscal year 2023, $21.4 million of Insurance Proceeds, and a $9.4 million increase in the tax provision for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had a (loss) earnings of $(0.27) and $3.29 per diluted common share, respectively, compared to earnings of $1.56 and $0.12 per diluted common share for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had EBITDA of $1.3 million and $48.7 million, respectively, compared to $18.8 million and $16.5 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $(3.4) million and $(4.4) million, respectively, and $(1.3) million and $(12.5) million, respectively.\n\nThese quarterly financial results also reflect the seasonal nature of the Company’s business. The majority of the Company’s citrus crop is typically harvested in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year; consequently, most of the Company’s gross profit and cash flows from operating activities are recognized in those quarters. However, due to the timing of the current year harvest, more of the citrus crop was harvested in the first and second quarters of this fiscal year. Furthermore, the Company’s working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year.\n\n**Alico Citrus Division Results**\n\nCitrus production for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is summarized in the following table.\n\n_(in thousands, except per box and per pound solids data)_  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****June 30,** | **Change** |  **Nine Months Ended****June 30,** | **Change**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **Unit** | **%** | **2024** | **2023** | **Unit** | **%**  \n**Boxes Harvested:**  \nEarly and Mid-Season | — | — | — | — | 1,194 | 979 | 215 | 22.0 | %  \nValencias | 843 | 415 | 428 | 103.1 | % | 1,855 | 1,669 | 186 | 11.1 | %  \nTotal Processed | 843 | 415 | 428 | 103.1 | % | 3,049 | 2,648 | 401 | 15.1 | %  \nFresh Fruit | — | 1 | (1 | ) | (100.0 | )% | 35 | 41 | (6 | ) | (14.6 | )%  \nTotal | 843 | 416 | 427 | 102.6 | % | 3,084 | 2,689 | 395 | 14.7 | %  \n**Pound Solids Produced:**  \nEarly and Mid-Season | — | — | — | — | 5,364 | 4,586 | 778 | 17.0 | %  \nValencias | 4,294 | 2,142 | 2,152 | 100.5 | % | 9,365 | 8,702 | 663 | 7.6 | %  \nTotal | 4,294 | 2,142 | 2,152 | 100.5 | % | 14,729 | 13,288 | 1,441 | 10.8 | %  \n**Pound Solids per Box:**  \nEarly and Mid-Season | — | — | — | — | 4.49 | 4.68 | (0.19 | ) | (4.0 | )%  \nValencias | 5.09 | 5.16 | (0.07 | ) | (1.3 | )% | 5.05 | 5.21 | (0.16 | ) | (3.1 | )%  \n**Price per Pound Solids:**  \nEarly and Mid-Season | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | — | $ | 2.71 | $ | 2.61 | $ | 0.10 | 3.8 | %  \nValencias | $ | 2.84 | $ | 2.83 | $ | 0.01 | 0.3 | % | $ | 2.87 | $ | 2.76 | $ | 0.11 | 4.1 | %  \n  \nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, Alico Citrus harvested approximately 0.8 million and 3.1 million boxes of fruit, respectively, compared to 0.4 million and 2.7 million boxes of fruit in the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase in boxes harvested was driven by the timing of the harvest for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and as a result of our production beginning to recover to pre-hurricane levels during the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Early and Mid-Season and Valencia harvests are complete and for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 pound solids produced were up 17.0% and 7.6%, respectively, while pound solids per box were down 4.0% and 3.1%, respectively. Additionally, we realized an increase in the price per pound solids of 3.8% and 4.1%, respectively, in the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of more favorable pricing in one of our contracts with Tropicana.\n\nOur average realized/blended price per pound solids for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased 3.9%, as compared to the same period of the prior year. As a result of our signing of the new contract with Tropicana, the Company expects that our prices per pound solid will increase more significantly next year.\n\nWe expect it may take another season, or more, for the groves to fully recover to pre-Hurricane Ian production levels.\n\n**Land Management and Other Operations Division Results**\n\nLand Management and Other Operations includes lease income from grazing rights leases, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction rights to third parties, and other miscellaneous income.\n\nLand Management and Other Operations revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 decreased 34.8% and 10.6%, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year principally due to a decrease in hunting lease revenue as a result of the sale of the ranch land.\n\nThe 19.2% decrease in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in property taxes related to land sales. The 15.3% increase in operating expenses from Land Management and Other Operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in mining permitting costs.\n\n**Management Comment**\n\nJohn Kiernan, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\nI wanted to thank our investors who checked in over the weekend as Hurricane Debby approached the Florida coastline. Alico, and my fellow employees, had a wet weekend, and we expect rain to continue each day for the rest of the week, but we did not sustain any damage from Debby. Our thoughts are with all of our fellow Floridians who were impacted by this storm yesterday. Alico had been through dozens of storms over the past century, and we take every one seriously. Thank you again for your concern.\n\nDuring the past quarter, Alico finished harvesting the last fruit in our 2023-24 season. Fruit quality was poor at the beginning of both our Early-Mid and Valencia crop harvests but improved; however, the rate of fruit drop accelerated during both harvests. Lower levels of production for the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia harvests this season resulted in lower levels of pounds solid being sold, which has led to a total inventory write-down of $28.5 million in fiscal year 2024. We believe that the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia box production was affected by the continued impacts of Hurricane Ian. We managed our costs aggressively over the past year, but the lower revenue base was out of our control for the second year in a row.\n\nWe have several reasons to be more optimistic about our production next season. First, since 2017 Alico has planted 2.2 million trees, and nearly all of them are now producing fruit. Second, Alico began treating its citrus trees in January 2023 with an OTC product via trunk injection as a citrus greening therapy. In 2023, we were able to treat over 35% of our producing trees with OTC and in 2024, we treated approximately 4.5 million producing trees. Alico received $1.8 million of grant money from the Florida Citrus Research and Field Trial Foundation in January 2024 that covered substantially all of the costs of the 2023-24 harvest season OTC applications, and $1.1 million was received in June that will cover approximately 34% of the 2024-25 harvest season OTC applications. Although the small crop harvested this past season was not impressive, we believe that the continued recovery from Hurricane Ian was the most significant factor impacting fruit production and quality. We remain cautiously optimistic that being another year removed from the hurricane, along with the combination of a second round of injections for previously treated trees and a first round of injections for trees that were not treated in 2023, will show more significant improvements, not just in yield, but also in reduced fruit drop. In fact, in July it was reported that the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services approved a label change for the OTC product to remove the restriction that the product cannot be applied more than two years in a row. This change will enable us to apply the OTC treatment in calendar year 2025 to the trees that we started treating in 2023, which would be a relief to Alico and the Florida citrus industry overall. Third, as Alico’s production recovers next season, we will sell our fruit at higher prices. As we previously announced, the Company and Tropicana have extended our relationship for another 3 years. With our new contract to supply Tropicana with fruit, Alico will realize significantly higher prices per pound solid, which better reflect current market pricing, with price increases in the second and third years. This new contract covers production on approximately 65% of our acres. The remainder of our acres are covered by a contract with Tropicana, which expires at the end of the 2024-25 season but which also has higher pricing than the expiring contracts.\n\nAs the Atlantic hurricane season becomes more active over the next few months, Alico is prepared and focused on managing its world-class citrus operations, just as it has for more than 125 years. One of our greatest competitive advantages, as we face potential weather uncertainties, is our balance sheet liquidity. Our relationships with our lenders remain strong and we have approximately $94.8 million of undrawn capacity under a combination of a revolving line of credit, which matures in November 2029, and a working capital line of credit, which matures in November 2025, to provide ample liquidity as our trees continue to recover from Hurricane Ian. Our $70 million of term debt does not amortize, and is not due for repayment until 2029. We have steady access to workers and contractors, and our employee base is stable.\n\nOutside of our citrus operations, Alico continues to invest resources as it evaluates the long-term highest and best use of our real estate assets. To be clear, Alico will continue to conduct our regular citrus operations at nearly all of our groves for years to come. We will continue evaluating all of our properties to explore creative solutions to enhance and extract value. We seek to provide our investors with the benefits and stability of a conventional agriculture investment, with the optionality that comes with active land management. Last year, after evaluating the direct hit it took from Hurricane Ian in 2022, we made a difficult decision to transition our TRB grove in Charlotte County from proprietary citrus operations to a mix of third-party mining, vegetable and fruit crop leasing activities. This year, we evaluated another grove and have decided to also move beyond citrus there to realize its highest and best use. In 2022, Alico entered into a Purchase Option Agreement (“Option Agreement”) with a third party, E.R. Jahna Industries, Inc. (“Jahna”) for the sale of approximately 899 acres of land at a price of approximately $11,500 per acre on our 2x6 grove located in Hendry County, Florida, which expires in January 2025. It is expected that this Option Agreement will be exercised by the end of December 2024. It is understood that Jahna plans to conduct sand mining operations on the land once regulatory approval has been obtained, and Alico will have the right to lease back most of these acres, including 340 net citrus acres, for de minimis lease payments. In April 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell another approximately 798 acres of land at the 2x6 grove to a third party for approximately $7.2 million ($9,000 per acre), that includes an option to purchase another 680 acres within ten months from the closing date of the sale, at the same price per acre and Alico will continue to grow citrus on those 680 acres for the next harvest season. This previously announced transaction, which closed at the end of June 2024, illustrates our strategy of monetizing citrus groves on a case by case basis to redeploy capital to generate better returns for our shareholders.\n\nIn addition to our citrus operations, Alico has been pursuing a diversified real estate strategy since early 2022, which began with a comprehensive analysis of our land holdings portfolio. That process encouraged us to begin the entitlement process for our 4,500 acre grove in Collier County. In May, we recruited Mitch Hutchcraft to lead our Real Estate activities to accelerate the entitlement activities at Corkscrew, as well as develop a comprehensive analysis of highest and best use for remaining properties and create a roadmap to execute these strategic initiatives. Alico is continuing to evaluate every acre for its highest and best use, against its near-term potential for continued cash flow generation from our existing agricultural operations.\n\nI am also pleased to announce that, as part of our succession planning process, current board member Adam Putnam has been selected to be appointed Chairman of the Board of Alico following our next Annual General Meeting to be held in 2025. Adam will succeed George Brokaw, who has served as Chairman since February 2022 and as a Director since November 2013. George will continue to serve Alico as a Director of the Company.\n\nAdam has served on the Alico Board of Directors since August 2020 and has extensive knowledge and experience in the areas of agriculture, sustainability, government affairs, supply chain, business leadership and finance. Adam has served as the Chief Executive Officer of Ducks Unlimited, a U.S. nonprofit organization dedicated to the conservation of wetlands and associated upland habitats for waterfowl, other wildlife, and people since April 2019. Prior to joining Ducks Unlimited, he served as Florida’s Commissioner of Agriculture from 2011 until 2019, where he focused on fostering the growth of Florida agriculture and protecting the state’s water supply, among other issues, and was a U.S. Congressman for five terms, from 2001 until 2011, where he engaged on issues such as agriculture, water and energy. He also was the House Republican Conference Chair from 2007 until 2009. With his public policy and public service experience, Adam brings to the board expertise in understanding and navigating the physical and transition risks and opportunities of climate change, together with his knowledge of sustainability, water supply, and agricultural operations within Florida’s regulatory environment.\n\n**Other Corporate Financial Information**\n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee costs (as a result of lower bonus accruals), lower depreciation, lower legal costs (as a result of the voluntary dismissal of the shareholder lawsuit in the prior year), and lower accounting and insurance costs.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $0.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to lower depreciation, legal and insurance costs, partially offset by increased employee costs.\n\nOther Expense, net for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $2.5 million, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by gains of $4.4 million on the sale of 798 acres of citrus land during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to gains of $2.6 million on the sale of 548 acres of the Alico Ranch during the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nOther Expense, net for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased $75.2 million, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch to the State of Florida and the sale of 798 acres of citrus land during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. By comparison, for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 we recognized gains on sale of property and equipment of approximately $7.4 million relating to the sale of 1,436 acres, in the aggregate, from the Alico Ranch to several third parties.\n\n**Dividend**\n\nOn July 12, 2024, the Company paid a third quarter cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its outstanding common stock to stockholders of record as of June 28, 2024.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nThe Company continues to demonstrate financial strength within its balance sheet, as highlighted below:\n\n  * The Company’s working capital was $34.0 million at June 30, 2024, representing a 2.67 to 1:00 ratio.\n  * The Company maintains a solid debt to total assets ratio.

measurements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), Alico utilizes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Net Debt, which are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, to evaluate the performance of its business. Due to significant depreciable assets associated with the nature of our operations and, to a lesser extent, interest costs associated with our capital structure, management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Net Debt are important measures to evaluate our results of operations between periods on a more comparable basis and to help investors analyze underlying trends in our business, evaluate the performance of our business both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and the broader market, provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and operational strength of our business and help investors evaluate our ability to service our debt. Such measurements are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP information provided is unique to Alico and may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and adjustments for non-recurring transactions or transactions that are not indicative of our core operating results, such as gains or losses on sales of real estate, property and equipment and assets held for sale. Net Debt is defined as Current portion of long-term debt, Long-term debt, net and Lines of credit, less cash. The Company is not able to provide a quantitative reconciliation of its full-year 2024 guidance as to Net Debt to Current portion of long-term debt, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and has not provided forward-looking guidance for Current portion of long-term debt because of the uncertainty around certain items that may impact Current portion of long-term debt that are not within our control or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort.\n\n**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**\n\n_(in thousands)_ | **(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended****June 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended****June 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Alico, Inc. common stockholders | $ | (2,044 | ) | $ | 11,832 | $ | 25,097 | $ | 895  \nInterest expense, net | 533 | 1,196 | 2,551 | 3,618  \nIncome tax (benefit) provision | (861 | ) | 1,923 | 9,721 | 306  \nDepreciation, depletion and amortization | 3,715 | 3,838 | 11,317 | 11,685  \nEBITDA | 1,343 | 18,789 | 48,686 | 16,504  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments:  \nInventory net realizable value adjustment | — | — | 28,549 | 1,616  \nEmployee stock compensation expense (1) | 57 | 61 | 169 | 281  \nFederal relief - Hurricane Irma | — | (49 | ) | — | (1,315 | )  \nInsurance proceeds - Hurricane Ian | (299 | ) | (17,482 | ) | (299 | ) | (22,241 | )  \nGain on sale of property and equipment | (4,491 | ) | (2,605 | ) | (81,520 | ) | (7,368 | )  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | (3,390 | ) | $ | (1,286 | ) | $ | (4,415 | ) | $ | (12,523 | )  \n(1) Includes stock compensation expense for current executives, senior management and other employees.  \n  \n**Net Debt**\n\n_(in thousands)_ | **(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \n---|---|---  \n**June 30,****2024** |  **September 30,****2023**  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt | $ | 1,410 | $ | 2,566  \nLong-term debt, net | 82,642 | 101,410  \nLines of credit | — | 24,722  \nTotal Debt | 84,052 | 128,698  \nLess: Cash | (9,106 | ) | (1,062 | )  \nNet Debt | $ | 74,946 | $ | 127,636  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/2f3720bf-b16e-43b5-9deb-db09cf1e33f0/small/alico-inc-logo.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2f3720bf-b16e-43b5-9deb-db09cf1e33f0)\n\nSource: Alico, Inc. \n\nReleased August 5, 2024\n"
