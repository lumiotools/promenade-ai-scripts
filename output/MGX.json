(Nasdaq: MGX) (Metagenomi), a precision genetic medicines company committed to developing curative therapeutics for patients using its proprietary gene editing toolbox, today provided a business update and reported third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n“Our strong pace of innovation and execution continued in the third quarter, highlighted by the nomination of our first DC, MGX-001, intended as a one-time curative gene editing therapeutic for both adults and children with hemophilia A,” said Brian C. Thomas, PhD, CEO and founder of Metagenomi. “Supporting this DC nomination, we achieved successful proof-of-concept in NHPs, demonstrating site specific integration and durable Factor VIII activity levels through 12 months. This preclinical study provided an important validation of our gene editing platform, supporting our potential to overcome a key limitation of gene therapies that have struggled to achieve long term persistence of Factor VIII expression in patients. Pre-clinical data from our hemophilia A program has been accepted for oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December and we remain on track to file an IND for MGX-001 in 2026.”\n\n“Metagenomi’s collaboration with Ionis is progressing, with one to two planned DC nominations in 2025, focused on cardiometabolic development programs, where gene editing could represent a transformative option for patients. Our gene editing toolbox continues to differentiate on multiple fronts. We recently unveiled our novel ABE platform which we believe has superior targetability, precision and efficiency. Additionally, our ultra small SMART editing systems showed compatibility with single-AAV delivery, potentially unlocking novel _in vivo_ extrahepatic therapeutic development opportunities in the neuromuscular space.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Business Updates**\n\n**_Therapeutic Pipeline Updates_**\n\n  * Metagenomi continues to advance its wholly-owned lead program in hemophilia A, designed as a one-time curative treatment for both adults and children. \n    * Preclinical data utilizing a cynomolgus Factor VIII (FVIII) construct showed site-specific integration and durable FVIII activity levels in NHPs over 12 months and the study remains ongoing.\n    * Updated preclinical data has been accepted for an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 66th Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego in December.\n    * The company initiated manufacturing activities to support IND enabling studies, and MGX-001 remains on track for an IND filing in 2026.\n  * Building on the hemophilia A program, the company is advancing additional wholly-owned therapeutic candidates targeting secreted protein disorders, leveraging the MGX-001 editing system with the goal of achieving targeted and durable gene expression.\n  * All four therapeutic targets in the first wave of the company’s collaboration with Ionis are advancing in lead optimization. \n    * _In vivo_ rodent proof-of-concept was achieved in all four wave 1 genetic targets, including transthyretin (TTR) for transthyretin amyloidosis and angiotensinogen (AGT) for refractory hypertension as well as two undisclosed programs in significant cardiometabolic indications.\n    * The company remains on track to nominate one to two development candidates in 2025.\n\n\n\n**_Technology Platform Updates_**\n\n  * Using PAM interacting domain engineering, Metagenomi’s ABE platform is able to target over 95% of the human genome's base pairs, a significantly wider range of sites than first-generation SpCas9 base editors. The ABE achieved over 95% triplex protein knockdown at key gene targets in primary T cells. Genome-wide analyses confirmed no detectable translocations and no changes in stress-related gene expression post-editing.\n  * The company’s SMART platform includes genome editing systems that are small enough to be packaged into single AAV vectors even when additional effector domains are included for base editing. The company demonstrated 50-fold optimization of an ultra small base editing system using its proprietary metagenomics database and AI tools, potentially allowing for therapeutic levels of editing at targets in the neuromuscular space.\n\n\n\n**_Upcoming Events_** Metagenomi plans to participate in the following investor conferences during the fourth quarter of 2024:\n\n  * Jefferies London Healthcare Conference Corporate presentation on Thursday, November 21, 2024 at 1:30pm GMTA live webcast and replay will be available in the investor section of the company's website at https://ir.metagenomi.co/\n  * Piper Sandler 36th Annual Healthcare Conference, NYC Tuesday, December 3, 20241x1 investor meetings only\n\n\n\nMetagenomi plans to participate in the following scientific conferences during the fourth quarter of 2024:\n\n  * ASH 66th Annual Meeting and Exposition in San DiegoOral presentation “Site-Specific Insertion of Factor VIII Gene Results in Durable Factor VIII Expression in Nonhuman Primates”Monday, December 9, 2024, 5:30pm PT\n  * Nature conferences: RNA at the Bench and Bedside IV, The Salk Institute La Jolla December 11, 3:05pm PT\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale marketable securities were $274.6 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**R &D Expenses: **Research and development (R&D) expenses were $26.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $26.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**G &A Expenses: **General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**About Hemophilia A**\n\nHemophilia A is the most common X-linked inherited bleeding disorder, caused by a large variety of mutations in the FVIII gene leading to a loss of functional FVIII protein. Intracranial bleeding is of greatest concern as this can lead to major morbidity and mortality. Bleeding into joints leads to cumulative joint damage and is a major cause of morbidity. Diagnosis of severe disease typically occurs in infancy due to exaggerated bleeding in response to minor injury or routine medical procedures. Prevalence is estimated to be up to 26,500 patients in the US and more than 500,000 patients globally according to the World Federation of Hemophilia, with the vast majority of patients being male.\n\n**About Metagenomi**\n\nMetagenomi is a precision genetic medicines company committed to developing curative therapeutics for patients using its proprietary, comprehensive metagenomics-derived toolbox. Metagenomi is harnessing the power of metagenomics, the study of genetic material recovered from the natural environment, to unlock four billion years of microbial evolution to discover and develop a suite of novel editing tools capable of correcting any type of genetic mutation found anywhere in the genome. Its comprehensive genome editing toolbox includes programmable nucleases, base editors, and RNA and DNA-mediated integration systems (including prime editing systems and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat associated transposases). Metagenomi believes its diverse and modular toolbox positions the company to access the entire genome and select the optimal tool to unlock the full potential of genome editing for patients.

(Nasdaq: MGX), a precision genetic medicines company committed to developing curative therapeutics for patients using its proprietary gene editing toolbox, today presented a poster (P0533 Poster Session III) titled “[Efficient and specific genome editing with metagenomics-derived base editor for human therapeutic applications](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4Grj_m9jWdYcTREwx02YCMPdx4eCbO6H8rSs_ErN_CF6y2Oxq5ISPhdzUGZCcl9aQ7NSnjRPRaP-K5lc2nULB6aP1gpbQ1QcE8yFPNIn_W53c_6rRYJUNZzTwsT_LToWH0YyBWKcvGUcYzXZ7skGqRihH7U1ToPo3klyoSRKtmKlSEKSU79EVECjeAQ0cRbsYuWWcXv0flBUF6ksWv-RZY0flbEeYF5qk-5lUoKN246-PeXWpuqnt12N0o7HwyOp)” at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 31st Annual Congress in Rome, Italy.\n\n“Base editors are powerful gene editing tools that are able to modify genes through single nucleotide changes, including multiplexed gene editing applications without risk of translocations. Our ABEs display critical attributes necessary for successful multiplexed gene editing with remarkable targetability, efficiency, precision and tolerability,” said Brian C. Thomas, PhD, CEO and founder of Metagenomi. “We remain focused on advancing our base editors for _in vivo_ genome editing programs, while pursuing partnerships to advance _ex vivo_ cell therapy applications.”\n\nToday’s poster presentation described the following key advantages of the Metagenomi ABE platform:\n\n**Targetability:** Metagenomi’s ABE is targetable to over 95% of the human genome's base pairs, a significantly wider range of sites than first-generation SpCas9 base editors. This expanded scope provides unparalleled flexibility in addressing complex gene target locations.\n\n**Efficiency:** The ABE platform achieved over 95% reproducible and durable triplex protein knockdown in primary T-cells, confirming its highly efficient application for multiplex gene editing. This platform is also compatible with various non-viral methods of site-specific template-integration in a simultaneous step, including CAR, engineered TCR, and/or regulatory genes leveraging a Metagenomi nuclease. This enables a potent all-in-one editing solution for the development of next-generation cell therapies.\n\n**Specificity:** The ABE demonstrated highly specific on-target deamination with minimum-to-no indel formation. Genome-wide analyses confirmed no detectable translocations and no significant genomic composition differences when compared to unedited cells. This precision minimizes the risk of unintended genetic alterations, positioning the company’s ABE for long-term therapeutic applications.\n\n**Tolerability:** Metagenomi’s ABE triplex protein knockdowns exhibited excellent tolerability in cells, with no adverse effects on cell viability, expansion, or changes in stress-related gene expression observed post-editing. Tolerability is especially critical in multiplex editing of primary T-cells, where maintaining cell health is vital for therapeutic efficacy.\n\n**About Metagenomi** Metagenomi is a precision genetic medicines company committed to developing curative therapeutics for patients using its proprietary, comprehensive metagenomics-derived toolbox.
