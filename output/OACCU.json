After being – incorrectly – priced in multiple times over the past year, the first interest rate cut finally came in September, marking the end of the Fed’s hiking cycle. As we discuss below in _Credit Markets: Key Trends, Risks, and Opportunities to Monitor in 4Q2024_ , this may unlock new M&A and LBO activity, generating more loan supply for the public debt and direct lending markets, both of which are hungry for new-money issuance. While the leveraged finance markets continue to readily absorb newly issued corporate loans, one less familiar area of the credit markets – asset-backed finance – faces a potential financing void. \n\nAlternative capital providers supplanting traditional lenders is now a familiar tale. Banks, facing heightened capital regulations following the Global Financial Crisis, retrenched from corporate lending, effectively launching direct lending as a mainstream asset class. As traditional lenders face further headwinds, **we believe the next chapter in the private credit story is the migration of asset-backed finance (ABF) toward alternative capital providers**. While the asset class isn’t new – lending against contractual revenue streams has historically been a cornerstone of bank and insurance company activity – the fundamental transition lies in who now provides the capital. Asset-backed financing may become increasingly unfavorable for banks, and insurers generally stick to the investment grade corner of the ABF market. Even among private lenders, who are estimated to currently provide less than 5% of asset-back financing within the $5.5 trillion universe, there are still significant barriers to entry, with a complexity that mandates experience across corporate lending, real estate lending, and structured credit. (See Figure 1.)\n\nFigure 1: Private Credit Involvement in ABF Is Nascent\n\n![figure 1](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-1.jpg?sfvrsn=99955466_7)\n\nSource: Oliver Wyman estimate1\n\n**Defining Asset-Backed Finance**\n\n _A form of private credit, backed by pools of contractual assets (e.g., loans, leases, and mortgages), as opposed to individual companies.__Unlike standard corporate lending, ABF pays back principal continuously, rather than providing a large principal repayment at maturity.__Underlying assets in the ABF universe reflect the breadth of the global economy, ranging from aircraft leases to credit card receivables to music royalties._\n\nThe Regulatory Squeeze\n\nOngoing efforts to reduce the systemic risk presented by banking institutions have manifested in a succession of regulatory changes. One of the most impactful facets of these regulations is the requirement for banks to hold more capital, which may improve bank liquidity levels but also reduce their return on equity. (See Figure 2.) Because this capital is measured as a percentage of the bank’s assets (i.e., outstanding loans), activity that grows the asset side of the equation increasingly necessitates careful consideration. Importantly, asset base is calculated on a risk-weighted basis, meaning **riskier lending activities, such as loans to small businesses or against repayments from individual borrowers, require banks to hold more capital**. \n\nFigure 2: The Average Capital Requirements for Large U.S. Banks Have Steadily Increased\n\n![figure 2](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-2.png?sfvrsn=f2955466_1)\n\nSource: The Federal Reserve2\n\nThe implementation of these new regulations, primarily enacted via the Basel III accords, has steadily progressed since the Global Financial Crisis but is imminently coming to a head in the form of the Basel III endgame. This refers to the culmination of the Basel III rules, with a 2025 compliance date for large U.S. banks, followed by a three-year transition period. The most stringent rules would fall on the largest, and therefore most systemically important, banks: the 37 largest banks in the U.S. would meet the proposed $100 billion asset threshold, representing over 75% of all bank assets in the country.3\n\nAlong with higher capital requirements, the Basel III endgame will constrain the usage of internal bank models for calculating risk-weighted assets, with a standardized model effectively able to overrule internal outputs. Unrated assets – common within the ABF universe – face a 100% risk weighting regardless of their true risk,4 requiring banks to hold an outsized amount of capital, thus potentially rendering this lending unfavorable for banks. \n\nAdditional Headwinds\n\nIncreases to regulatory capital only add to the pressure on banks from quantitative tightening and a string of sector-specific stresses, including the decline of brick-and mortar retailers and an increase in vacant office buildings. \n\nOne challenge new to bank lenders has been the unreliability of deposits. (See Figure 3.) While bank loans often have long maturities, deposits can be withdrawn almost immediately. This isn’t a worry for private credit lenders, who offer their investors only limited liquidity in order to ensure stable capital. Based on the practice of fractional reserve banking – in which banks retain a portion of customer deposits as reserves and lend the rest – a reduction in deposits is naturally followed by a reduction in lending activity. \n\nThe 2023 regional banking crisis highlights the liquidity risk inherent in this model. The deposits held by Silicon Valley Bank, the headline casualty, were lent out via long duration bonds, which decreased in value as interest rates rose. When customers sought to withdraw their deposits, this asset-liability mismatch was ultimately fatal for the bank. Given this instability, banks have become more measured when providing the illiquid financing associated with ABF. \n\nFigure 3: Deposit Instability Has Made Bank Lending More Challenging in Recent Years\n\n![figure 3](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-3.png?sfvrsn=af975466_1)\n\nSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.)\n\nBank Reprioritization\n\nThe upshot of this? **Banks find certain lending activities increasingly inefficient, with no end in sight to this shift.** As a result of tougher capital charges, banks are either (a) refocusing lending activity on their biggest (and safest) client base or (b) targeting lending toward situations where they stand to earn fees and attract deposits. Lending is estimated to have accounted for only 21% of banks’ total revenue in 2023, down from 26% in 2019.5 In the U.S., bank lending as a percentage of GDP has dropped by nearly ten percentage points since the Global Financial Crisis. (See Figure 4.) \n\nFigure 4: Bank Provision of Credit Has Declined as a Percentage of U.S. GDP\n\n![figure 4](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-4.png?sfvrsn=bc975466_1)\n\nSource: The World Bank\n\nA Financing Void\n\nAs banks continue to shift their focus, what does this mean for alternative lenders? **It’s important to note that alternative lenders currently play a smaller role in ABF than in mainstream direct corporate lending.** Banks started to retreat from corporate direct lending quite some time ago, and direct lending presented a more natural extension for leveraged finance practitioners, who flocked to the space. Many companies now issue both public senior loans and private loans, with the due diligence processes for these types of loans having a high degree of overlap. Direct lenders continue to dominate the private debt landscape, with nearly $200bn of combined dry powder to deploy.6 On the other hand, ABF represents a new frontier for most managers, with additional barriers to entry. (See Figure 5.)\n\nFigure 5: Private Credit Capital Has Grown Substantially but Remains Tilted Toward Mainstream Direct Lending\n\n![figure 5](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-5.png?sfvrsn=8b975466_1)\n\nSource: Preqin\n\n**We believe the most underserved portion of the ABF universe is the ‘‘core’’ segment that sits between senior, investment grade lending and the opportunistic end of the risk spectrum.** The investment grade portion of ABF, with the lowest perceived risk and lowest expected returns, is well addressed by insurance buyers and other investment grade-focused ABF platforms. U.S. insurers hold a whopping $8.5 trillion7 in total cash and invested assets; they value the cash flows generated by ABF, but regulation demands an investment grade rating to ensure favorable capital treatment. For most ABF packages, investment grade ratings only extend to senior financing, therefore leaving mezzanine and junior capital financing to other parties. Additionally, many transactions don’t support ratings at all (e.g., short-term facilities, which are incompatible with rating agency criteria). In short, insurance capital won’t be able to fill the void left by retreating banks. \n\nMeanwhile, private equity, opportunistic credit investors, and specialty finance platforms require higher returns than those generally offered by the core portion of ABF. As a result, we anticipate alternative lenders will increasingly provide essential capital in the core ABF segment where traditional senior lenders, such as insurers and banks, are unable or unwilling to operate. \n\nABF Sector Spotlight\n\nAmong the wide range of esoteric ABF verticals, we’ve chosen to showcase three sectors we believe may be at the center of the ABF evolution. \n\n**(1) Aircraft Leasing: Fleeting Supply**\n\nSince 2019, aircraft production has significantly declined, largely due to delays and quality control issues at major manufacturers like Boeing, Airbus, and Pratt & Whitney. (See Figure 6.) This has led to unprecedented order backlogs and higher aircraft lease rates.\n\nGlobal airline traffic has now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, and aircraft producers have been unable to meet the increased demand. Due to the extremely limited supply of new planes, airlines have no choice but to put aside idealized fleet planning and prioritize leasing and purchasing midlife assets.\n\nWe believe the current supply-demand imbalance, which is expected to persist until 2030 or beyond, presents a rare opportunity for appropriately resourced aircraft investors to step in and provide financing to proven aircraft leasing platforms and originators. \n\nFigure 6: 2024 Aircraft Deliveries Are Likely to Remain Below 2017 Levels\n\n![figure 6](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-6.png?sfvrsn=e1975466_1)\n\nSource: AerCap, as of May 2024\n\nNote: Represents narrowbody aircraft (i.e., single-aisle airliners)\n\n**(2) Synthetic Risk Transfer (SRT): Coming to America**\n\nSynthetic risk transfer (i.e., when a bank enters into a contract with an investor, whereby the investor assumes the risk of any future losses in a credit pool in exchange for coupon income) allows banks to “sell” risk without taking the immediate balance sheet impact of a below-par sale. Many banks lent aggressively at the historically low rates from 2009-21 and now find themselves with a balance sheet full of low-interest, long-duration assets.\n\nSelling these assets in today’s elevated interest rate environment would create a book equity loss, potentially impacting capital ratios and market perception, as well as endangering the bank’s relationship with the underlying borrowers. Banks are increasingly using SRT as a tool to effectively amortize the “cost” of that sale over several years. \n\nIn 2023, SRT issuance in Europe was over ten times the volume in the U.S.8 It is estimated that the U.S. market will quickly begin to catch up, with a fourfold increase projected for 2024. (See Figure 7.) Moreover, we believe the most attractive SRT opportunities will be those associated with pools of niche assets that require specialized knowledge, avoiding the overly competitive auctions associated with ‘‘vanilla’’ SRT, such as corporate loans or subscription facilities.\n\nFigure 7: SRT Volume Is Projected to Grow Substantially in the U.S.\n\n![figure 7](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-7.png?sfvrsn=27965466_1)\n\nSource: Bank of America estimates, as of March 2024\n\n**(3) Consumer Credit: Lender Exodus**\n\nThe unsecured consumer sector underwent a negative performance shock in 2022-23 after experiencing two years of robust performance, rapid origination growth, and inexpensive funding. This downturn was driven by inflated credit scores, machine learning models misled by pandemic-related stimulus measures, and high inflation. Subsequent to this volatility, many capital providers have exited this space entirely. \n\nDue to the deterioration in performance, originators have tightened their credit underwriting standards and increased Annual Percentage Rates, which has created a more favorable outlook for new investments as performance begins to improve.\n\nIn the unsecured consumer sector, we’ve seen loans originated through personal interaction (e.g., in-branch, at medical offices, or at point of sale) perform significantly better than those originated online or without personal interaction. Therefore, we believe investors, when looking to provide financing to thoughtful consumer lenders or purchase discounted pools of consumer loans, should favor loans originated through personal interaction and used to finance essential spending. \n\nWhat Next?\n\nWe believe we’re witnessing a permanent, secular shift in the financing ecosystem, as ABF transforms from an asset class dominated by banks and insurers into an investible alternative credit opportunity. We don’t expect banks to meaningfully loosen credit standards and regain their lost market share in the near future, and we expect insurers to maintain their focus on lower-returning, investment grade lending. **Thus, we believe asset-backed finance isn’t a short-term opportunity, but rather the next frontier of private credit.**\n\nHowever, ABF shouldn’t be viewed as a homogenous, easily accessible asset class. While we believe experienced managers can control risk, we believe those who don’t appreciate the complexity of the asset class – or who fail to conduct adequate due diligence – are at risk of getting burnt. \n\nCredit Markets: Key Trends, Risks, and Opportunities to Monitor in 4Q2024\n\n**(1) The Trajectory for Interest Rates in the U.S. Remains Unclear Despite the First Cut**\n\nIn September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 bps, bringing the federal funds rate to the new target range of 4.75-5.00%. This ended the interest rate hiking cycle that began in March 2022 and resulted in a 525 bps rise over the period. Given the September rate cut was largely priced in by market participants, the impact on Treasury yields was limited. \n\nThe Fed’s action was long awaited after a series of ‘‘false starts’’ to the rate cutting cycle, whereby many market participants priced in aggressive interest rate cuts that then didn’t materialize. (See Figure 8.) Credit investors seeking to drive performance through duration exposure were left frustrated, while the best returns were often achieved through high-income assets with limited interest rate sensitivity, including senior loans and structured credit. \n\nFigure 8: The Actual Fed Funds Rate in 2024 Has Diverged from the Market Prediction at the Start of the Year \n\n![figure 8](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-8.png?sfvrsn=7965466_2)\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nThis significant cut was followed by exceptional U.S. jobs data at the start of October. Total nonfarm payroll employment in September increased by more than 250,000 jobs, well above the consensus expectation of roughly 140,000 jobs.9 This apparent affirmation of the resilience of the U.S. labor market, and subsequent increase in uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of interest rates, led to a rise in Treasury yields. \n\nFor those that bet heavily on aggressive interest rate cuts, this proved to be another tough pill to swallow. As Howard Marks often reminds us, investors should always be conscious of where we are in the market cycle – but never make bets based on macroeconomic predictions. \n\n**(2) Favorable Conditions May Support a Rise in M &A and LBO Volume**\n\nPrimary leveraged finance markets experienced a meaningful surge late in the third quarter of 2024, following the usual summer lull: senior loan and high yield bond issuance was robust in September, with over $140 billion of combined volume, a 70% increase from the same period in 2023.10\n\nDebt issuance over the last two years has been dominated by refinancings as private equity sponsors have found limited exit opportunities for their portfolio companies. The headwinds to LBO and M&A activity are well known: elevated financing costs after a historic rise in interest rates, stubbornly high equity valuations, concerns about economic growth, and, in more recent months, the uncertainty around the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. \n\nSome of these challenges now seem to be abating. While interest rates will likely remain elevated, the first interest rate cut from the Fed in September marked the end of the hiking cycle. At the same time, the economic outlook (especially in the U.S.) appears more robust, with strong labor market data and a surprisingly resilient consumer. Another catalyst is limited partners pressing their investment managers for cash: distributions from closed-end funds have been delayed, with the median hold period for exited private equity portfolio companies recently exceeding seven years, leaving LPs pushing for exits.11\n\nWith this, we’re beginning to see signs of life in the M&A and LBO space. Importantly, the third quarter of 2024 saw the highest amount of non-refinancing loan issuance since 1Q2022. (See Figure 9.) Moreover, more LBOs were funded through the broadly syndicated loan market than through direct lending during the period.12 This shift was largely due to significant investor demand, particularly from CLOs, which has reduced the cost of financing in the public market. We anticipate that once the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election is removed, a new wave of M&A and LBO activity could emerge. \n\nFigure 9: New Loan Supply Is Showing Signs of Recovery\n\n![figure 9](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-9.png?sfvrsn=33965466_1)\n\nSource: PitchBook LCD\n\n**(3) Private Debt Defaults Remain Limited, But Pay Attention to PIK**\n\nPerformance in the private debt markets has remained strong in 2024, with business development companies (BDCs) returning an exceptional 10.7% year-to-date.13 While we’ve seen an uptick in defaults this year, the current default rate of 2.0% remains manageable, and below the default rate in the broadly syndicated loan market.14\n\nWhat has kept private debt markets so buoyant? Firstly, companies have been supported by surprisingly resilient consumer expenditure. Secondly, sponsors have proactively reduced costs in their portfolio companies and passed on input price increases to end consumers. These sponsors have also collaborated with lenders to promptly address potential liquidity issues. \n\nHowever, there are still several reasons for lenders to exercise caution. Issuers of floating-rate debt are likely to be exposed to higher borrowing costs for longer than they’d previously anticipated, as the market consensus around the trajectory for interest rate cuts has proven to be overly ambitious. This may put further pressure on interest coverage, particularly given that we’ve seen slowing EBITDA growth among middle-market companies. \n\nAs borrowers begin to feel the impact of these mounting pressures, we’ve observed a shift toward alternative financing solutions. The most prominent is the rise in borrowers turning to payment-in-kind (PIK) instead of making their coupon payments in cash. For example, the percentage of PIK income for BDCs has risen by nearly 200 bps since 2023. (See Figure 10.) This can alleviate liquidity pressure on borrowers, but it presents a risk for lenders who (a) miss out on regular cash payments and (b) face uncertainty regarding delivery of accrued interest or potential equity upside. While not all PIK is inherently bad, it remains crucial for managers to diligently monitor these developments. \n\nFigure 10: PIK Constitutes an Increasing Percentage of Private Credit Income\n\n![figure 10](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-10.png?sfvrsn=79965466_1)\n\nSource: Fitch Ratings\n\n#### Assessing Relative Value\n\nPerformance of Select Indices\n\n![final performance](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_performance.png?sfvrsn=17955466_1)\n\nAs of September 30, 2024\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Credit Suisse, ICE BofA, JP Morgan, S&P Global, Thomson Reuters15\n\nDefault Rates by Asset Class\n\n![final performance](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_default-rate.png?sfvrsn=a0955466_1)\n\nSource: JP Morgan for high yield bonds; Credit Suisse for loans through 2Q2023, UBS since 3Q2023; Bank of America for Global Convertibles\n\nNote: Data represents the trailing-12-month default rate; excludes distressed exchanges\n\n#### Strategy Focus\n\nHigh Yield Bonds\n\n**Market Conditions: 3Q2024 **\n\n**U.S. High Yield Bonds –** Return: 5.3%16 | LTM Default Rate: 1.6%17\n\n  * **Yield spreads contracted moderately in 3Q2024:** At quarter-end, yield spreads remained near the low end of the historically normal range of 300–500 bps.18\n\n  * **Yields in the asset class remain elevated:** They decreased slightly in 3Q2024 but remain above the ten-year median.

The outperformance of CCC-rated bonds derived partly from gains in the satellite and telecom sectors. \n\n\n\n\n**European High Yield Bonds –** Return: 3.8%20 | LTM Default Rate: 1.4%21\n\n  * **The asset class strengthened modestly in 3Q2024:** Returns were largely driven by coupon income and price appreciation. \n\n  * **The lowest-quality segment of the market outperformed:** CCC-rated bonds returned 5.7% for the period, compared to 3.9% and 3.3% for B-rated and BB-rated bonds, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n### Opportunities\n\n  * **High yield bonds are priced at a discount to par:** Investors have the opportunity to earn capital appreciation, along with elevated coupon income. \n\n  * **The high yield bond market continues to offer attractive yields:** While spreads have narrowed slightly, yields remain elevated, providing investors with the opportunity to earn attractive contractual returns. \n\n  * **Default risk remains low:** Quality in the asset class is high: BB-rated bonds make up more than half of the market in the U.S. Meanwhile, maturities through 2026 have declined considerably over the last year. \n\n\n\n\n### Risks\n\n  * **There is significant uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. presidential election:** Policy changes could quickly impact corporate taxes, the budget deficit, and U.S. national debt. \n\n  * **Elevated inflation and high labor costs may impair issuers’ fundamentals:** While inflation has slowed, many input costs remain high. \n\n  * **Heightened geopolitical risk may put pressure on economic growth:** Geopolitical tensions, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and complicated China/U.S. relations, could potentially lead to volatility within the global supply chain. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: The High Yield Bond Markets Still Offer Attractive Yields\n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-11.png?sfvrsn=58965466_1)\n\nSource: ICE BofA US High Yield Constrained Index and ICE BofA Global Non-Financial High Yield European Issuer, Excluding Russia Index, as of September 30, 2024\n\nSenior Loans\n\n**Market Conditions: 3Q2024 **\n\n**U.S. Senior Loans –** Return: 2.1%22 | LTM Default Rate: 1.3% \n\n  * **U.S. senior loan prices increased in 3Q2024:** Positive performance was supported by high coupon income and continued demand from CLO issuance. \n\n  * **Gross issuance in the asset class remained strong:** Loan primary market activity continued at a steady pace in the third quarter, bringing issuance for the year above $900bn, which is already the highest volume seen since 2017. But refinancings/repricings have continued to dominate issuance. \n\n\n\n\n**European Senior Loans –** Return: 2.0%23 | LTM Default Rate: 1.6% \n\n  * **European loans generated a positive return during the third quarter:** Strong coupon income continued to drive returns as prices remained relatively flat during the period. \n\n  * **Lower-quality loans outperformed:** CCC-rated loans, the lowest-quality portion of the senior loan market, returned 4.9% in the period, while B- and BB-rated loans returned 1.7% and 2.0%, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n### Opportunities\n\n  * **High coupons could continue to attract investors:** Unless there is a substantial decline in reference rates, floating-rate loans will likely remain compelling throughout the remainder of 2024. \n\n  * **The default outlook appears manageable:** Default rates in the U.S. and European loan markets are projected to rise but are likely to stay below their non-recessionary averages. (See Figure 12.) This is primarily because of the limited volume of maturities in the next two years and the availability of other sources of capital (e.g., rescue financings). \n\n  * **Loans may experience less volatility than other asset classes because of loans’ stable buyer base:** CLOs, the primary holders of leveraged loans, have limited selling pressure, and the asset class tends to attract long-term institutional investors because of the lengthy cash settlement period. \n\n\n\n\n### Risks\n\n  * **Recovery rates are well below the historical average:** The increased prevalence of loan-only capital structures has caused average recovery rates in the asset class to decline to 42%.24 We expect this trend to continue through this default cycle. \n\n  * **Declining interest rates may reduce appetite for floating-rate assets:** While interest rates remain above their ten-year average, additional interest rate cuts could have a negative impact on demand for floating-rate assets. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Default Rates Are Still Below the Historical Non-Recessionary Average\n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-12.png?sfvrsn=ae965466_1)\n\nSource: J.P. Morgan, as of September 30, 202425\n\nInvestment Grade Credit\n\n**Market Conditions: 3Q2024 **\n\nReturn: 5.8%26\n\n  * **Investment grade debt generated positive returns in 3Q2024:** This was largely driven by the decline in Treasury yields, as the U.S. Federal Reserve commenced its interest rate cutting cycle. \n\n  * **Higher-quality credit outperformed:** AAA-rated corporate bonds outperformed the lowest-rated segment of the investment grade market by over 60 bps in the third quarter. This was primarily because the higher-rated segment has the longest average duration within the asset class. \n\n  * **Issuance remained robust during the quarter:** Gross issuance of investment grade bonds in the period totaled $428bn, bringing year-to-date issuance to more than $1.3tn.27 Demand for investment grade credit remained more than sufficient to absorb the surge in supply; the primary market currently has an average oversubscription rate of 3.7x. \n\n\n\n\n### Opportunities\n\n  * **Investment grade corporate debt yields are still elevated:** Yields in the asset class ended the quarter at 4.8%, which is meaningfully higher than the five-year average. (See Figure 13.) \n\n  * **Investment grade debt may benefit if economic activity slows:** The asset class has a higher average credit rating and duration than high yield bonds, and so may outperform if risk sentiment declines, yield spreads widen, and interest rates fall. \n\n\n\n\n### Risks\n\n  * **Fixed-rate asset classes may suffer if interest rates don’t decrease as much as currently anticipated:** At quarter-end, market participants were projecting two to three additional cuts in the remainder of 2024, and five more in 2025. If the Fed takes a more patient approach, there will likely be volatility in many of the more rate-sensitive credit markets.28\n\n  * **If interest rates decline substantially, there could be reduced demand for low-yielding fixed income securities:** Investors that need to achieve a particular yield may gravitate from investment grade credit toward asset classes offering higher yields. However, the flipside of this dynamic is the potential for inflows from money market investors; this may be significant given money markets have risen to $6.4tn in volume.29\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Investment Grade Bond Yields Remain Well Above the Five-Year Average \n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-13.png?sfvrsn=9c965466_1)\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nEmerging Markets Debt\n\n**Market Conditions: 3Q2024 **\n\n**EM Corporate High Yield Bonds –** Return: 4.6%30\n\n  * **EM high yield corporate debt recorded a positive return for the eighth consecutive quarter:** Following this strong performance, the EM index now offers a yield below 8% for the first time since the U.S. Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in early 2022. The spread premium versus U.S. high yield is near the historical average; however, spreads in the asset class are currently around the tightest they’ve been in six years. \n\n  * **Global policy has been supportive:** In September, the Fed reduced interest rates for the first time in over four years, developed market economic data was resilient, and China announced a wave of new stimulus measures, which boosted investor sentiment regarding global growth. \n\n  * **Declining interest rates contributed to a surge in bond issuance:** EM companies issued $64 billion of new bonds in September, the highest volume since June 2021. Despite moderate EM debt fund outflows, there was ample investor appetite for issuance, including debt issued by debut and lower-rated companies. (See Figure 14.) \n\n  * **Political risks relating to Latin America and the U.S. election are lurking:** Central banks in Latin America have kept real interest rates high (i.e., Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia are all above 5%), largely due to regional currency weaknesses and ongoing domestic challenges. The uncertainty around the U.S. election has affected investment in many emerging markets, given its potential impact on critical global policies, including trade tariffs and U.S./China relations. \n\n\n\n\n### Opportunities\n\n  * **The investable universe is expanding:** Improved financing conditions have supported additional debt-financed transactions, including M&A activity and the emergence of new borrowers. \n\n  * **Even with the recent rally, there are attractive opportunities across the diverse regions and industries within EM:** These various segments of EM are at different stages in the credit cycle and exposed to idiosyncratic risks. \n\n  * **The EM default outlook is moderate:** The EM default rate is below 3% year-to-date, representing a decline from the high levels recorded in recent years. \n\n\n\n\n### Risks\n\n  * **Market stability may have increased investor complacency:** A surge in EM issuance, including of lower-quality bonds, may suggest complacency following a relatively calm period across key markets. \n\n  * **A global economic slowdown could put pressure on EM export-driven economies:** Unresolved factors, including the impact of Chinese economic stimulus and the outcome of U.S. elections, could reshape global trade dynamics. \n\n  * **Geopolitical tensions may have negative long-term effects on EM debt capital flows:** Investor confidence in EM credit could decline if ongoing conflicts escalate or if China/U.S. relations worsen. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: EM Corporate Bond Issuance in Many Regions Has Meaningfully Recovered \n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-14.png?sfvrsn=e3965466_1)\n\nSource: JP Morgan, as of October 11, 2024\n\nGlobal Convertibles\n\n**Market Conditions: 3Q2024 **\n\nReturn: 5.8%31 | LTM Default Rate: 3.5%32\n\n  * **Convertible bond prices increased in the third quarter upon strong equity market performance:** Stocks in Asia ex-Japan and the United States generated the largest gains, primarily due to (a) several new stimulus measures recently announced by policymakers in China and (b) the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 50-bps interest rate cut. As a result, small-cap shares, as well as other equities that previously struggled in the face of higher interest rates, outperformed during the period. \n\n  * **Primary market activity remained healthy:** New issuance of global convertibles totaled $21.9bn across 42 new deals in 3Q2024. The majority of issuance was concentrated in the U.S. and Asia ex-Japan, and primarily within the technology and financial sectors. \n\n\n\n\n### Opportunities\n\n  * **The size and quality of the convertible bond market has continued to improve:** In an elevated interest rate environment, companies seeking new capital or those looking to refinance straight debt have increasingly turned to the convertibles market, where coupons are lower. Thus far in 2024, new issuance of global convertible bonds is running at the fastest pace since 2021. (See Figure 15.) Importantly, nearly 70% of the volume this year has come from companies with large equity market capitalizations.33\n\n  * **The equity rally is expanding:** The rally in U.S. equity markets – which was primarily concentrated among a handful of large technology companies (i.e., the “Magnificent Seven”) – broadened in the third quarter, with over 60% of S&P 500 companies outperforming the index, compared to around 25% in the first half of the year.34\n\n\n\n\n### Risks\n\n  * **Numerous trends threaten to slow global economic growth and weigh on equity prices:** These include concerns about sticky inflation, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election, and heightened geopolitical risk. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: New Issuance of Global Convertibles Has Been Running at the Fastest Pace Since 2021\n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-15.png?sfvrsn=f9965466_2)\n\nSource: BofA Global Research\n\nStructured Credit\n\n**Market Conditions: 3Q2024 **\n\n**Corporate –** BB-Rated CLO Return: 2.7%35 | BBB-Rated CLO Return: 2.3%36\n\n  * **Collateralized Loan Obligation spreads have tightened but still offer a premium over equivalent corporate bonds:** BBB-rated CLO spreads tightened to 358 bps at the end of 3Q2024, but this still represents an attractive premium over BBB-rated corporate bonds. \n\n  * **Activity in the primary market decelerated in 3Q2024 but remains robust:** CLO issuance recorded its weakest quarter of the year but remains meaningfully above the level of the same period in 2023. Issuance of CLOs in the U.S. exceeded $41bn in the period, up from $23bn in 3Q2023. Issuance in Europe totaled €11bn compared to €8bn in 3Q2023.37\n\n\n\n\n**Real Estate –** BBB-Rated CMBS Return: 4.6%38\n\n  * **Real estate structured credit recorded positive performance in 3Q2024:** The asset class continues to benefit from improving investor sentiment around the real estate sector, which has been largely driven by expectations of further interest rate cuts over the next year. \n\n  * **Valuations in the CRE market varied by sector:** Green Street’s Commercial Property Price Index39 increased by 1.6% quarter-over-quarter but decreased by 3.1% year-over-year.40 The office subsector index declined by 8.2% YoY.41 While most sectors experienced annual declines in the low single digits, many increased modestly on a quarterly basis, suggesting that the market may be stabilizing. \n\n  * **Primary market activity continues to accelerate meaningfully:** CMBS issuance in 2024 is already more than double last year’s modest volume: year-to-date, total private label issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities is over $75bn, an increase of 140% compared to the same period in 2023. \n\n\n\n\n### Opportunities\n\n  * **Corporate structured credit offers higher average yields than traditional credit asset classes:** CLO debt has shown significant resilience throughout various market dislocations since the Global Financial Crisis, including the pronounced fluctuations in 2020 and 2022-23, as evidenced by their low long-term loss rates. (See Figure 16.) \n\n  * **New loan supply may increase in the near future:** As central banks continue along the path of cutting interest rates, M&A and LBO activity, which has been lackluster in recent years, could pick up, creating a supply of new loans. \n\n  * **While valuations in the CMBS market appear to be stabilizing, the bank market remains sidelined due to an excess of CRE loans made before 2022:** The bank pullback has created a significant void of capital for borrowers seeking to acquire or refinance existing assets, presenting an opportunity for non-bank lenders with available capital and limited problems in their existing portfolios. \n\n\n\n\n### Risks\n\n  * **Limited supply of new loans may lead to underwriting compromises:** Limited new loan supply but ample demand means some CLO managers may fill warehouses with low quality paper. \n\n  * **Weakness in the office sector may persist:** The sector continues to face multiple headwinds, and its performance will likely continue to weigh on real estate structured credit indices throughout the remainder of the year. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Structured Credit Has Historically Had Lower Loss Rates than Traditional Credit\n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-16.png?sfvrsn=d4965466_1)\n\nSource: JP Morgan Research (High Yield Bonds, 1978-2024), J.P. Morgan Research (Leveraged Loans, 1998-2024), Moody’s (CLOs, 1993-2023, updated annually), J.P. Morgan Research (SASB CMBS and large loan floaters, 1996-2024), as of September 30, 2024, updated quarterly unless otherwise stated.\n\nPrivate Credit\n\n**Market Conditions: 3Q2024 **\n\n  * **Private credit’s susceptibility to creditor-on-creditor violence is lower than the broadly syndicated loan market:** This is largely due to (a) the absence of multiple classes of debt in most transactions, (b) tighter credit documentation, and (c) strong relationships between borrowers, sponsors, and lenders, given that direct lending typically has a smaller lender base. Thus, sponsors often find it difficult to execute aggressive liability management exercises (i.e., the transactions behind creditor-on-creditor violence), as most lenders lend at par and secondary trading is less common. \n\n  * **European private credit deal volume and average size continue to rise:** Deal volume rebounded meaningfully in the second quarter: the asset class recorded 246 deals during the period, a 110% increase compared to the first quarter and the highest since tracking began in 2012.42 In the first half of the year, strategic bolt-on acquisitions represented 36% of transactions across Europe (excluding the UK).43\n\n\n\n\n### Opportunities\n\n  * **Fixed-rate junior capital can help investors lock in today’s elevated yield:** Roughly 50% of today’s all-in yield on floating-rate debt is attributable to base rates; the yield on senior direct lending portfolios is therefore expected to fall if interest rates continue to decline. However, the fixed-rate nature of junior capital solutions offers investors the opportunity to maintain higher yields moving forward. \n\n  * **Recovering equity valuations may signal an upcoming rise in non-sponsor activity:** Stabilizing earnings in the Russell 2000 index, a proxy for U.S. middle-market companies, could boost lender confidence and make non-sponsored companies more attractive for direct lending. (See Figure 17.) Moreover, non-sponsored companies may also seek financing for growth, acquisitions, or other strategic initiatives, creating more opportunities for customized financing solutions from direct lenders. \n\n\n\n\n### Risks\n\n  * **Pricing is near all-time tights and the dispersion of risk has grown:** The average pricing on a senior sponsored first lien loan is currently hovering around SOFR+4.75%. Deals executed at higher yields today are typically more intricate and come with greater risk. Some credit managers are willing to assume more risk to sustain the yields offered during the same period last year. However, we believe caution remains warranted as the incremental yield may not justify the additional risk. \n\n  * **Interest rate reductions may cause borrowers to increase leverage levels:** As interest rates decrease, companies will benefit from lower interest expense on floating-rate debt. As debt becomes relatively cheaper, some sponsors may look to increase leverage levels to boost their returns on equity, which in turn increases risk. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Non-Sponsor Activity May Increase as Equity Valuations Stabilize\n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/pcq/3q2024/pcq3q2024-charts_final_figure-17.png?sfvrsn=1e955466_1)\n\nSource: Bloomberg, as of August 31, 2024\n\n#### Oaktree’s Performing Credit Platform\n\nOaktree Capital Management is a leading global alternative investment management firm with expertise in credit strategies.

Last month’s visit with clients in Australia is a case in point. We talked about the “sea change” I believe is taking place in interest rates and about the role of credit in portfolios, and in a few cases, this led to the general topic of asset allocation. The result wasn’t a lot of new ideas on the subject, but rather a new way to combine old ideas into a unified theory.\n\nBefore I proceed, I want to mention that, from time to time in this memo, I’ll say “generally,” “usually,” or “everything else being equal.” These caveats are likely applicable to many more sentences and ideas herein, but for the sake of readability, I’m not going to repeat them _ad nauseum_. In addition, I’m going to use a lot of graphics, as I truly believe one picture is worth a thousand words. Please bear in mind that these representations are intended to be notional, not technically correct.\n\nAsset Classes\n\nFrom my vantage point, “asset allocation” is a relatively new thing. No one used that phrase when I joined the industry 55 years ago. Structuring portfolios was a pretty simple matter, generally following the classic “60/40” split. Most U.S. investors limited themselves to investing in U.S. stocks and bonds, and there was a time-honored notion that something like 60% equities and 40% bonds represented reasonable diversification. \n\nToday, investors are presented with so many choices – and there’s so much emphasis on getting the decision right – that the term “asset allocation” is very prominent, and there are individuals and whole departments dedicated to doing just that. It’s their job to decide how to weight the asset classes to be held in a portfolio, meaning asset allocators spend their time on decisions like these:\n\n  * How much in equities and how much in debt?\n\n  * How much in stocks and bonds and how much in “alternatives”?\n\n  * How much in public securities and how much in private assets?\n\n  * How much in one’s home country and how much abroad?\n\n  * How much of the latter in the developed world and how much in emerging markets?\n\n  * How much in high quality assets and how much in low quality?\n\n  * How much in more volatile “high beta” assets and how much in steadier ones?\n\n  * How much in levered strategies and how much unlevered?\n\n  * How much in “real assets”?\n\n  * How much in derivatives?\n\n\n\n\nIt’s enough to make your head spin. Many investors use computer models to help with these decisions, but the models require inputs regarding expected return, risk, and correlation, and most of these are based on history and thus of questionable relevance to the future. Correlation between asset classes is particularly difficult to predict. It’s often a case of garbage in, garbage out (but with the added comfort that comes from using mathematical models). \n\nEver since coming up with my sea change thesis regarding interest rates two years ago, I’ve been talking about the increased utility of credit investments. And the more I’ve done so, the more I’ve thought about the difference between credit investments and equities. **Thus, the first thing I want to mention about my “Australian epiphany” is the unconventional idea that, at bottom, there are only two asset classes: ownership and debt.** If someone wants to participate financially in a business, the essential choice is between (a) owning part of it and (b) making a loan to it. \n\nWhen I moved from Citibank’s equity research department to its bond department in 1978, I learned firsthand that this is a matter of night and day. On my new desk, I found a machine called a Monroe 360/65 Bond Trader. If you typed in a bond’s interest rate, maturity date, and market price, it would tell you the yield to maturity . . . in other words, what your return would be if you bought the bond at that price and held it to maturity (and it paid). **This was revolutionary to me. On the equity side I’d come from, there was no place you could look to find out what your return would be.**\n\nThis highlighted for me something I’ve always felt most investors don’t grasp viscerally: the essential difference between stocks and bonds . . . that is, between ownership and lending. Investors seem to think of stocks and bonds as two things that fall under the same heading. But the difference is enormous. **In fact, ownership and lending have nothing in common:**\n\n  * Owners put their money at risk with no promise of a return. They acquire a piece of a business or other asset and **are entitled to their proportional share of any residual** that remains after the necessary payments have been made to employees, providers of raw materials, landlords, tax authorities, and, of course, lenders. If there’s something left over, it’s called profit or cash flow, and the owners have the right to share in whatever part of it is paid out. And if there’s profit or cash flow (or the potential for it in the future), the business will have “enterprise value,” in which the owners also share.\n\n  * Lenders typically provide funds to help owners purchase or operate businesses or other assets and, in exchange, are promised periodic interest and the repayment of principal at the end. **The relationship between borrower and lender is contractual,** and the resulting return is known in advance as described above, again assuming the borrower makes the promised payments when due. That’s why this kind of investing is called “fixed income” – the income is fixed. For the purposes of this memo, however, it might help to think of it as “fixed outcome” investing. \n\n\n\n\n**This isn’t a difference in degree; it’s a difference in kind.** Ownership assets (things like common stocks, whole companies, real estate, private equity, and real assets) and debt (bonds, loans, mortgage backed securities, and other streams of promised payments) should be thought of as entirely different, not variations on a theme. They have different characteristics and potential, and the choice between them is one of the most basic things investors must decide.\n\nThe Essential Choice\n\nAt the outset of this memo, I listed some of the decisions that comprise the asset allocation process. But how can those decisions be approached? What’s the framework for making them? \n\nThe next piece that clicked into place in my thinking “down under” was with regard to the basic characteristics of a portfolio. **In my opinion, one decision matters more than – and should set the basis for – all the other decisions in the portfolio management process. It’s the selection of a targeted “risk posture,” or the desired balance between aggressiveness and defensiveness.** The essential decision in investing is how much emphasis one should put on preserving capital and how much on growing it. These two things are mostly mutually exclusive:\n\n  * Insistence on preserving capital – or, secondarily, on limiting the portfolio’s volatility – calls for an emphasis on defense, which precludes pursuing maximum growth. \n\n  * Correspondingly, a decision to strive to maximize growth requires an emphasis on offense, meaning preservation of capital and steadiness must be sacrificed to some degree. \n\n\n\n\n**It’s one or the other. You can’t simultaneously emphasize both preservation of capital and maximization of growth, or defense and offense. This is the fundamental, inescapable truth in investing. The questions listed on page one are just details, the options available for reaching your targeted risk posture.**\n\nIf you think about portfolio construction in this sense – looking for the right balance between offense and defense – it becomes clear that the goal should be optimization, not maximization. To my mind, it shouldn’t be “wealth,” but “wealth pursued in an appropriate way, taking into account the investor’s wants and needs.” \n\nMany people think the proper goal in investing is achieving **the highest return**. More sophisticated thinkers understand – either intellectually or intuitively – that the goal should be to achieve **the best relationship between return and risk**. If you follow that latter mandate, it’ll hopefully lead you to assets whose expected return is more than sufficient to compensate for their risk, and thus to a portfolio with the potential for an attractive risk-adjusted return. But that’s not enough.\n\n**The absolute level of risk in a portfolio shouldn’t be an unwitting consequence of the asset allocation process described above, or of the search for superior risk-adjusted returns. The absolute risk level must be consciously targeted. In fact, in my view, it’s the most important thing. For an investment program to be successful, the level of risk in the portfolio must be well compensated and fall within the desired range . . . ****neither too much nor too little.**\n\nThe Shape of the Curves\n\nIn the last few months, I’ve been drawing probability distributions to illustrate the fundamental difference between the potential returns from ownership assets and debt (or “fixed income,” “credit,” or whatever you want to call it). Here’s the general shape of the curve describing the potential return on a portfolio of ownership assets (Figure 1):\n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/memos/commentary/hm-asset-allocation-graph1.png?sfvrsn=a2735566_1)\n\nAnd following on page four is the shape of the curve describing the potential return on a portfolio of debt (Figure 2):\n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/memos/commentary/hm-asset-allocation-graph2.png?sfvrsn=ca745566_1)\n\n**Ownership assets typically have a higher expected return, greater upside potential, and greater downside risk. Everything else being equal, the expected returns from debt are lower but likely to fall within a much tighter range.** There’s generally no upside on debt – no one should buy an 8% bond expecting to make more than 8% per year over the long term. But there’s also relatively little downside – you’ll get your 8% if the borrower pays, and relatively few fail to pay. For this reason, offense is usually better played through ownership assets, and defense is usually better played through debt. (I hasten to add that investing isn’t a matter of either/or. The two can be combined, meaning the operative question surrounds the right mix.)\n\nIn the low-interest-rate environment that prevailed from 2009 through 2021, the expected return from debt was extremely low in the absolute and far below the historical return on equities, rendering debt relatively unattractive (Figure 3). \n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/memos/commentary/hm-asset-allocation-graph3.png?sfvrsn=d8745566_1)\n\nBut today, it’s considerably higher than it was and closer to that of equities (Figure 4). That’s why I’ve been urging increased investment in credit.\n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/memos/commentary/hm-asset-allocation-graph4.png?sfvrsn=28735566_1)\n\nObviously, the relationship between the two curves at a point in time has a very direct bearing on the appropriate asset allocation at that time. \n\n**Which of the two is “better,” ownership or debt? We can’t say. In a market with any degree of efficiency – that is, rationality – it’s just a tradeoff. A higher expected return with further upside potential, at the cost of greater uncertainty, volatility, and downside risk? Or a more dependable but lower expected return, entailing less upside and less downside?** The choice between the two is subjective, largely a function of the investor’s circumstances and attitude toward bearing risk. That means the answer will be different for different investors.\n\nChoosing the Offense/Defense Balance\n\nI’ve previously expressed my view that, as a starting point, every investor or their investment manager should identify their appropriate normal risk posture or offense/defense balance. For each individual or institution, this decision should be informed by the investor’s investment horizon, financial condition, income, needs, aspirations, responsibilities, and, crucially, intestinal fortitude, or their ability to stomach ups and downs. \n\nOnce investors have specified the normal risk posture that’s right for them, they face a choice: they can maintain that posture all the time, or they can opt to depart from it on occasion in response to the movements of the market and thus changes in the attractiveness of the offerings it provides, increasing their emphasis on offense when the market is beaten down and on defense when it’s riding high. \n\nRegardless of whether one’s risk posture is fixed or variable, however, the next question is how one gets there. This question led me to think about another old idea: the relationship between risk and return. I’ve described a million times the way this was taught at the University of Chicago, beginning when I was there in the 1960s. It’s a graphical presentation we’ve all seen ever since, in which, as we move from left to right, increasing the expected risk, the expected return also increases (Figure 5): \n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/memos/commentary/hm-asset-allocation-graph5.png?sfvrsn=d735566_1)\n\nAs readers know, I always felt this representation was highly inadequate, since **the linearity of the relationship in the graph makes it appear too certain that increased risk will lead to increased return. This obviously belies the nature of risk.** So, in a memo in 2006, I took the same line and superimposed on it some bell-shaped curves representing probability distributions turned on their side. I did this to indicate the uncertain nature of returns from riskier assets (Figure 6): \n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/memos/commentary/hm-asset-allocation-graph6.png?sfvrsn=7a735566_1)\n\n**Now, we see that as the thing called “risk” increases (that is, as we move from left to right on the graph), not only does the expected return increase, but the range of possible outcomes becomes wider and the bad outcomes become worse.** That’s risk! (I hope this way of presenting risk will be considered a lasting contribution to the investment industry when I’m gone.)\n\nDoodling one day, I took the black and green curves describing ownership asset returns and debt returns from Figure 4 and added some intermediate positions in blue and red to indicate various combinations of the two. Thus, the blue curve is 2/3 debt and 1/3 ownership, and the red is 1/3 debt and 2/3 ownership (Figure 7):\n\n![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/memos/commentary/hm-asset-allocation-graph7.png?sfvrsn=56735566_1)\n\nIn Australia, as I was showing this diagram, it struck me that Figure 7 is just another way to represent the idea presented in Figure 6. Again, as we move from left to right (more ownership assets, less debt), the expected return increases and the expected risk increases (that is, just as in Figure 6, the range of possible outcomes grows wider and the left-hand tail stretches further into undesirable territory). This way of presenting the options might be more intuitively clear.\n\nSomeone who believes in “more risk, more return” as portrayed in Figure 5 should logically adopt a high-risk posture. But if they understand the real implications of increased risk, as suggested by Figures 6 and 7, then they might opt for something more moderate. \n\nThe Role of Alpha and Beta\n\nAll the foregoing assumes markets are efficient: \n\n  * As risk increases in an efficient market, expected return increases proportionally. Or maybe that’s better stated the other way around: as expected return increases, so does the accompanying risk (the uncertainty surrounding the outcome and the likelihood of a bad one). Thus, no position on the risk continuum (for example, in Figure 6) is “better” than any other. It’s all just a matter of where you want to come out in terms of absolute riskiness, or what absolute level of return you want to aim for. **The ratio of return to risk is similar at all points on the continuum** – less of both toward the left, and more of both toward the right. Said another way, there’s no free lunch. \n\n  * Also, looking at each position on the risk continuum, **the symmetricalness of the vertical distribution of possible returns around the expected return is similar from one position to the next****.** That means the ratio of upside potential to downside risk at one position on the continuum isn’t markedly better than it is at other positions – again no free lunch.\n\n  * Finally, if you want to move further out on the risk continuum, you can do so by either (a) investing in riskier assets or (b) applying leverage to the same assets (magnifying both the expected return and risk). Again, in a fully efficient market, **neither tactic is preferable to the other.**\n\n\n\n\nThe above three statements capture some of the important implications of supposed market efficiency.\n\nLooked at this way, the only thing that matters is getting to the right risk position for you; **under an assumption of market efficiency, there’s nothing to be gained in terms of return at a given level of risk. All ways of getting to a certain risk level will produce the same expected return.**\n\nThe reason for this is the academic view that, in an efficient market, (a) all assets are priced fairly relative to each other, such that there are no bargains or over-pricings to take advantage of and (b) there’s no such thing as alpha, which I define as “gains resulting from superior individual skill.” **As a result, there’s nothing to be gained from active decision making: no asset class, strategy, security or manager is “better” than any other. They merely vary in terms of risk and resulting return.**\n\nAlso in the academic view, since there’s no such thing as alpha, the only thing that differentiates assets is their beta, or their relative volatility, the extent to which they reflect market movements. In the theory, it’s beta that expected returns are proportional to.\n\nNow it’s time for me to assert strenuously that, **in reality, markets are not efficient in the academic sense of always being “right.”** Markets may do an efficient job of (a) rapidly incorporating new information and (b) accurately reflecting the resulting consensus opinion concerning the right price for each asset given the totality of information, **but that opinion can be far from correct.** For that reason, gains can be achieved by choosing skillfully among the options: \n\n  * some assets, markets or strategies can offer a better risk/return bargain than others, and \n\n  * some managers can operate within a market or strategy to produce superior risk-adjusted returns.\n\n\n\n\nThis last idea raises one of the key questions in asset allocation: should you consider departing from your “sweet spot” in terms of risk level in order to invest in a riskier asset class with a manager believed to possess alpha? There’s no easy answer to this question, especially given that many managers who are believed to possess alpha turn out not to. \n\nTo conclude, I’ll recap the key points:\n\n  * Fundamentally speaking, the only asset classes are ownership and debt.\n\n  * They differ enormously in terms of their fundamental nature.\n\n  * Ownership assets and debt assets should be combined to get your portfolio to the position on the risk/return continuum that’s right for you. This is the most important decision in portfolio management or asset allocation.\n\n  * The other decisions are merely a matter of implementation.\n\n  * Of course, your asset allocation process will be informed by how you rate your ability to identify and access superior strategies and superior managers, recognizing that doing so isn’t easy. \n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nMoving on to the real world, I want to make some important observations regarding one of Oaktree’s key sectors, non-investment grade credit (defined as performing non-government debt):\n\n  * The prospective returns in this area today are much higher than they were in the 2009-21 period.\n\n  * These returns, starting at roughly 7% on public credit and 10% on private credit, are competitive with the historical returns on equities and capable of helping many investors toward their overall return targets.\n\n  * Because of their contractual nature, the returns from credit are likely to prove much more dependable than ownership returns. \n\n\n\n\nIn my view, the thought process set forth in this memo leads to the conclusion that investors should increase their allocations in this area if they are (a) attracted by returns of 7-10% or so, (b) desirous of limiting uncertainty and volatility, and (c) willing to forgo upside potential beyond today’s yields to do so. For me, that should include a lot of investors, even if not everyone.\n\nMy recommendation at this time is that investors do the research required to increase their allocation to credit, establish a “program” for doing so, and take a partial step to implement it. While today’s potential returns are attractive in the absolute, higher returns were available on credit a year or two ago, and we could see them again if markets come to be less ruled by optimism. I believe there will be such a time. \n\nThank you for indulging me in this foray into investment philosophy. I hope you’ve found it of value.\n\nOctober 22, 2024\n\nLegal Information and Disclosures\n\n _This memorandum expresses the views of the author as of the date indicated and such views are subject to change without notice.

But even though debt costs are moderating, we still believe the corporate credit market is bifurcating. While the majority of companies will likely be able to comfortably refinance their debt in the coming year, a meaningful percentage may struggle. In the current installment of _The Roundup_ ,1 Oaktree examines the risks and opportunities in various asset classes at a time when diligence – and attentiveness to documentation – is paramount. \n\n## 1\n\n### Market Outlook: Split Personality\n\n**Robert O’Leary**\n\nCo-CEO and Portfolio Manager, Global Opportunities\n\n[![](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/oleary-robert.jpg?sfvrsn=6d6a7c66_12)](/about/leadership/bio/robert-oleary)\n\nIn [_Performing Credit Quarterly 2Q2024: The Dual Economy_](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/insight-commentary/market-commentary/performing-credit-quarterly-2q2024-the-dual-economy), we discussed the bifurcated consumer economy: the wealthy “haves” remain in a strong financial position while the ‘‘have-nots’’ are struggling. A similar dynamic can be seen in the credit markets. The rapid monetary policy tightening cycle that began in 2022 has created a clear distinction among borrowers. While the majority still have strong fundamentals, a subset has burned through their liquidity buffers, creating a large universe for opportunistic investors. \n\nSince the Global Financial Crisis, there has been an unprecedented buildup of all forms of debt, particularly lower-rated credit. Outstanding leveraged loan, high yield bond, BBB-rated bond, and private credit debt has roughly quadrupled since 2007 to over $13 trillion today.2 Thus, even if default rates remain low by historical standards due to the bifurcation among borrowers, the total amount of distressed credit will still likely be massive.\n\nBeyond the sheer scale, one other major feature of the debt buildup in recent years was the drastic loosening of terms in credit documentation. Since 2020, issuance of covenant-lite loans (i.e., those lacking protective covenants) has exceeded $1.5 trillion.3 As we note in _Value Opportunities: Navigating the Docs_ , this has paved the way for a record volume of liability management exercises, in which a borrower restructures its existing debt outside of court. LMEs can help companies avoid formally defaulting, which often involves a long and expensive Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. \n\nWhile the maturity wall in sub-investment grade debt has shrunk in recent quarters, it still remains imposing. And given that a meaningful number of issuers facing near-term maturities have weak fundamentals, we anticipate that LME activity will only increase in the coming year. In order to successfully navigate this environment, credit investors will require legal acumen and adequate resources to parse through extremely complex legal documents. \n\nThe current credit environment is uncharted territory for many investors – given the many uncommon events and trends that have shaped it – but what hasn’t changed is the need to have size, expertise, and the ability to understand the docs. \n\n## 2\n\n### Value Opportunities: Navigating the Docs\n\n**Bruce Karsh**\n\nCo-Chairman, Chief Investment Officer\n\n[![Bruce Karsh](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/karsh-bruce.jpg?sfvrsn=5b627c66_20)](/about/leadership/bio/bruce-karsh)\n\n**Steven Tesoriere**\n\nCo-Portfolio Manager, Value Opportunities\n\n[![Steven Tesoriere](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/tesoriere-steve.jpg?sfvrsn=32737c66_10)](/about/leadership/bio/steve-tesoriere)\n\nIn the past two years, a major trend has emerged in credit markets: the increasing prevalence of liability management exercises (LMEs). An LME occurs when a borrower at risk of defaulting restructures its liabilities outside of court by directly negotiating with its creditors or by securing rescue capital from outside parties. As a result of the unprecedented number of LMEs this year, the volume of distressed exchanges so far in 2024 is already approaching the record high set during the Global Financial Crisis and is on track to well exceed that amount.4 (See Figure 1.)\n\nOverleveraged borrowers have been increasingly turning to LMEs to avoid the formal Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. They’ve been able to do so primarily because of (a) the proliferation of opportunistic lending funds in the last decade and (b) the ubiquity of covenant-lite debt in sub-investment grade credit issued in the years leading up to 2022, which has given borrowers more flexibility to avoid official defaults. \n\nIn a typical LME, the borrower raises new debt that is either senior to the existing debt or backed by collateral that had previously been pledged to the existing debt. LMEs are thus often to the detriment of unsuspecting existing lenders, who may find the collateral underpinning their debt to be less secure than initially thought. Complacent credit investors, who might not possess the legal acumen to parse through dense legal documents, are therefore at risk of experiencing meaningful losses.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve found that LMEs rarely solve the troubled borrower’s fundamental problem: too much debt. Thus far in 2024, nearly 35% of defaults and LMEs involved companies that had previously defaulted or executed an LME.5\n\nLMEs likely aren’t going away any time soon. But there are ways to mitigate the risk of being on the wrong end of one. For instance, when underwriting prospective secondary-market debt investments, investors should seek to (a) build a large enough position in the debt tranche to effectively block an LME and/or (b) buy at a price that already reflects the risk of one of these exercises. \n\nEven though the rise in LMEs has created risk – especially for inexperienced creditors – we also believe it has generated significant opportunities for investors with size, experience, and the skill to navigate today’s often contentious waters.\n\nFigure 1: The Volume of Distressed Exchanges Has Risen Significantly Since the GFC\n\n![The Volume of Distressed Exchanges Has Risen Significantly Since the GFC](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/quarterly-roundup/3q2024/3q2024-roundup-charts_final_figure-1.png?sfvrsn=4d3d5566_3)\n\nSource: JP Morgan, as of August 31, 20246\n\n## 3\n\n### Mezzanine Finance: Bridging the Gap\n\n**Raj Makam**\n\nPortfolio Manager, U.S. Private Debt\n\n[![Raj Makam](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/makam-raj.png?sfvrsn=3b6d7c66_5)](/about/leadership/bio/raj-makam)\n\n**Christina Lee**\n\nCo-Portfolio Manager, U.S. Private Debt\n\n[![Christina Lee](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/lee-christina.png?sfvrsn=196f7c66_5)](/about/leadership/bio/christina-lee)\n\nMezzanine financing – capital that sits between equity and senior debt – saw volumes drop during the protracted period of ultra-low interest rates following the Global Financial Crisis. But in today’s new credit environment, where interest rates are expected to settle well above zero, we believe junior capital will play a crucial role in meeting financing requirements for middle-market, upper-middle-market, and large cap private equity-owned companies.\n\nDuring the era of [easy money](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/easy-money), ultra-low interest rates led to a substantial rise in leveraged buyouts, which boosted purchase price multiples. In fact, leverage in these deals averaged 6x EBITDA between 2019-22.7 Many of these companies saw their interest costs nearly double in recent years, which caused interest coverage ratios to decline. (See Figure 2.) This has created liquidity pressure and made senior debt more difficult to access. \n\nJunior capital has also become a favorable option for sponsors completing LBOs. It can enable sponsors to limit the amount of cash equity they have to commit at a time when the average LBO purchase price multiple is above 10.5x EBITDA8 and senior debt is still prohibitively expensive. So even though junior capital is pricier than senior debt, it’s still cheaper than other forms of financing and thus can enhance returns on equity. \n\nMeanwhile, U.S. corporate borrowers are facing a meaningful maturity wall. Roughly $1.9 trillion of below-investment grade debt is set to mature between 2024 and 2028.9 Companies are therefore increasingly seeking junior capital solutions to fill the funding gap. \n\nThe economy appears to be at a pivot point now that the Federal Reserve has begun to cut interest rates. But this may make mezzanine debt even more attractive. First, the fixed-rate nature of most junior capital instruments offers mezzanine investors the chance to lock in today’s high yields. And, importantly, the added flexibility mezzanine capital provides relative to senior debt will likely ensure sustained demand from both borrowers and sponsors, regardless of the interest rate cuts expected to occur in the next year. \n\nIn other words, investors in mezzanine financing today have the potential opportunity to take advantage of a set of circumstances that doesn’t come around too often.\n\nFigure 2: Interest Coverage Ratios Are Under Pressure\n\n![Interest Coverage Ratios Are Under Pressure](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/quarterly-roundup/3q2024/3q2024-roundup-charts_final_figure-2.png?sfvrsn=4f3d5566_3)\n\nSource: Moody’s Investors Service, as of December 31, 202310\n\n## 4\n\n### Opportunistic Real Estate: Demographic Dividend\n\n**John Brady**\n\nGlobal Head of Real Estate\n\n[![John Brady Headshot](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/john-brady_pubweb.jpg?sfvrsn=48924d66_5)](/about/leadership/bio/john-brady)\n\n**Ambrose Fisher**\n\nCo-Portfolio Manager, Real Estate Opportunities\n\n[![Ambrose Fisher Headshot](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/ambrose-fisher_pubweb.jpg?sfvrsn=a1934d66_5)](/about/leadership/bio/ambrose-fisher)\n\n**Todd Liker**\n\nCo-Portfolio Manager, Real Estate Opportunities\n\n[![Todd Liker Headshot](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/liker-todd.png?sfvrsn=ed6f7c66_5)](/about/leadership/bio/todd-liker)\n\nThe rapidly aging population and accompanying rise in healthcare spending has created an attractive opportunity to invest in medical outpatient buildings (MOBs), including primary and specialty care units, surgery centers, outpatient clinics, emergency departments, and other medical facilities.\n\nThe U.S. population is aging at an unprecedented rate: the median age has risen from 30 to 39 over the past four decades.11 By 2050, the population of Americans aged 65 and over is projected to increase by nearly 50%12 to include nearly one in four Americans. This demographic shift is likely to increase already-high national healthcare expenditures: the annual figure is expected to hit nearly $7.8 trillion by 2032.13\n\nThat’s partly because U.S. residents over the age of 65 visit the doctor three times more frequently than the general population, on average, with chronic conditions cited as the primary reason for 56% of the former group’s outpatient medical visits in total.14 It is estimated that 230 million Americans, or nearly 70% of the projected total population,15 could be living with one or more chronic conditions by 2030.16 During the same period, the volume of outpatients aged 80-84 is expected to increase by over 65% from the level seen in 2021.17 (See Figure 3.) \n\nWhile rapid growth in the U.S. elderly population is boosting demand for outpatient medical services, the supply of MOBs isn’t increasing at the same pace. The average occupancy rate at MOBs across the U.S. currently sits at 93%.18 This figure is expected to move higher in the coming years because development of new MOBs has been limited since 2021 and construction starts for this property type still remain well below pre-pandemic levels.19\n\nIn short, real estate investors have a rare opportunity to benefit from this secular demographic trend while playing a key role in addressing the supply/demand imbalance in the MOB market. \n\nFigure 3: Outpatient Volume Among the Elderly Population Is Projected to Grow Meaningfully from 2021-31\n\n![Outpatient Volume Among the Elderly Population Is Projected to Grow Meaningfully from 2021-31](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/quarterly-roundup/3q2024/3q2024-roundup-charts_final_figure-3.png?sfvrsn=523d5566_1)\n\nSource: JLL Research, Advisory Board, as of April 2024\n\n## 5\n\n### Emerging Markets Equities: Shareholders Rising\n\n**Frank Carroll**\n\nPortfolio Manager, Emerging Markets Equities\n\n[![Frank Carroll Headshot](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/frank-carroll_pubweb.jpg?sfvrsn=5ddf5566_2)](/about/leadership/bio/frank-carroll)\n\n**Janet Wang**\n\nCo-Portfolio Manager, Emerging Markets Equities\n\n[![Janet Wang Headshot](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/bio/wang-janet.png?sfvrsn=a3727c66_5)](/about/leadership/bio/janet-wang)\n\nSeveral Asian countries are following Japan’s lead in recognizing the benefits of improving corporate governance.\n\nIn early 2023, Japan introduced its stock exchange reform program, which sought to enhance corporate valuations by addressing the country’s historically widespread capital mismanagement. Since the announcement, Japanese businesses that have adopted the program’s best practices have meaningfully outperformed the MSCI Japan Index. (See Figure 4.) Subsequently, we’ve seen similar efforts in many Asian countries, especially China and Korea, where the governments are now pushing for greater focus on shareholder returns and enhanced transparency in corporate governance. \n\nKorea’s equity market has traditionally been undervalued because of its weakness in these areas. Thus, regulators recently introduced the corporate “Value Up” program, which includes measures and policies designed to improve capital management, shareholder returns, and stock valuations. In turn, three key sectors where corporate governance is particularly imperative – banks, autos, and insurance – have all outperformed the MSCI Korea Index by over 15% thus far in 2024.20 We believe Korea is on the road to becoming classified as a developed country and expect to see a gradual rerating over the next few years. \n\nSimilarly, several large Chinese companies have been taking a proactive approach to improving shareholder returns in 2024, even as China’s equity market has continued to struggle broadly due to concerns about the country’s growth outlook. This is especially true of state-owned enterprises. For example, the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China recently reported strong performance, largely because it introduced plans to pay its first ever interim dividend this year.21\n\nWe anticipate that the companies implementing reform programs throughout Asia will see their valuation multiples rise over time, even if slowing global growth weighs on broad market performance in the short term. And, importantly, if these programs continue to elicit a positive response from investors, then EM countries in other regions are also likely to put greater emphasis on improving shareholder returns moving forward. \n\nFigure 4: Japanese Companies Adopting “Value Up” Best Practices Have Outperformed the Market \n\n![Japanese Companies Adopting “Value Up” Best Practices Have Outperformed the Market ](/images/oaktreecaplibraries/insights/market-commentary/quarterly-roundup/3q2024/3q2024-roundup-charts_final_figure-4.png?sfvrsn=a03d5566_1)\n\nSource: JP Morgan, as of March 12, 2024\n\nEndnotes\n\n  1. 1 The content is derived from or inspired by ideas in 2Q2024 letters or other materials sent to clients in 3Q2024; the text has been edited for space, updated, and expanded upon where appropriate. \n\n  2. 2 Credit Suisse, ICE BofA, Preqin, Cliffwater, as of September 2024; For middle-market direct lending data: Preqin, as of June 2022. \n\n  3. 3 Pitchbook. \n\n  4. 4 JP Morgan as of August 31, 2024. \n\n  5. 5 JP Morgan as of August 31, 2024. \n\n  6. 6 FY2024 Projection assumes average monthly rate of distressed exchanges YTD2024 for the four remaining months of the year.

Trump’s call for tariffs and Harris’s attack on grocery profiteering are merely two examples of proposals that would impose costs the candidate ignores (in Trump’s case) or that fail to reflect a meaningful understanding of the problem (in Harris’s case). My purpose, of course, is not to promote or dismiss either candidate, but rather to illustrate that there is no “free lunch” in economics, despite candidates’ assertions to the contrary. \n\nThe Background\n\nIn 2016, with an unusually clamorous presidential election in full swing, I published two memos that strayed from investing into the world at large, called [_Economic Reality_](/docs/default-source/memos/economic-reality.pdf?sfvrsn=49bc1865_6) and [_Political Reality_](/docs/default-source/memos/political-reality.pdf?sfvrsn=39391265_2). The first explained that economics is largely the study of how we make choices – how people allocate finite resources among the available options. The second stated that in politics – and especially in the land of campaign promises – there’s no such thing as finiteness. As I wrote in _Political Reality_ :\n\nI’ve always gotten a kick out of oxymorons – phrases that are internally contradictory – such as “jumbo shrimp” and “common sense.” I’ll add “political reality” to the list. The world of politics has its own, altered reality, in which economic reality often seems not to impinge. No choices need be made: candidates can promise it all. And there are no consequences. If something might have negative consequences in the real world, politicians seem to feel free to ignore them. \n\nI followed those two memos with one in 2019 entitled [_Political Reality Meets Economic Reality_](/docs/default-source/memos/political-reality-meets-economic-reality.pdf?sfvrsn=21c1d665_8). **Its main thrust was that politicians can promise whatever they want regarding the economy, but they won’t be able to deliver if their promises fly in the face of economic reality because, ultimately, the laws of economics are incontrovertible. Free economies are driven by self-interested decisions made by millions of producers and consumers, employers and employees, and savers and investors. Governments can pass laws designed to encourage or even compel behavior, but in general they can’t mandate economic outcomes. There are so many moving pieces and second-order consequences that governments generally can’t engineer both prosperity and the specific economic outcomes that policymakers may seek.**\n\nHistory is littered with command economies that didn’t succeed. There’s proof for this that includes the “control group” required by the scientific method. Eighty years ago, Korea was a single country. Then, following World War II, it was split in two, obviously with similar people, geography and resources: South Korea (under U.S. influence), and North Korea (under Soviet influence). Since then, South Korea has operated as a capitalist democracy and North Korea as a communist dictatorship. There’s little reliable economic data regarding North Korea, but according to the CIA’s _Worldbook_ , its GDP in purchasing power terms is estimated at $2,000 per person versus $50,000 in South Korea. North Korea’s citizens are described as impoverished, but at least it doesn’t have a border problem, since nobody’s trying to sneak in. There are political differences (democracy versus dictatorship) in addition to the economic ones, but **I think it’s fair to say capitalism has won**.\n\nIn discussions of economic systems, I usually ask people what they think has been responsible for the economic preeminence the U.S. has enjoyed since the end of World War I, and thus for its citizens’ higher average standard of living. Are Americans smarter? Harder working? More deserving? None of the above. I’m confident it’s because of our historical embrace of the free-market system and capitalism.\n\n**The incentives provided by free markets efficiently direct capital and other resources where they’ll be most productive. They prompt producers to make the goods people want most and workers to take the jobs where they’ll be most productive in terms of the value of their output. And they encourage hard work and risk taking.** The result is a higher standard of living for society in general, but certainly not everyone benefits to the same degree. Thanks to the way incentives interact with people’s different abilities, some people do considerably better than others. Some also prosper thanks to good luck and/or inherited advantage, rather than innate ability. **The free-market system doesn’t necessarily produce “fair” outcomes in all circumstances, but economic systems designed to do so generally don’t provide the incentives needed to encourage economic productivity for the collective good. That’s what accounts for their record of failure.**\n\nOn August 15, the media reported that the next day, Vice President Harris would announce her economic policies. The bulk of the attention went to her promise to ban price gouging in the grocery industry. “Grocery prices … have jumped 26 percent since 2019, according to Elizabeth Pancotti, director of special initiatives at the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning think tank” (_The Washington Post_ , August 15), and many voters say inflation is their greatest concern. For this combination of reasons, Harris’s targeting of grocery prices is entirely predictable. (Ironically, August 15 was also the day U.S. inflation was reported to have fallen below 3% for the first time since March 2021.) I’m certain, however, that this falls under the heading of simplistic economic solutions that are designed to appeal to voters but are unsoundly based and likely to fail. \n\nWhat Is Price Gouging?\n\n**Price gouging is generally defined as sellers taking advantage of market power or temporary supply/demand imbalances to raise prices to levels that otherwise wouldn’t prevail.** And food prices did rise significantly in 2021 and 2022, leading to suspicion of food retailers. But might there be reasons for the price increases other than a malevolent decision to gouge on the part of sellers? Here are a few possibilities:\n\n  * When the pandemic began in March 2020, most people stayed home and cooked their own meals, significantly increasing the demand for groceries and depleting inventories. \n\n  * The production system was disrupted, with inputs in short supply or in the wrong places relative to the needs. This led to the much-discussed “supply-chain problems.” Too few goods – when coupled with too much money chasing them – constitute the classic reason for inflation. \n\n  * The federal government sent taxpayers massive amounts of Covid-19 relief. Many more people received benefits than had been hurt financially by the pandemic. Those people came out ahead, capturing trillions of dollars for future spending.\n\n  * When the Delta variant of Covid popped up in mid-2021, people again stayed home and shrunk from contact with others, spending more on goods and less on services than they otherwise might have. Demand for goods was strong as a result, outstripping the limited supplies and causing prices to rise. \n\n\n\n\nProfit margins in the supermarket industry are low – about 1% to 2% of sales – and that changed only a little in 2021-22. So, was there gouging? And if gouging is the explanation for the price increases, why did it occur in those years, rather than sooner? Again, might today’s high prices be explained by something other than gouging? _The New York Times_ , rarely a defender of capitalism, wrote the following on August 15:\n\nResearchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reported last year that rapid job growth in the U.S. economy, and the wage increases that came with it, were major contributors to rising grocery prices.\n\nA number of factors contributed to the increase in food prices, many of them linked to the macro economy. **But the bottom line is that conditions allowed food sellers to raise prices, and they did so.**\n\nIs Raising Prices Wrong?\n\n**The above is the key question. Definitions of price gouging invariably include words like “unfair,” “excessive,” and “exorbitant.” These are subjective terms that are open to judgment and debate.** The propriety of behavior with regard to these words is usually in the eye of the beholder. The seller’s highly reasonable price increase is the customer’s gouging. The difficulty of defining gouging reminds me of those who say, “we’re not out to soak the rich; we just want to make them pay their fair share in taxes.” I’m far from saying the rich shouldn’t pay their “fair share,” but what’s the standard for a fair share, and who gets to set it?**In the same way, who determines whether prices are fair, and how?**\n\nWhen a supermarket raises the price of a necessity like bread, is that gouging? The answer is that it’s complicated, and that’s what makes it hard to regulate prices fairly.\n\n  * If the farmer pays more for fertilizer and labor and then charges the baker more for wheat, can the baker fairly pass that on to the supermarket in the form of a higher price for bread?\n\n  * If the baker raises the price he charges the supermarket for bread, is it wrong for the supermarket to pass on the increase to the consumer?\n\n  * If the supermarket’s employees demand higher pay, can it offset the increase by raising the prices of the things it sells?\n\n  * If demand increases because a hit TV show popularizes sandwiches, is it wrong for people in the supply chain to take advantage and charge more for bread? \n\n\n\n\nIn a free market, prices are determined by supply and demand. Is it wrong per se for providers of goods and services to raise prices in response to reduced supply or increased demand? A few examples should make clear the complex nature of this question.\n\n  * Uber applies “surge pricing” during rush hour, when more people want rides. Is that an unfair practice? If the government says Uber mustn’t do so, that will make rides available at prices below what some people would pay and deprive drivers of the full fare they could otherwise collect. And the rate the drivers would then receive might not be high enough to justify the time they’d spend stuck in traffic, meaning fewer drivers would be available to handle the peak demand and people needing rides would remain unserved.**Is that preferable?**\n\n  * If 1,000 tickets for a Taylor Swift concert are put on sale at $100 and 3,000 people line up to buy them, what’s the message? Simple: they’re too cheap! Would it be unfair for the concert promoter to raise the price until there are just 1,000 people in line? Few people would say so. But if instead the price remains at $100 and the first 1,000 people buy them all, that leaves unmet demand, in which case those who bought the tickets would be able to resell them for more than $100. The profit would go to the resellers, who got their tickets at a price that was too low. Is that fair? **Wouldn’t it be fairer if the ticket prices were raised and the increment went to Tay Tay, reflecting the full value her fans put on her labor?**\n\n  * In 2021, when people wanted to leave their city apartments, and homes and building materials were in short supply, home prices shot upward. If you owned a home worth $400,000 in 2019 and asked $500,000 for it in the post-pandemic environment, was your behavior immoral? **Should the government prosecute people who asked more for their homes?**\n\n  * Lastly, when the economy sprung back to life in 2021 and there were multiple job openings per unemployed worker, making higher salaries attainable, workers were able to tell the boss, “I can get a higher salary down the road. If you don’t give me a raise, I’m leaving.” Should the government limit wage increases at a time when employees have an edge in negotiations? In the fall of 2023, the United Auto Workers union took advantage of the bargaining power caused by the tight labor conditions to extract from Ford “an 11% wage increase in the first year, and total 25% increase in wages over the 4.5 year contract, a $5,000 ratification bonus and a cost-of-living adjustment.” (Wikipedia)**This was a huge package. Did it represent gouging?**\n\n\n\n\n**Each of these examples shows one party taking advantage of supply/demand conditions to charge more for the thing they have to offer. But certainly, their actions aren’t illegitimate. They’re simply examples of how markets work.**\n\nThe alternative would be to have the government decide who should prevail in each case. Should it be the Uber driver or the passenger; the concertgoer or the performer; the homeowner or the homebuyer; the worker or the employer? Many have a knee-jerk tendency to sympathize with the passenger, concertgoer, homebuyer, and worker, as it’s easy to care less about the person who’s profiting: the driver, popstar, homeowner, and employer. **But if the government puts its thumb on the scale in favor of one party or the other, it distorts the workings of the free market and keeps it from functioning efficiently on behalf of society overall.** More on this later.\n\nThere are forms of seller behavior that are clearly wrong. These include collusion, price fixing, and predatory pricing designed to drive competitors out of the market. But laws prohibiting these behaviors are already on the books. Additional laws designed to prohibit and punish price increases that someone _views_ as unfair, excessive or exorbitant – as opposed to being the result of improper conduct – are sure to prove difficult to enforce and counter-productive.\n\nWould a Law Against Price Gouging Work? \n\nJust as history is full of failed command economies, it also shows the ineffectiveness of attempts to regulate prices. In 1974, when the OPEC oil embargo set off inflation that made life difficult for millions, the U.S. government countered by distributing “WIN” buttons, standing for Whip Inflation Now. I still have mine, but neither it nor the voluntary consumer actions that were supposed to follow were enough to keep inflation from reaching 13.5% in 1980. The buttons were derided, with some skeptics wearing them upside down, according to Wikipedia. “Worn that way, ‘NIM’ stood for ‘No Immediate Miracles,’ ‘Nonstop Inflation Merry-go-round,’ or ‘Need Immediate Money.’ ’’\n\nThere’s more recent experience with price controls, in Venezuela. Here’s what I said about it in _Economic Reality_ :\n\nA case in point is the price controls, which have expanded to apply to more and more goods: food and vital medicines, yes, but also car batteries, essential medical services, deodorant, diapers, and, of course, toilet paper. **The ostensible goal was to check inflation and keep goods affordable for the poor, but anyone with a basic grasp of economics could have foreseen the consequences:** When prices are set below production costs, sellers can’t afford to keep the shelves stocked. Official prices are low, but it’s a mirage: The products have disappeared. (_Atlantic Monthly_ , May 12, 2016, emphasis added)\n\n**Here’s a shocker: you can set prices for goods, but you can’t make people produce them.** That sounds a lot like economic reality. \n\nThis is an example of the fact that officials may believe they can control economic developments with a stroke of the pen, but they’ll be thwarted by second-order consequences that complicate the effort.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with trying to bring down the cost of necessities. However, the best way to do this is to encourage additions to supply. Another way is to not overstimulate demand by injecting excessive liquidity into the economy. **Mandating lower prices is generally the least effective way to get them.**\n\n**This is a good time for me to cite the economist’s adage that “the best solution for high prices is high prices.”** This isn’t a joke; far from it. In general, high prices mean demand is strong relative to supply. Eventually, those high prices will encourage producers to produce more and consumers to consume less, and the depressant impact on prices from both directions is obvious. We see this all the time in the oil market, for just one example. \n\nA government bureaucracy set up to regulate the price of food is very unlikely to succeed and almost certainly would have adverse effects. So, are there no benefits we can count on from price controls? I can think of one: thousands of new (albeit unproductive) jobs in that new bureaucracy. As Jason Furman, a relatively liberal economist, said of Harris’s anti-gouging efforts, “This is not sensible policy, and I think the biggest hope is that it ends up being a lot of rhetoric and no reality.”\n\nAnother Case in Point: Rent Control\n\nThe issue that first suggested this memo several months ago was rent control, something I’ve had personal experience with, having lived in an apartment that rented for $92 a month in 1956, when I was ten. \n\nThe federal government implemented rent control during World War II so that, with few new apartment buildings being built and breadwinners away fighting the war rather than earning their normal wages, families wouldn’t be priced out of their apartments. Rents on New York City apartments were frozen at 1943 levels. This was probably a good idea under the unusual circumstances of wartime, but the program wasn’t dismantled afterwards, and it still governs some apartments that were built more than 80 years ago. And rent regulation still plays havoc with the supply and demand for New York City apartments.\n\nIn general, New York City rent control limits rent increases on apartments so long as they’re occupied by people who were tenants in 1971 or relatives who lived with them. The law was enacted to protect the occupants at the time, but apartments have been passed down at controlled rents to people who didn’t necessarily live in them in 1971. Fewer and fewer people are still around who satisfy the above criterion, so this form of rent regulation is winding down. \n\nNewer regulations continue in force under the rubric of “rent stabilization.” One example is Mandatory Inclusionary Housing, which has been explained to me as follows: if you want to build an apartment building and need some zoning relief – and virtually all projects do – you must agree as follows:\n\n  * A percentage of the apartments will be “affordable.”\n\n  * Tenants for affordable apartments must earn incomes well below the average in the area.\n\n  * The maximum allowable rent will be set based on a percentage of tenants’ income.\n\n  * Rent increases upon lease renewal will be regulated, usually at a few percent per year.\n\n\n\n\nMost would agree that it’s laudable to encourage the creation of new affordable apartments, but this particular method of doing so has the related effect of increasing the cost of apartment construction. Probably everyone would be better off if there were simply more new apartments built every year. \n\nThe bottom line is that rents for the majority of New York City apartments remain subject to one form of control or another and are unlikely to ever become fully deregulated. As a result, the incentives to build new apartments are limited, and between 2002 and 2017, for example, the growth in the number of rental apartments in New York City was only 0.3%, per year. \n\nImprovements in regulated apartments are also regulated. Expenditures on improvements are limited to a very small amount in any 15-year period, and the investment can be recouped only through an increase in the monthly rent equal to a tiny percentage of the cost of the improvements. Thus, making improvements is generally uneconomic:\n\nMany landlords do not fill their vacant rent stabilized units, as the operational and renovation costs may exceed the legal maximum rent. As of 2022, there are roughly 20,000 vacant rent stabilized apartments in New York City. (Wikipedia) \n\nMight there be something wrong with a system where (a) there’s strong demand for apartments but (b) it’s more profitable to keep apartments vacant than rent them out? **Apartments aren’t much different from bread or toilet paper. Officials can limit the price people have to pay, which is popular with consumers, but other than in the most dictatorial jurisdictions, they can’t force suppliers to produce goods for sale at the regulated prices.**\n\nAs I’ve tried this year to keep up with articles about New York’s apartment situation, I’ve noticed that the following factors are usually listed as discouraging apartment creation: (a) a lack of tax incentives and subsidies, (b) resistance to construction of affordable apartment buildings in the suburbs, and (c) high interest rates (albeit the last one can’t be used to explain the low level of apartment construction in the 2010s). **What struck me most was the absence of any mention of the impact of rent regulations.**\n\nA February 9 article in _The New York Times_ particularly piqued my interest. The article reported that the percentage of New York City rental apartments that were “vacant and available” had fallen to 1.4%, the lowest since 1968. It went on to say, “Housing experts consider a healthy vacancy rate to be somewhere around 5 to 8 percent.” So why are so few apartments vacant? It comes down to supply and demand:\n\n  1. As in the example of Taylor Swift tickets, **they’re simply too cheap**. That means demand is strong and apartments don’t sit vacant.\n\n  2. Also, because rents are kept too low,**would-be builders can’t achieve attractive returns** , meaning there are few additions to supply. (I also imagine that if apartment builders could earn an acceptable return on investment, they’d have to worry about new regulations expropriating it.)\n\n\n\n\n**As mentioned earlier with regard to prices in general, if demand for apartments is strong and supply is restricted, the result should be rents that rise, encouraging landlords to add to supply. But market forces aren’t allowed to freely function in New York City; the laws of economics have been blunted by regulation.** The February 9 article included the following statements (and this is from _The New York Times_ , again usually not the capitalist’s friend):\n\nThe answer is that developers generally can’t make returns for building apartments that are competitive with the returns on other forms of investment. . . . \n\nHousing experts estimate that the number of homes the city needs to build is in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nSo far, however, the city and state have not made moves that could accelerate enough housing development to solve the crisis. . . .\n\n[Governor Kathy] Hochul said in a statement that the survey was “the latest reminder that we can only build our way out of this crisis.”\n\n**But it’s interesting to note that the “moves” that are described as having the potential to lead to “building our way out of this crisis” always emphasize government-provided subsidies and incentives, never allowing the free market to set rents.**\n\nA person in favor of this arrangement would argue that it maintains affordability and diversity.**What it means in purely economic terms is that some people who couldn’t afford to live in New York City if rents were set by free-market forces are able to live there if they’re lucky enough to secure an apartment with regulated rent. But other people who would like to live in New York City and can afford higher rents can’t do so because there are no apartments for them.** And lastly, landlords that have apartments that are somehow unregulated can command higher rents than would be the case if additions to the supply of apartments weren’t being discouraged. It’s a matter of personal philosophy whether this is good or bad. But clearly, the laws of economics and the actions of free markets aren’t at work in New York City. Someone in government is making the decisions.\n\nI’ll end this discussion with a comment Jason Furman made about grocery prices: \n\nMr. Furman . . . said . . . if prices do not rise in response to strong demand, new companies may not have as much inclination to jump into the market to ramp up supply. (_The New York Times_ , August 15)\n\nBy the way, as part of her August 16 economic package, Harris said she would prohibit landlords who own more than 50 apartments from raising rents by more than 5% for two years. That may or may not be a good idea, but it’s certainly not going to encourage increased investment in apartments. \n\nRegulatory Miscellany\n\nThere are so many examples of governmental attempts to ignore or override the laws of economics that it’s daunting to think of cataloging them, but I must discuss a few here, and their shortcomings:\n\n  * Another component of Harris’s economic program is a plan to **give first-time homebuyers $25,000 to help with down payments**. Certainly, it’s hard these days for young people to come up with the cash needed to become homeowners. The problem here is that giving a million would-be buyers $25,000 each, or $25 billion in all, would almost certainly result in an immediate increase in home prices, eliminating much of the hoped-for benefit from the program. Easy: that can be prevented by passing a law that prohibits current sellers from raising home prices in response to enactment of the program. But what about homes that will come onto the market in the future? Simple: enact another law that says you can’t ask more for your home than you would have if the program didn’t exist. Try enforcing that one.\n\n  * When he was president, Donald Trump enacted tariffs on goods from China to counter trade practices he considered unfair. Now, he promises **a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports**. Those tariffs might discourage imports, stimulate domestic production, and reduce the U.S.’s chronic trade deficit. But they’d likely be paid by consumers of imported goods, as manufacturers and exporters are unlikely to absorb a tariff if they can pass it on. For many years low-cost imports have held down inflation in the U.S. and enabled Americans to enjoy an attractive standard of living. Broad new tariffs are likely to be the equivalent of price increases for American consumers. And the tariffs – and those imposed by other nations in retaliation – would hamper globalization, which benefits the global economy by letting people in each nation do for the world what they’re best at.\n\n  * Trump’s policy proposals also include **extension of his expiring 2017 tax cuts and a panoply of new ones**. There’s something for everyone, with tax cuts for corporations and individuals, including ending the taxation of tips, Social Security benefits, and overtime pay. The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that in 2026, the plan would reduce taxes by $320 for the average person in the bottom income quintile and $47,220 for those in the top percentile. Even without factoring in the latest proposals, like exempting overtime pay, these actions are projected to increase the national deficit by $5.8 trillion over the next decade, or $4.1 trillion after incorporating their potential stimulative impact on the overall economy (so-called “trickle-down effects”). Other than that possibility, there’s no suggestion the cuts would be paid for.\n\n  * California is a Petri dish for so-called “progressive” economic ideas. In 2022, the state legislature passed a bill creating a council comprised of industry representatives and restaurant workers to set wages in the fast-food industry. Faced with a threatened industry-financed referendum to repeal the law, legislators modified it to mandate **a minimum hourly wage of $20 for fast food chains of more than 60 restaurants**. The new law only took effect in April, so it’s too early to assess its impact. Press accounts, however, are replete with accounts of restaurants closing, employees being laid off or having their hours reduced, employers investing in labor-saving technologies, and substantial price increases for the consumer. Although “mom and pop” restaurants are not required to pay the new minimum wage, predictably many have been forced to match the mandated rate to retain their employees, meaning the protection legislators intended for small restaurants may be illusory. That’s how the laws of economics work.\n\n  * Similarly, California passed a law mandating a **$25-an-hour minimum wage for workers in the healthcare industry**. But more recently, according to _The Wall Street Journal_ of May 27, officials realized that it “would cost the state $4 billion more a year owing to higher Medicaid costs and compensation for workers at state-owned facilities” and so they delayed the benefit of the law with respect to those workers. Shocking here is the idea that you can’t give money to someone without getting it from someone else, and California taxpayers might not enjoy the state directing more of it to healthcare workers, especially given the current budget deficit.\n\n  * If there’s one thing both parties agree on, it’s **“hands off Social Security!”** Retirees present and future want their monthly payments, and they want the rules left as they are. The leaders of both parties have agreed to this. It’s just that it can’t work. Social security is a contributory program analogous to insurance, and it works through a trust fund. Workers pay in via taxes and retirees get checks. But the number of retirees drawing benefits has been growing relative to the number of active workers paying in, and, if nothing is changed, the fund is sure to become insolvent through an inexorable mathematical process. There are many levers that could be pulled to restore Social Security to health, but nobody wants to pull them, since doing so would displease someone (that is, displease some voters). The options include (a) raising the Social Security tax rate, (b) raising the ceiling on the earnings on which tax is paid, (c) reducing benefits, (d) limiting cost-of-living adjustments, (e) raising the retirement age, (f) limiting the number of years for which retirees can collect, and (g) means testing would-be recipients. None of these is considered acceptable. Everyone just wants their checks as promised. \n\nIt doesn’t take a degree in economics to know what happens when people spend more than they bring in. (Only in political reality might someone expect a different outcome.) However, we don’t hear a word from politicians or elected officials about making the changes that are necessary to keep the Social Security trust fund from insolvency. The government can switch Social Security from a self-funded program to a government-funded benefit, of course, and at first glance, the change appears to be mainly semantic. But depleting the trust fund and paying benefits from the Treasury would add further to the already-troublesome deficit, the national debt, and the annual debt service, which would feed back to further increase the deficit and debt. \n\n\n\n\nThat leads me to a topic I’m asked about all around the world: the U.S. government’s deficit and debt. I answer that they’re an embarrassment. Oaktree is privileged to manage money for several countries that have sovereign wealth funds, not national debt. Some countries put windfalls into a lockbox, like Norway’s oil revenues or the proceeds from the privatization of Australia’s telephone company. And many other countries live within their means simply because they have to – they don’t have the luxury of printing unlimited amounts of money without precipitating a devaluation. But the U.S. habitually runs deficits, spending more than it takes in. Our last surplus came in 2000, at the end of the Clinton administration. Today, for the first time, simply the annual interest on our national debt exceeds the Defense Department budget. Yet neither party is willing to address the deficit or stand for balanced budgets. Our congress rarely submits a budget at all, no less a balanced one. **This is irresponsible behavior we wouldn’t tolerate in our own organizations.**\n\n**The U.S. acts as if it has a credit card with no limit on the balance and no requirement to pay it down. It does so because it’s been able to get away with it thus far, and our governing officials lack the will to spend less than they can.** We don’t hear much these days about Modern Monetary Theory, the view popularized in 2020 that “for countries in control of their currencies, deficits and debts don’t matter.” Nevertheless, our government still acts as if this theory is valid. \n\nIn the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes posited that when an economy is growing too slowly to produce the needed jobs, the government should increase spending to stimulate demand, even if that means running a deficit and covering it by borrowing. And then, when prosperity resumes and the jobs are there, it should spend less than it takes in, running a surplus and using it to repay the debt. All good, except for that last bit: the part about surpluses and debt repayment has been forgotten.\n\nThe truth is, deficits encourage the economic growth that most people enjoy, and spending more than the government takes in permits officials to give away “free stuff,” thereby gaining votes. **But doing this perpetually requires ignoring the laws of economics, running up debts in the apparent belief that they’ll never have to be paid. Can it go on without end? We’ll see, but I would think not.**\n\nWhat Are the Common Threads?\n\nThe actions and proposed actions described above, like the questions beginning at the bottom of page three, all have certain elements in common.\n\n  * The goals usually seem commendable on the surface: cheaper goods and services, and more equal outcomes. But, given the way things work in economics, they usually have second-order consequences that are uncontrollable and unhelpful. \n\n  * At their core, they’re all questions of “who gets what?” There’s no possibility of money appearing from out of the ether; there are just choices regarding who pays in and who gets something out. It’s a zero-sum game.\n\n  * The goals are often populist, with legislators and regulators picking winners and losers. They usually fashion their actions as protecting the downtrodden little guy from the rapacious big guy. Most anti-free-market regulations incorporate size criteria, meaning they only apply to supermarkets, not corner grocery stores; landlords with a lot of apartments; medical facilities of a certain size; and restaurant chains, not independents. In this context, we should note what President Biden said at the Democratic National Convention in August: “I’m proud to have been the first president to walk a picket line and be labeled the most pro-union president in history.” Are employees per se more deserving of protection than employers? Without employers, where would people get jobs? Regardless, they do serve as convenient targets for politicians.\n\n  * The rhetoric surrounding these matters is often alarmingly classist and divisive. Here’s part of a typical note I received from a candidate last month: “Even with inflation lowering [sic], food prices still seem sky-high. It’s another sign of corporate greed hurting . . . consumers. CEOs shouldn’t be lining their pockets with record profits while families struggle to put food on the table or pay for medications.” In this kind of environment, “profit” is a dirty word, and “greedy corporations” are ripe for suspicion and regulation. \n\n  * Finally, elected officials have a habit of exempting themselves from impact. Thus, it’s interesting to observe that California’s minimum fast-food wage doesn’t apply to restaurants in government facilities. What official wants to suffer the wrath of an employee forced to pay more for lunch?\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important characteristics of the laws of economics is that they apply to everyone. On the other hand, attempts to negate those laws are usually designed to affect some parties differently from others. Whenever this is the case, those in charge are picking would-be winners and losers. Not a great idea in a “free society.”\n\n**Fundamentally, government subsidies and economic regulations amount to encouraging actions that people wouldn’t take on their own. In other words, these actions wouldn’t happen in a free market.** Mandates like these should be examined critically. Some may stem from officials’ Solomonic decisions and desire for a fair society. Others are probably the result of a philosophic bias in favor of redistribution. And still others are just a matter of currying favor with voters.\n\nFor many career politicians, the first order of business is getting elected and reelected. Elected officials’ tinkering with the economy is often designed to appeal to voters. Then there’s the added benefit of getting officials off the hook, since they can redirect blame for politically undesirable developments to “bad actors,” such as powerful corporations and greedy landlords. Finally, economic regulations can provide temporarily palliative outcomes, with the negative side effects coming only in later years, when the officials who enacted them have left the political stage.\n\nFree Markets or Controlled Markets? That Is the Question\n\n**Governments don’t make a product, create value over and above the cost of the inputs they employ or – other than through their spending – contribute to GDP.** They collect (or print) money with one hand and distribute money and services with the other. They collect taxes from taxpayers and incur debts in the name of future taxpayers. Then they pay out money for benefit programs, salaries, capital expenditures, and subsidies. **Policymaking is about who will pay in and who will receive the benefits.**\n\nGovernments don’t strive for profits, meaning the people who run governments get a free pass on efficiency. Corporate management teams that fail to produce a product worth more than the inputs – aka make a profit – won’t last long. But governments aren’t expected to do so, and as a result, there’s no easy yardstick for quantifying a government’s effectiveness, like profits do for a business.\n\nGovernments do play essential roles that may have nothing to do with profits or value added.\n\n  * They provide things people can’t provide for themselves, such as defense, healthcare, police and fire services, education, infrastructure, and response to emergencies, both physical (floods, tornados, and pandemics) and economic (recessions and hyperinflation).\n\n  * They also provide safety nets for those who would otherwise suffer. There are extensive differences of opinion over how much of this governments should do, and those differences underly one of the biggest disagreements between the U.S. political parties. \n\n\n\n\nBeyond necessities, how far should a government go to even out its citizens’ incomes and quality of life? Doing so is one of the reasons why governments take from some to give to others as described above. **But it must be acknowledged that each step in this direction – as opposed to requiring people to fend for themselves – is a step in contravention of free-market forces, with consequences.**\n\n  * Darwin described the way species are strengthened through what is known as “survival of the fittest.” It works, and species evolve upward. But this is, by definition, a cold-blooded process through which the strong thrive and the weak perish. Good for the whole of the species, but not for every member.\n\n  * Likewise, the collective economic welfare of a society is maximized by the operation of the free market. In the process, some people do better than others – preferably, but certainly not always, the most talented, hardest working, and most deserving. Only in the most rose-colored (and ill-fated) systems is it not accepted that some people will do better than others. But the differential has expanded a great deal of late, and there is a growing debate as to “how much better” is fair and acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n**The choice is clear based on the evidence provided by history: (a) efficient free market economies with their incentives and uneven outcomes or (b) command economies with their uniform outcomes and sub-par performance.** On page two, I wrote the following:\n\nThe incentives provided by free markets direct capital and other resources where they’ll be most productive. They prompt producers to make the goods people want most and workers to take jobs where they’ll be most productive in terms of the value of their output. And they encourage hard work and risk taking. \n\nIn contrast, if markets are made less free – that is, if they’re forced to follow government edicts rather than the laws of economics:\n\n  * capital and raw materials will be directed to places other than where they’ll be most productive; \n\n  * producers will fail to make the things people want most, and instead will make things the government thinks people should have;\n\n  * workers will be assigned to work where they’ll produce less than they otherwise might; and\n\n  * hard work and risk taking won’t take place as much, since the rewards for doing those things will be capped and, in some cases, redirected to people who didn’t do the work or take the risk but whom those in control deem deserving.\n\n\n\n\n**Incentives and free markets are essential for a high-functioning economy, but their existence assures that some members of the economy will do better than others. You can’t have one without the other.**\n\nChina\n\nAt this point you might ask, “But what about China? The Chinese economy isn’t free to operate pursuant to the laws of economics, but it’s doing well.” We think of China as a “communist country,” replete with state-owned enterprises, industrial policy, and five-year plans. And yet, China’s GDP has grown at nearly 9% per annum for the last 45 years, and in 2010 it became the world’s second-largest economy. How could that be?\n\nAs it turns out, much of China’s economic success is attributable to a vibrant private sector. I’ve been visiting China for nearly 20 years and, especially during my early visits, I struggled to comprehend the logic that permits the coexistence of the collective ideology with private enterprise. Certainly, those are “strange bedfellows.” A visit to Xiamen, China earlier this month for the China International Fair for Investment & Trade reminded me of this conundrum. Regardless of the explanation, the fact is that China’s economy relies heavily on the dynamic private sector. In the summer of 2022, Edward Cunningham of the Harvard Kennedy School used a popular formulation to describe it:\n\nChina’s private sector is often summed up with a combination of four numbers: 60/70/80/90. Private firms contribute 60% of China’s GDP, 70% of its innovative capacity, 80% of its urban employment and 90% of new jobs. \n\nAnd the government recognizes this. On March 13, 2023, CNN reported on a statement from Chinese Premier Li Qiang:\n\n“For a period of time last year, there were some incorrect discussions and comments in the society, which made some private entrepreneurs feel worried,” Li said Monday. “From a new starting point, we will create a market-oriented, legalized and internationalized business environment, treat enterprises of all types of ownership equally, protect the property rights of enterprises and the rights and interests of entrepreneurs.” \n\n**Certainly, this represents a triumph of pragmatism over ideological purity. It’s a clear example of accommodating to economic reality rather than trying to override it.**\n\n* * *\n\nMy first step toward understanding the workings of the various economic systems came in junior high school in the late 1950s, when I read George Orwell’s _Animal Farm_. Orwell wrote it in 1945 as a thinly veiled critique of Russia and communism/socialism. That book taught me most of what I needed to know about free markets versus command economies. If you haven’t read it, or if you read it so long ago that you can’t remember what it says, I suggest you pick it up.\n\nIn the allegory of _Animal Farm_ , the animals took over the running of the farm. For me, the key lesson emanates from the motto they painted on the barn wall, borrowed from Karl Marx: “From each according to his ability; to each according to his needs.”\n\nWhat an idealistic statement! It would be great if everyone produced all they could, with the more able members of society producing more. And it would be great if everyone got what they need, with needier individuals getting more. But, as the animals on the farm soon learned, if workers only get to keep what they need, there’s no incentive for the more able among them to put in the additional effort required to produce a surplus from which to fill the needs of the less able.**The great challenge, of course, is to strike the proper balance: to take enough from the successful in the form of taxes to fund services, government programs, and wealth transfers without eroding their incentive to work or encouraging them to seek out low-tax jurisdictions.**\n\n**What I discuss above are the economic facts of life, and some of their ramifications may be less than ideal. But idealists’ wishes don’t govern economies; these realities do. Foremost among them are the power of incentives and the influence of supply and demand. The rules must be respected; they can’t be ignored, wished away, or overridden without consequences.**\n\nAnyone who thinks it’s better to live in a centrally planned economy that prefers evenly distributed benefits over free markets hasn’t studied history (or read _Animal Farm_). It may sound good in theory, but it has never worked. The laws of economics will always win out eventually. Nations can respect them and reap the associated benefits, or they can try to contravene them and pay the price in terms of underperformance.**In the world of politics, there can be limitless benefits and something for everyone. But in economics, there are only tradeoffs.**\n\nSeptember 19, 2024\n\nLegal Information and Disclosures\n\n _This memorandum expresses the views of the author as of the date indicated and such views are subject to change without notice.
