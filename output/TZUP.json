A technologist at heart, Robert learned to program a computer at 8 years old and by the time he was 12 years old, he purchased an Apple II and began his first technology company which game controllers for the brand-new Apple II computers, which were sold through local computer stores. \n\nAfter graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science from George Mason University, Robert and his co-founders created one of the first PC-based GIS systems (Graphical Information Systems) for the Fairfax County cable television system. This system was one of the first times that utility maps for an entire county could be edited and maintained on PC-based technology. \n\nIn 1999, Robert foresaw that in the future everyone would have a computer in their pocket in the form of a smartphone and founded iBrite, which designed groundbreaking mobile software. The patent application that Robert filed for iBrite has been citied more than 30 times and the iBrite software was used my Mapquest to put maps on a mobile device for the first time that we know of and was also used to put Microsoft Powerpoint on a Palm mobile device (which he believes was the first time this was done).\n\nRobert has been CEO of two publicly traded companies. One provided business process outsourcing services to Fortune 500 clients like Amgen, FedEx, GMAC and Ecolab (NYSE: ECL) and processed more than $1B a year in accounts payable transactions for Ecolab and scanned more than 30 million pages of loan documentation for GMAC. The other developed software that searches the Internet for copyright infringement and to date more than $1B in civil judgements have been awarded to copyright holders based on the case law that resulted from this technology.\n\n![Photo of Robert Haag](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/4ae2bc7f/dms3rep/multi/opt/ThumzupMedia-RobertHaag-1920w.png)\n\n## Robert Haag\n\nDirector\n\nRobert Haag is the Managing Member and sole owner of Westside Strategic Partners LLC, which is an investor in Thumzup Media Corporation.
