Leveraging data from nearly 17,000 of Udemy’s enterprise customers, this annual study explores the top themes and most in-demand skills shaping the future of learning and work. This year’s report found that as organizations continue to lean into generative AI (GenAI), they’re more invested in its specific, practical applications that will help maximize productivity, with a dual focus on soft skills development and leadership to guide employees through this shift successfully. \n\n“In 2025, we're all continuing to watch GenAI closely, expecting it to drive significant productivity gains, speed up skill-building, and fuel business growth faster than ever before,” said Greg Brown, President and CEO at Udemy. “Our data shows enterprises are looking for practical GenAI solutions that can be applied to daily operations, while also investing in soft skills and leadership development to help support the massive behavior change that this technology represents. Organizations best positioned for success will be those who embrace GenAI's positive impact on business outcomes, accelerating human potential, and closing key skills gaps to stay competitive.” \n\nUdemy identified three key areas of investment as companies begin assessing learning and development priorities for the year ahead: \n\n**1. Enterprises should build practical GenAI skills that drive applicable solutions.** Organizations are shifting their learning from GenAI’s fundamentals to practical applications so teams can implement the technology across operations, moving beyond its novelty to focus on more practical, real-world integrations into the daily flow of work. \n\n  * GenAI for productivity learning grew by**859%** year-over-year. \n  * LangChain, a framework enabling the integration of large language models into applications, surged **3,949%**. \n  * Multiple AI certification courses increased in consumption, including Microsoft Azure AI Engineer Associate **(311%)** and Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals **(197%)**. \n  * To date, GenAI courses on the Udemy platform have attracted more than **four million enrollments,** with **eight new enrollments** occurring every minute. \n\n\n\n**2. Soft skills must grow alongside GenAI competencies to supercharge creativity and collaboration.** By developing key soft skills in tandem with GenAI’s growth, enterprises can ensure new technologies are paired with human creativity and innovation. \n\n  * Enterprises are investing in skill sets like problem-solving**(103%)** , team building**(79%)** , and business communication **(41%)** , equipping employees to focus their newfound time saved by GenAI for more strategic, human-centric work. \n  * Not only do soft skills help workers unlock technology's greatest potential, but as [more enterprises](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Famazon-other-companies-return-to-office-mandate%2F&esheet=54152022&newsitemid=20241113118143&lan=en-US&anchor=more+enterprises&index=3&md5=a4665b2bc08b6f7b08eb1afaf77c2e30) encourage employees to return to the office in 2025, these skills can bridge communication gaps, increase collaboration, and foster in-person mentorship opportunities as teams adjust to in-person work, some for the very first time. \n\n\n\n**3. Leading by example will improve leadership’s role in change management and how employees perceive their guidance.** Leaders need to invest in these areas of change management and soft skills development, coupled with GenAI skills, to successfully lead employees in the AI-enabled era of work. \n\n  * Foundational leadership is **one of the top ten business skills consumed** on Udemy this year. \n  * Udemy’s [research](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.udemy.com%2Fresources%2Fgenerative-ai-perspectives-on-leadership%2F%3Futm_source%3Dorganic-referral%26utm_medium%3Dpress-release%26utm_campaign%3Dglstr2025&esheet=54152022&newsitemid=20241113118143&lan=en-US&anchor=research&index=4&md5=de3c8c2ddfcf3837bd31e690381ca87a) shows that nearly **nine out of 10 employees** believe their leadership team is critical to making GenAI transformation initiatives successful, but fewer than half **(48%)** believe their leaders are ready to lead these initiatives. \n\n\n\n“Learning and development leaders are moving beyond whether or not GenAI will transform enterprise learning; now, we’re focused on how we can harness the power of GenAI across diverse use cases to realize immediate business impact and uncover each employee’s potential,” said Jim Hemgen, Principal and Director of Talent Development at technology company Booz Allen Hamilton. “Investing in key skills like applying GenAI and leadership will help AI and human expertise work together to accelerate upskilling, make informed strategic decisions, and empower our workforce to thrive in a rapidly changing world.” \n\nTo read the full report, learn how organizations can leverage Udemy’s suite of GenAI-powered features, and explore programming built specifically for soft skills and leadership development, visit: [https://business.udemy.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.udemy.com%2F2025-global-learning-skills-trends-report%2F%3Futm_source%3Dorganic-referral%26utm_medium%3Dpress-release%26utm_campaign%3Dglstr2025&esheet=54152022&newsitemid=20241113118143&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.udemy.com&index=5&md5=b45f99a87739e248a940a0ff36de8173). \n\n**Methodology**\n\nFor this report, Udemy analyzed data from thousands of customers around the world.

As a result, we are raising our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA outlook.”\n\n“Longer-term, we remain focused on execution of our strategic initiatives, further optimizing our cost structure, and directing resources toward opportunities with the highest potential return. We believe these actions position Udemy to deliver high-quality, profitable growth and to lead the enterprise skills development category well into the future,” concluded Brown.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $195.4 million. Revenue growth includes a negative impact of 2 percentage points from changes in foreign exchange (FX) rates year-over-year.\n  * Enterprise segment, or Udemy Business, revenue of $126.1 million increased 16% year-over-year, including the negative impact of 2 percentage points from changes in FX rates year-over-year.\n  * Udemy Business Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) increased 14% year-over-year to $504.6 million.\n  * Consumer segment revenue of $69.3 million decreased 8% year-over-year, including the negative impact of 3 percentage points from changes in FX rates.\n  * Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities was $358.3 million at the end of the quarter.\n\n\n\n**Business and Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Added new, or expanded existing, relationships with Udemy Business customers globally, including ABB (Netherlands), Crédito Agricola (Portugal), Ericsson (Sweden), Infosys Limited (India), Marriott International (U.S.), Nationwide Building Society (UK), Primerica (U.S.), Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia), UnionDigital Bank (Philippines), Uniqlo Europe (UK), and West Japan Railway Company (Japan).\n  * Launched [new AI-enabled capabilities](https://investors.udemy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/udemy-launches-game-changing-ai-capabilities-transform-how) within Udemy’s _Intelligent Skills Platform_ , including AI Assistant, Skills Mapping and AI-powered learning paths that provide innovative, personalized learning experiences for organizations and individuals.\n  * Announced [Udemy’s new regional hub in Mexico City, Mexico](https://about.udemy.com/press-releases/udemy-announces-new-regional-hub-in-mexico-to-support-global-expansion-and-enhance-learning-experiences/) to enable scaling of operations and faster delivery of personalized, high-quality learning experiences to meet the evolving needs of organizations and professionals.\n  * Partnered with Workday to introduce a [new integration within Workday Skills Cloud](https://about.udemy.com/udemy-news/udemy-workday-skills-cloud-integration/) that enhances an organization’s ability to directly align learning with workforce development.\n\n\n\n**Share Repurchase Program** Udemy returned capital to shareholders through its $150 million share repurchase program. During Q3, the company spent approximately $51 million to buy back 6.3 million Udemy shares in the open market.\n\n**Financial Outlook** Udemy provides guidance based on current market conditions and expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the comments below regarding forward-looking statements.\n\nThe following table reflects Udemy’s financial outlook for its fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2024.\n\n**Three months ending December 31, 2024**| **Year ending December 31, 2024**  \n---|---  \nRevenue| $193 to $196 million| $780 to $783 million  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin1| Approximately 6.0%| Approximately 4.5%  \nWeighted Average Share Count, Basic2| 148 million| 151 million  \nWeighted Average Share Count, Diluted2| 149 million| 156 million  \n _1. Udemy has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) within this earnings release because the company is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to calculate certain reconciling items with confidence._ _2. Udemy’s outlook for weighted average share count, basic and diluted, excludes any impact from potential future repurchase activities under our share repurchase program._  \n  \nThe revenue guidance range above assumes historical changes in FX rates will have a negative 2 percentage point impact on fourth quarter year-over-year revenue growth and a negative 2 point impact on full year 2024 revenue growth. Udemy's revenue guidance assumes FX rates will remain unchanged from the end of the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Webcast Information** Udemy will host a conference call and webcast at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today, Tuesday, October 29, to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and outlook. A link to the live webcast and recorded replay of the conference call will be available on the “[Quarterly Results](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1UZ99hGmWjCTjLI_gFrEFfMdTtRDV1k5mc-2P6LqqXDHZ3lj6yjPcLWeiRlCdDOCbuEZ8dZ8Rg3hUrXiHu5dpJGJM4a5dP2LrUvSvWivqxC4UhD5NqHxz3PcYjFs2CLV17LKTnqHoSy6zIC1Zkw-SQ==)” section of Udemy’s Investor Relations website at [https://investors.udemy.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=suoUQe_auDNM1KsAcOQuiPZIU-EOGapPOvFeizx3t5tHgqfwALU-fnlWgPpsKeHO8mkyXdIP13ucS2pO9Poh3QHcWuPmgZGPmtclOUyR6sotbaZU8uhWmbc0clFlN_-o).

The archived replay of the webcast will be available for approximately one year.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined below. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results because our management team and board of directors use these non-GAAP financial measures for the purposes of assessing operating results and business planning. These non-GAAP financial measures also provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business by removing the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude i) interest income; ii) interest expense; iii) provision for income taxes; iv) depreciation and amortization; v) other expense, net, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency assets and liabilities into their functional currency; vi) stock-based compensation expense; and vii) restructuring charges. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We have not reconciled our expectations for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to net loss and net loss margin, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, because certain items are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted and a reconciliation for the guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n_Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share, Basic and Diluted_\n\nWe define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring charges.\n\nWe define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic, as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by weighted-average shares used to compute net loss per share, basic. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, diluted, as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by weighted-average shares used to compute net loss per share, diluted, which adjusts for the potentially dilutive effects of our employee equity incentive plans.\n\n_Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin_\n\nWe define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. We calculate non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue for the same period.\n\nUdemy’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein in conjunction with Udemy’s financial statements and the related notes thereto. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in this press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Key Business Metrics**\n\n_Udemy Business customers_\n\nWe count the total number of Udemy Business (“UB”) customers at the end of each period. To do so, we generally count unique customers using the concept of a domestic ultimate parent, defined as the highest business in the family tree that is in the same country as the contracted entity. In some cases, we deviate from this methodology, defining the contracted entity as a unique customer despite the existence of a domestic ultimate parent. This often occurs where the domestic ultimate parent is a financial owner, government entity, conglomerate, or acquisition target where we have contracted directly with the subsidiary. We define a UB customer as a customer who purchases Udemy via our direct sales force, reseller partnerships or through our self-service platform.\n\n_Udemy Business Annual Recurring Revenue_\n\nWe disclose our UB ARR as a measure of our Enterprise revenue growth. ARR represents the annualized value of our UB customer contracts on the last day of a given period. Only revenue from closed UB contracts with active seats as of the last day of the period are included.\n\n_Udemy Business Net Dollar Retention Rate and Udemy Business Large Customer Net Dollar Retention Rate_\n\nWe disclose UB Net Dollar Retention Rate, or UB NDRR, as a measure of revenue growth for all UB customers within our Enterprise segment, including UB Large Customers, which we define as companies with at least 1,000 employees. We calculate UB NDRR as the total ARR at the end of a trailing twelve-month period divided by the total ARR at the beginning of a trailing twelve-month period for the cohort of all UB customers active at the beginning of the trailing twelve-month period. We calculate UB Large Customer NDRR as the total UB Large Customer ARR at the end of a trailing twelve-month period divided by the total Large Customer ARR at the beginning of a trailing twelve-month period for the cohort of UB customers with at least 1,000 employees active at the beginning of the trailing twelve-month period. Total ARR and Large Customer ARR at the end of a trailing twelve-month period are calculated as ARR and Large Customer ARR, respectively, at the beginning of a trailing twelve-month period that are then adjusted for upsells, downsells, and churns for the same cohort of customers during that period. Large Customer ARR represents the annualized value of contracts for UB customers with active seats and having at least 1,000 employees on the last day of a given period.\n\n_Monthly average buyers_\n\nA buyer is a consumer who purchases a course or subscription through our direct-to-consumer offering. We first determine the number of monthly buyers by taking the total buyers of single courses during a given month plus the total active, paid consumer subscribers at any point in that month, adjusting for duplicate buyers that may be present in both totals. We then calculate monthly average buyers by taking an average of the monthly buyer totals over a particular period, such as a fiscal year. Our monthly average buyer count is not intended as a measure of active engagement, as not all buyers are active at any given time or over any given period.\n\n_Segment revenue and segment gross profit_\n\nSegment revenue represents the revenue recognized from our two segments, Enterprise (or Udemy Business), and Consumer. Segment gross profit is defined as segment revenue less segment cost of revenue, which include content costs, hosting and platform costs, customer support services, and payment processing fees that are allocable to each segment. Segment gross profit excludes amortization of capitalized software, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, and stock-based compensation allocated to cost of revenue as our chief operating decision maker does not include the information in his measurement of the performance of the operating segments.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
