\nOperating net income is a non-GAAP measure that is derived from net income adjusted for significant items. The Company believes that operating net income is useful in periods with certain significant items, such as listing-related, merger-related expenses, or Day 2 non-PCD provision. The operating net income is more reflective of management's ability to grow the business and manage expenses. Adjusted non-interest expense also removes these significant items such as listing-related and merger-related expenses. Management believes it represents a more normalized non-interest expense total for periods with identified significant items.\n\n**_Total Revenue (non-GAAP 1)_**  \n---  \n**For the three months ended**  \n**September 30** | **June 30** | **March 31** | **December 31** | **September 30**  \n**2024** | **2024** | **2024** | **2023** | **2023**  \nInterest income | $ 118,526 | $ 96,097 | $ 38,745 | $ 38,180 | $ 37,272  \nInterest expense | 45,347 | 36,332 | 16,614 | 15,876 | 14,383  \nNon-interest income | 10,616 | 9,505 | 4,254 | 4,824 | 4,289  \n**Total revenue (non-GAAP 1)** | **$ 83,795** | **$ 69,270** | **$ 26,385** | **$ 27,128** | **$ 27,178**  \n  \nTotal revenue is a non-GAAP measure and is derived from total interest income less total interest expense plus total non-interest income. We believe that total revenue is a useful tool to determine how the Company is managing its business and demonstrates how stable our revenue sources are from period to period.\n\n**_Pretax, Pre-Provision Earnings (non-GAAP 1)_**  \n---  \n**For the three months ended**  \n**September 30** | **June 30** | **March 31** | **December 31** | **September 30**  \n**2024** | **2024** | **2024** | **2023** | **2023**  \nIncome (loss) before taxes | $ 32,822 | $ (19,072) | $ 5,890 | $ 5,578 | $ 4,520  \nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses | 147 | 23,910 | (670) | (750) | 235  \n**Pretax, pre-provision earnings(non-GAAP 1)** | **$ 32,969** | **$ 4,838** | **$ 5,220** | **$ 4,828** | **$ 4,755**  \n  \nPretax, pre-provision earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is based on adjusting income before income taxes and to exclude provision for (recapture of) credit losses.

These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength because they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders' equity.\n\n**_Net Interest Margin & Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP1)_**  \n---  \n**As of or for the three months ended**  \n**September 30** | **June 30** | **March 31** | **December 31** | **September 30**  \n**2024** | **2024** | **2024** | **2023** | **2023**  \nNet interest income | $ 73,179 | $ 59,765 | $ 22,131 | $ 22,304 | $ 22,889  \nTaxable-equivalent adjustments | 847 | 688 | 362 | 365 | 366  \n**Net interest income(Fully Taxable-Equivalent - FTE)** | **$ 74,026** | **$ 60,453** | **$ 22,493** | **$ 22,669** | **$ 23,255**  \nAverage interest-earning assets | $ 7,238,636 | $ 5,994,383 | $ 3,377,092 | $ 3,332,733 | $ 3,337,282  \n**Net interest margin (non-GAAP 1)** | **4.07 %** | **4.06 %** | **2.68 %** | **2.70 %** | **2.76 %**  \n  \nThe interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest income, we use net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. FTE net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit on certain financial interest earning assets, whose interest is tax-exempt, to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. Management believes FTE net interest income is a standard practice in the banking industry, and when net interest income is adjusted on an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income and this adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. FTE net interest income is only used for calculating FTE net interest margin, which is calculated by annualizing FTE net interest income and then dividing by the average earning assets. The tax rate used for this adjustment is 21%. Net interest income shown elsewhere in this presentation is GAAP net interest income.\n\n1 Non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this release are used by management to measure performance in operating the business that management believes enhances investors' ability to better understand the underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables in this release. Non-GAAP measures should not be used as a substitute for the closest comparable GAAP measurements.2 September 30, 2024, are estimated.3 Includes Federal Home Loan Bank, Borrower-in-Custody (BIC), and correspondent bank availability.4 Weighted average diluted shares for Q2 2024 calculated only for computation of adjusted diluted EPS. Weighted average diluted shares for GAAP diluted EPS are the same as shares for calculating basic EPS due to the antidilutive effect of the diluted shares when considering the GAAP net loss for the quarter.  \n---  \n  \nCONTACT:Investor Relations703-666-3555 bhfsir@burkeandherbertbank.com\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=PH38897&sd=2024-10-25) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/burke--herbert-financial-services-corp-announces-third-quarter-2024-results-and-increases-common-stock-dividend-302287279.html>\n\nSOURCE Burke & Herbert Financial Services Corp.\n\n[View All News](https://investor.burkeandherbertbank.com/news/Press-Releases/default.aspx)\n"

adjusted for significant items. The Company believes that operating net income is useful in periods with certain significant items, such as listing-related, merger-related expenses, or Day 2 non-PCD provision. The operating net income is more reflective of management's ability to grow the business and manage expenses. Adjusted non-interest expense also removes these significant items such as listing-related and merger-related expenses. Management believes it represents a more normalized non-interest expense total for periods with identified significant items.\n\n**_Total Revenue (non-GAAP)_**  \n---  \n**For the three months ended**  \n**June 30** | **March 31** | **December 31** | **September 30** | **June 30**  \n**2024** | **2024** | **2023** | **2023** | **2023**  \nInterest income | $ 96,097 | $ 38,745 | $ 38,180 | $ 37,272 | $ 37,116  \nInterest expense | 36,332 | 16,614 | 15,876 | 14,383 | 13,324  \nNon-interest income | 9,505 | 4,254 | 4,824 | 4,289 | 4,625  \n**Total revenue (non-GAAP)** | **$ 69,270** | **$ 26,385** | **$ 27,128** | **$ 27,178** | **$ 28,417**  \n  \nTotal revenue is a non-GAAP measure and is derived from total interest income less total interest expense plus total non-interest income. We believe that total revenue is a useful tool to determine how the Company is managing its business and demonstrates how stable our revenue sources are from period to period.\n\n**_Pretax, Pre-Provision Earnings (non-GAAP)_**  \n---  \n**For the three months ended**  \n**June 30** | **March 31** | **December 31** | **September 30** | **June 30**  \n**2024** | **2024** | **2023** | **2023** | **2023**  \nIncome (loss) before taxes | $ (19,072) | $ 5,890 | $ 5,578 | $ 4,520 | $ 6,855  \nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses | 23,910 | (670) | (750) | 235 | 214  \n**Pretax, pre-provision earnings (non-GAAP)** | **$ 4,838** | **$ 5,220** | **$ 4,828** | **$ 4,755** | **$ 7,069**  \n  \nPretax, pre-provision earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is based on adjusting income before income taxes and to exclude provision for (recapture of) credit losses. We believe that pretax, pre-provision earnings is a useful tool to help evaluate the ability to provide for credit costs through operations and provides an additional basis to compare results between periods by isolating the impact of provision for (recapture of) credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods.\n\n**_Tangible Common Equity (non-GAAP)_**  \n---  \n**For the three months ended**  \n**June 30** | **March 31** | **December 31** | **September 30** | **June 30**  \nActual balances | **2024** | **2024** | **2023** | **2023** | **2023**  \nCommon shareholders' equity | $ 682,713 | $ 319,308 | $ 314,750 | $ 270,819 | $ 290,072  \nLess:  \nIntangible assets | 65,895 | — | — | — | —  \nGoodwill | 32,783 | — | — | — | —  \nTangible common equity (non-GAAP) | $ 584,035 | $ 319,308 | $ 314,750 | $ 270,819 | $ 290,072  \nShares outstanding at end of period | 14,932,169 | 7,440,025 | 7,428,710 | 7,428,710 | 7,428,710  \n**Tangible book value per common share** | **$ 39.11** | **$ 42.92** | **$ 42.37** | **$ 36.46** | **$ 39.05**  \n  \nIn management's view, tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the Company, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Company's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. These non-GAAP measures are valuable indicators of a financial institution's capital strength because they eliminate intangible assets from stockholders' equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders' equity.\n\n**_Net Interest Margin & Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP)_**  \n---  \n**As of or for the three months ended**  \n**June 30** | **March 31** | **December 31** | **September 30** | **June 30**  \n**2024** | **2024** | **2023** | **2023** | **2023**  \nNet interest income | $ 59,765 | $ 22,131 | $ 22,304 | $ 22,889 | $ 23,792  \nTaxable-equivalent adjustments | 688 | 362 | 365 | 366 | 375  \n**Net interest income (Fully Taxable-Equivalent - FTE)** | **$ 60,453** | **$ 22,493** | **$ 22,669** | **$ 23,255** | **$ 24,167**  \nAverage earning assets | $ 5,994,383 | $ 3,377,092 | $ 3,332,733 | $ 3,337,282 | $ 3,379,534  \n**Net interest margin (non-GAAP)** | **4.06 %** | **2.68 %** | **2.70 %** | **2.76 %** | **2.87 %**  \n  \nThe interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest income, we use net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. FTE net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit on certain financial interest earning assets, whose interest is tax-exempt, to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. Management believes FTE net interest income is a standard practice in the banking industry, and when net interest income is adjusted on an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income and this adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. FTE net interest income is only used for calculating FTE net interest margin, which is calculated by annualizing FTE net interest income and then dividing by the average earning assets. The tax-rate used for this adjustment is 21%. Net interest income shown elsewhere in this presentation is GAAP net interest income.\n\n1 Non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this release are used by management to measure performance in operating the business that management believes enhances investors' ability to better understand the underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. Reconciliations of non-GAAP operating measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables in this release. Non-GAAP measures should not be used as a substitute for the closest comparable GAAP measurements.  \n---  \n2 Refers to the initial increase in allowance for credit losses required on acquired non-PCD loans through the provision for credit losses.  \n3 Estimated.  \n4 Estimated.  \n5 Includes Federal Home Loan Bank, Borrower-in-Custody (BIC), and correspondent bank availability.  \n6 Estimated.  \n7 Weighted average diluted shares for Q2 2024 calculated only for computation of adjusted diluted EPS. Weighted average diluted shares for GAAP diluted EPS are the same as shares for calculating basic EPS due to the antidilutive effect of the diluted shares when considering the GAAP net loss for the quarter.  \n  \nCONTACT:Investor Relations703-666-3555 bhfsir@burkeandherbertbank.com\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=PH70036&sd=2024-07-26) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/burke--herbert-financial-services-corp-announces-second-quarter-2024-results-and-declares-common-stock-dividend-302207240.html>\n\nSOURCE Burke & Herbert Financial Services Corp.\n\n[View All News](https://investor.burkeandherbertbank.com/news/Press-Releases/default.aspx)\n"
