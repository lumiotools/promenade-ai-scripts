(NASDAQ: ANGO), a leading and transformative medical technology company focused on restoring healthy blood flow in the body’s vascular system, expanding cancer treatment options and improving patient quality of life, today announced the launch of an international multi-center prospective registry study to assess the long term effects of treating men with unifocal intermediate-risk prostate cancer with the NanoKnife® System in partnership with the University College London Hospital (UCLH). \n\nApproximately 40% of all diagnosed prostate cancer cases are classified as intermediate risk.1 In the first year after surgery, 36% of men report urinary leakage, and 95% are affected by erectile dysfunction (70% described as moderate/severe).2\n\nThe NanoKnife® System delivers an innovative alternative to conventional radical surgery or radiotherapy, each of which often results in significant dysfunction in urinary continence and erectile potency. With its non-thermal approach, the NanoKnife system is engineered to preserve vital structures inside and outside the prostate, offering patients effective treatment of tumors, low complication rates, and minimal impact on quality of life.3\n\nIn 2023, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the U.K. upgraded the use of the NanoKnife® System from “Research Only” to “Special Arrangements” allowing hospitals to start new services while collecting more data4 and signaling its growing acceptance in national urology guidelines. \n\nAngioDynamics is conducting the international multi-center prospective registry study in partnership with UCLH. UCLH is the largest center for robotic prostate surgery in the U.K. and a leading provider of focal therapy, radiotherapy, robotic surgery, and active surveillance treatment options for men with prostate cancer. Additionally, UCLH was the first facility in the National Health Service to use the NanoKnife® System to treat prostate cancer,5 and provide standardized patient selection, treatment, and long-term follow-up. \n\n“Focal therapy has developed over the past ten years to identify patients with the most to gain from treatment effectively. We can now test a large cohort of patients to show benefit without adding long-term risk,” said Laura Piccinini, AngioDynamics Senior Vice President and General Manager of Endovascular Therapies and International. “We are proud of the partnership with UCLH in conducting this important study. This extensive prospective study will help support broader adoption, expanded treatment pathways, and increased patient access to improved treatment modalities for men in the U.K. with prostate cancer and help establish treatment with this technology as a standard of care. This collaboration demonstrates our steadfast commitment to supporting the physician community and their patients with innovative and effective products.” \n\n“The international registry will allow us to track patients’ outcomes over time and allow us to quality control the dissemination of this novel technology across the world,” said Professor Mark Emberton, Interventional Oncology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science at the University College Hospital London. “This will enable us to learn from every patient treated and, as a result, continue to refine this treatment that allows men to have their prostate cancer treated and maintain their quality of life.” \n\nThe study will enroll a minimum of 500 patients worldwide to confirm the multiple single-center published papers indicating that the NanoKnife® System is safe and effective in the treatment of targeted tumors,3 and the prevention or delayed need for radical intervention in the preservation of patient quality of life. \n\nComplementing the ongoing Randomized Controlled Trial studies evaluating NanoKnife versus radical treatment,6,7 this investigator-initiated trial will closely monitor patients post-treatment, measuring critical quality of life metrics and tracking any necessary follow-up interventions. In addition to quality of life, the study will assess overall and prostate-specific mortality rates. \n\nFor important risk information, visit [https://www.angiodynamics.com/about-us/risk-information/#inano](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angiodynamics.com%2Fabout-us%2Frisk-information%2F%23inano&esheet=54140703&newsitemid=20241023861610&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.angiodynamics.com%2Fabout-us%2Frisk-information%2F%23inano&index=1&md5=f215aaeefe0124f7c00889a9e5b62867)\n\n**About the NanoKnife System**\n\nThe NanoKnife System utilizes Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) technology to effectively destroy targeted cells without the use of thermal energy by delivering high-voltage pulses, creating permanent nanopores within the cell membrane. This stimulus induces an apoptotic-like cellular death in the targeted tissue, resulting in a complete ablation of the targeted tissue.

Gross margin for the Med Device business was 48.2%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to inflationary pressures and costs associated with the transition to outsourced manufacturing. \n\nThe Company recorded a GAAP net loss of $12.8 million, or a loss per share of $0.31, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Excluding the items shown in the non-GAAP reconciliation table below, adjusted net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $4.4 million, or a loss per share of $0.11. This compares to an adjusted net loss during the fiscal first quarter of 2024 of $6.2 million, or a loss per share of $0.16. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, excluding the items shown in the non-GAAP reconciliation table below, was $(0.2) million, compared to $(1.1) million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company used $18.3 million in operating cash. The Company’s first fiscal quarter has historically exhibited the highest utilization of cash and the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was in line with the Company’s expectations. \n\nAt August 31, 2024, the Company had $55.0 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $76.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at May 31, 2024. \n\n**NanoKnife System's PRESERVE Study Results Submitted for FDA 510(k) Clearance**\n\nIn September, the Company submitted results from its Pivotal Study of the NanoKnife System for Ablation of Prostate Tissue in an Intermediate-Risk Patient Population (PRESERVE) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 510(k) indication of its NanoKnife System in the ablation of prostate tissue in an intermediate-risk population. The comprehensive study enrolled and treated 121 patients across 17 facilities throughout the United States. \n\n**CE Mark Approval in Europe for the Auryon System**\n\nPrior to the end of the quarter AngioDynamics received European CE Mark approval for its Auryon Atherectomy System. This regulatory approval allows AngioDynamics to market the Auryon System in Europe for the treatment of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), including Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) and In-Stent Restenosis (ISR). The Auryon System uses solid-state laser technology to treat PAD lesions and occlusions. It has been cleared by the FDA since 2020 and has treated over 50,000 patients in the United States. The system is designed to treat lesions of various types, lengths, and locations, both above and below the knee. This CE Mark approval expands AngioDynamics' potential market reach, as the global PAD market is valued at $1.1 billion. \n\n**RECOVER-AV Clinical Trial**\n\nSubsequent to the end of the first fiscal quarter, the Company initiated its RECOVER-AV clinical trial, marking a significant step in evaluating the AlphaVac F18⁸⁵ System for treating acute, intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) in the European market. This multi-center, multi-national study will assess the efficacy, safety, and long-term functional outcomes of the system across up to 20 hospital sites in Europe. Following the successful APEX-AV study in the United States, RECOVER-AV aims to further demonstrate the system's capabilities in a region where PE prevalence is notably higher. The trial will track patient outcomes over a 12-month period, focusing on key efficacy and safety endpoints. \n\n**Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Guidance**\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, the Company continues to expect: \n\n  * Net sales to be in the range of $282 to $288 million, representing growth of between 4.2% – 6.4% over fiscal 2024 pro forma revenue of $270.7 million\n  * Med Tech net sales are expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12% \n  * Med Device net sales are expected to grow in the range of 1% to 3% \n  * Gross margin to be approximately 52% to 53% \n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.5 million to $0, compared to a pro forma adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.2 million in fiscal year 2024 \n  * Adjusted loss per share in the range of $0.38 to $0.42, compared to pro forma adjusted loss per share of $0.45 in fiscal year 2024 \n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company’s management will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET the same day to discuss the results.

Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In this news release, AngioDynamics has reported pro forma results, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. Management uses these measures in its internal analysis and review of operational performance. Management believes that these measures provide investors with useful information in comparing AngioDynamics' performance over different periods. By using these non-GAAP measures, management believes that investors get a better picture of the performance of AngioDynamics' underlying business. Management encourages investors to review AngioDynamics' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP to understand AngioDynamics' performance taking into account all relevant factors, including those that may only occur from time to time but have a material impact on AngioDynamics' financial results.
