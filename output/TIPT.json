Adjusted net income is presented before the impacts of non-controlling interests.   \n  \n  * Tiptree Capital loss before taxes was $2.7 million for the quarter, compared to a loss of $6.1 million in Q3'23, driven by unrealized investment losses. For the year, income before taxes was $1.8 million, compared to a loss of $4.5 million in 2023, with the comparative improvement driven by gains on securities in the Company’s investment holdings and a reduction of investment losses on Invesque. \n\n\n  * Mortgage loss before taxes was $0.1 million for the quarter, as compared to an income of $0.4 million in Q3'23, and an income of $1.2 million for the year, as compared to a loss of $0.9 million in 2023, driven by higher origination volumes and loan servicing fees, partially offset by unrealized losses on our mortgage servicing asset. \n\n\n\n**Corporate:**\n\nCorporate includes expenses of the holding company for employee compensation and benefits, audit and professional fees, and public company and other expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were $7.7 million compared to $8.4 million in Q3'23 driven by decreased professional fees, lease and insurance expense. \n\n**_Non-GAAP_ **\n\nManagement uses Adjusted net income and Adjusted return on average equity as measurements of operating performance. Management believes these measures provide supplemental information useful to investors as they are frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance and comparison among companies. Management uses Adjusted net income and adjusted return on average equity as part of its capital allocation process and to assess comparative returns on invested capital. Adjusted net income represents income before taxes, less provision (benefit) for income taxes, and excluding the after-tax impact of various expenses that we consider to be unique and non-recurring in nature, stock-based compensation, net realized and unrealized gains (losses), and intangibles amortization associated with purchase accounting, all of which is reduced for non-controlling interests. Adjusted net income and Adjusted return on average equity are presented before the impacts of non-controlling interests. Adjusted net income and Adjusted return on average equity are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP net income. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for a reconciliation of these measures to their GAAP equivalents. \n\n** Earnings Conference Call **\n\nTiptree will host a conference call on Thursday, October 31, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its Q3 2024 financial results.

Inc.** **Non-GAAP Reconciliations (Unaudited)**\n\n** Non-GAAP Financial Measures — Adjusted net income and Adjusted return on average equity **\n\nAdjusted net income is defined as income before taxes, less provision (benefit) for income taxes, and excluding the after-tax impact of various expenses that we consider to be unique and non-recurring in nature, including merger and acquisition related expenses, stock-based compensation, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) and intangibles amortization associated with purchase accounting, all of which is reduced for non-controlling interests. The calculation of adjusted net income excludes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) that relate to investments or assets rather than business operations. Adjusted net income is presented before the impacts of non-controlling interests. Adjusted return on average equity represents adjusted net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders’ equity during the period. Management uses Adjusted net income and adjusted return on average equity as part of its capital allocation process and to assess comparative returns on invested capital. We believe adjusted net income provides additional clarity on the results of the Company’s underlying business operations as a whole for the periods presented by excluding distortions created by the unpredictability and volatility of realized and unrealized gains (losses). We also believe adjusted net income provides useful supplemental information to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance between periods and for comparison among companies. \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Tiptree Capital**  \n_($ in thousands)_ |  **Insurance** |  **Mortgage** |  **Other** |  **Corporate** |

The calculation of adjusted net income excludes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) that relate to investments or assets rather than business operations. Adjusted net income should not be\nviewed as a substitute for income before taxes calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define adjusted net income differently. Adjusted net income (before NCI) is presented before the impacts of\nnon-controlling interests.\nWe present adjustments for amortization associated with acquired intangible assets. The intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting in connection with Tiptree’s acquisition of Fortegra Financial in\n2014, Defend in 2019, and Smart AutoCare and Sky Auto in 2020, ITC in 2022 and Premia in 2023. The intangible assets acquired contribute to overall revenue generation, and the respective purchase accounting\nadjustments will continue to occur in future periods until such intangible assets are fully amortized in accordance with the respective amortization periods required by GAAP.\nWe define adjusted return on average equity as adjusted net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholder’s equity during the period. We use adjusted return on\naverage equity as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our results of\noperations and our underlying business performance. Adjusted return on average equity should not be viewed as a substitute for return on average equity calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may\ndefine adjusted return on average equity differently.\nBook value per share\nManagement believes the use of book value per share provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequentlyused by the financial community to analyze company growth on a relative per share basis.\nInsurance – Underwriting and Fee Revenues\nWe generally manage our exposure to the underwriting risk we assume using both reinsurance (e.g., quota share and excess of loss) and retrospective commission agreements with our partners (e.g., commissions paid\nare adjusted based on the actual underlying losses incurred), which mitigate our risk. Period-over-period comparisons of revenues and expenses are often impacted by the Producer Owned Reinsurance Company\n(PORCs) and distribution partners’ choice as to whether to retain risk, specifically service and administration fees and ceding commissions, both components of revenue, and policy and contract benefits and commissions\npaid to our partners and reinsurers. Generally, when losses are incurred, the risk which is retained by our partners and reinsurers is reflected in a reduction in commissions paid. In order to better explain to investors the\nunderwriting performance of the Company’s programs and the respective retentions between the Company and its agents and reinsurance partners, we use non-GAAP metrics of underwriting and fee revenues and\nunderwriting and fee margin.\nWe define underwriting and fee revenues as total revenues excluding net investment income, net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses), ceding fees, ceding commissions and cash and cash equivalent\ninterest income as reported in other income. Underwriting and fee revenues represents revenues generated by our underwriting and fee-based operations and allows us to evaluate our underwriting performance without\nregard to investment income. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our underlying business performance. Underwriting and fee revenues\nshould not be viewed as a substitute for total revenues calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting and fee revenues differently.\nInsurance -Underwriting and Fee Margin\nWe define underwriting and fee margin as income before taxes, excluding net investment income, net realized gains (losses), net unrealized gains (losses), cash and cash equivalent interest income, employee\ncompensation and benefits, other expenses, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Underwriting and fee margin represents the underwriting performance of our underwriting and fee-based programs. As\nsuch, underwriting and fee margin excludes general administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other corporate expenses as those expenses support the vertically integrated business\nmodel and not any individual component of our business mix. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into the specific performance of our\nunderlying underwriting and fee programs. Underwriting and fee income should not be viewed as a substitute for income before taxes calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting\nand fee margin differently.\n14\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations – Underwriting & Fee Revenues & Margin\n15\n( $ in th o u s a n d s , e x c e p t p e r s h a r e in fo r m a tio n\nT o ta l R e v e n u e s\nL e s s : N e t in v e s tm e n t in c o m e\nL e s s : N e t r e a liz e d a n d u n r e a liz e d g a in s ( lo s s e\nL e s s : C e d in g f e e s\nL e s s : C e d in g c o m m is s io n s\nL e s s : C a s h a n d c a s h e q u iv a le n t in te r e s t in c o m\nU n d e r w r it in g a n d f e e r e v e n u e s -

Adjusted net income is presented before the impacts of non-controlling interests.   \n  \n  * Tiptree Capital loss before taxes was $2.7 million for the quarter, compared to a loss of $6.1 million in Q3'23, driven by unrealized investment losses. For the year, income before taxes was $1.8 million, compared to a loss of $4.5 million in 2023, with the comparative improvement driven by gains on securities in the Company’s investment holdings and a reduction of investment losses on Invesque. \n\n\n  * Mortgage loss before taxes was $0.1 million for the quarter, as compared to an income of $0.4 million in Q3'23, and an income of $1.2 million for the year, as compared to a loss of $0.9 million in 2023, driven by higher origination volumes and loan servicing fees, partially offset by unrealized losses on our mortgage servicing asset. \n\n\n\n**Corporate:**\n\nCorporate includes expenses of the holding company for employee compensation and benefits, audit and professional fees, and public company and other expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were $7.7 million compared to $8.4 million in Q3'23 driven by decreased professional fees, lease and insurance expense. \n\n**_Non-GAAP_ **\n\nManagement uses Adjusted net income and Adjusted return on average equity as measurements of operating performance. Management believes these measures provide supplemental information useful to investors as they are frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance and comparison among companies. Management uses Adjusted net income and adjusted return on average equity as part of its capital allocation process and to assess comparative returns on invested capital. Adjusted net income represents income before taxes, less provision (benefit) for income taxes, and excluding the after-tax impact of various expenses that we consider to be unique and non-recurring in nature, stock-based compensation, net realized and unrealized gains (losses), and intangibles amortization associated with purchase accounting, all of which is reduced for non-controlling interests. Adjusted net income and Adjusted return on average equity are presented before the impacts of non-controlling interests. Adjusted net income and Adjusted return on average equity are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP net income. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for a reconciliation of these measures to their GAAP equivalents. \n\n** Earnings Conference Call **\n\nTiptree will host a conference call on Thursday, October 31, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its Q3 2024 financial results.

Inc.** **Non-GAAP Reconciliations (Unaudited)**\n\n** Non-GAAP Financial Measures — Adjusted net income and Adjusted return on average equity **\n\nAdjusted net income is defined as income before taxes, less provision (benefit) for income taxes, and excluding the after-tax impact of various expenses that we consider to be unique and non-recurring in nature, including merger and acquisition related expenses, stock-based compensation, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) and intangibles amortization associated with purchase accounting, all of which is reduced for non-controlling interests. The calculation of adjusted net income excludes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) that relate to investments or assets rather than business operations. Adjusted net income is presented before the impacts of non-controlling interests. Adjusted return on average equity represents adjusted net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders’ equity during the period. Management uses Adjusted net income and adjusted return on average equity as part of its capital allocation process and to assess comparative returns on invested capital. We believe adjusted net income provides additional clarity on the results of the Company’s underlying business operations as a whole for the periods presented by excluding distortions created by the unpredictability and volatility of realized and unrealized gains (losses). We also believe adjusted net income provides useful supplemental information to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance between periods and for comparison among companies. \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Tiptree Capital**  \n_($ in thousands)_ |  **Insurance** |  **Mortgage** |  **Other** |  **Corporate** |

The calculation of adjusted net income excludes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) that relate to investments or assets rather than business operations. Adjusted net income should not be\nviewed as a substitute for income before taxes calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define adjusted net income differently. Adjusted net income (before NCI) is presented before the impacts of\nnon-controlling interests.\nWe present adjustments for amortization associated with acquired intangible assets. The intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting in connection with Tiptree’s acquisition of Fortegra Financial in\n2014, Defend in 2019, and Smart AutoCare and Sky Auto in 2020, ITC in 2022 and Premia in 2023. The intangible assets acquired contribute to overall revenue generation, and the respective purchase accounting\nadjustments will continue to occur in future periods until such intangible assets are fully amortized in accordance with the respective amortization periods required by GAAP.\nWe define adjusted return on average equity as adjusted net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholder’s equity during the period. We use adjusted return on\naverage equity as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our results of\noperations and our underlying business performance. Adjusted return on average equity should not be viewed as a substitute for return on average equity calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may\ndefine adjusted return on average equity differently.\nBook value per share\nManagement believes the use of book value per share provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequentlyused by the financial community to analyze company growth on a relative per share basis.\nInsurance – Underwriting and Fee Revenues\nWe generally manage our exposure to the underwriting risk we assume using both reinsurance (e.g., quota share and excess of loss) and retrospective commission agreements with our partners (e.g., commissions paid\nare adjusted based on the actual underlying losses incurred), which mitigate our risk. Period-over-period comparisons of revenues and expenses are often impacted by the Producer Owned Reinsurance Company\n(PORCs) and distribution partners’ choice as to whether to retain risk, specifically service and administration fees and ceding commissions, both components of revenue, and policy and contract benefits and commissions\npaid to our partners and reinsurers. Generally, when losses are incurred, the risk which is retained by our partners and reinsurers is reflected in a reduction in commissions paid. In order to better explain to investors the\nunderwriting performance of the Company’s programs and the respective retentions between the Company and its agents and reinsurance partners, we use non-GAAP metrics of underwriting and fee revenues and\nunderwriting and fee margin.\nWe define underwriting and fee revenues as total revenues excluding net investment income, net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses), ceding fees, ceding commissions and cash and cash equivalent\ninterest income as reported in other income. Underwriting and fee revenues represents revenues generated by our underwriting and fee-based operations and allows us to evaluate our underwriting performance without\nregard to investment income. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our underlying business performance. Underwriting and fee revenues\nshould not be viewed as a substitute for total revenues calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting and fee revenues differently.\nInsurance -Underwriting and Fee Margin\nWe define underwriting and fee margin as income before taxes, excluding net investment income, net realized gains (losses), net unrealized gains (losses), cash and cash equivalent interest income, employee\ncompensation and benefits, other expenses, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Underwriting and fee margin represents the underwriting performance of our underwriting and fee-based programs. As\nsuch, underwriting and fee margin excludes general administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other corporate expenses as those expenses support the vertically integrated business\nmodel and not any individual component of our business mix. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into the specific performance of our\nunderlying underwriting and fee programs.
