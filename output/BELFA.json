(Nasdaq: BELFA and BELFB) today announced preliminary financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales of $123.6 million compared to $158.7 million in Q3-23\n  * Gross profit margin of 36.1%, up from 35.0% in Q3-23\n  * Net earnings of $8.1 million versus $19.4 million in Q3-23\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $20.6 million (16.7% of sales) as compared to $29.9 million (18.8% of sales) in Q3-23\n  * Repurchased 26,647 shares of Bel stock at an aggregate cost of $1.9 million in Q3-24\n\n\n\n‚ÄúWe were pleased that our third quarter results landed above the midpoint of guidance for both sales and gross margin,‚Äù said Daniel Bernstein, President and CEO. ‚ÄúEach of our three product segments performed as expected, given the current market, regulatory and seasonal factors outlined in last quarter's disclosures and on the Q2 earnings call.\n\n‚ÄúDuring the third quarter, the team focused on a variety of operational and other internal initiatives. With our announcement of the signing our definitive purchase agreement in September, we welcomed Enercon to the Bel family and are positioned to introduce new customers, end markets and geographies to our Power segment upon the closing expected later this quarter. In a project scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of 2025, our fuse manufacturing, located in China, will be consolidated into other existing Bel facilities thus reducing our footprint further. The fuse initiative is anticipated to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $1.5 million once completed. We are also pleased to announce the addition of two senior associates in newly-created positions to Bel‚Äôs corporate team. Uma Pengali has joined as Global Head of Sales and Marketing and Anubhav Gothi has joined as Bel‚Äôs Global Head of Contracts. We believe Uma and Anubhav will be instrumental contributors to Bel‚Äôs long-term success,‚Äù concluded Mr. Bernstein.\n\nFarouq Tuweiq, CFO, added, ‚ÄúWe have started to see positive trends in bookings during the months of September and October across each of our product segments, which is a positive indicator as we enter 2025. These green shoots are largely in our networking and industrial markets, and in the distribution channel. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect GAAP net sales in the range of $117 to $125 million with gross margins of approximately 34 - 36%, based on information available as of today. This guidance excludes any potential incremental contribution related to the previously-announced acquisition of Enercon, which is expected to close during the fourth quarter.\n\n‚ÄúOverall, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in market conditions that we are seeing and believe this will bode well for 2025. We are excited to continue our journey of growth and continuous improvement with our new team members,‚Äù concluded Mr. Tuweiq.\n\n_Non-GAAP financial measures, such as Non-GAAP net earnings, Non-GAAP EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, adjust corresponding GAAP measures for provision for income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization, and also exclude, where applicable for the covered period presented in the financial statements, certain unusual or special items identified by management such as restructuring charges, gains/losses on sales of businesses and properties, acquisition related costs, and_  _certain litigation costs_.  _Non-GAAP adjusted net sales exclude expedite fee revenue. Please refer to the financial information included with this press release for reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to Non-GAAP financial measures and our explanation of why we present Non-GAAP financial measures._\n\n**Conference Call** Bel has scheduled a conference call for 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, October 24, 2024 to discuss these results.

Bel anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its views to change. Bel undertakes no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Bel‚Äôs views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** The Non-GAAP financial measures identified in this press release as well as in the supplementary information to this press release (Non-GAAP adjusted net sales, Non-GAAP net earnings, Non-GAAP EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). These measures should not be considered a substitute for, and the reader should also consider, income from operations, net earnings, earnings per share and other measures of performance as defined by GAAP as indicators of our performance or profitability. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled captions of other companies due to differences in the method of calculation. We present results adjusted to exclude the effects of certain unusual or special items and their related tax impact that would otherwise be included under U.S. GAAP, to aid in comparisons with other periods. We believe that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. We use these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company‚Äôs performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis and for budgeting and planning purposes. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company‚Äôs financial measures with other similarly situated companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. We also use non-GAAP measures in determining incentive compensation. For additional information about our use of non-GAAP financial measures in connection with our Incentive Compensation Program for 2023, please see the Executive Compensation discussion appearing in our Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024.\n\n**Website Information** We routinely post important information for investors on our website, www.belfuse.com, in the \"Investor Relations\" section. We use our website as a means of disclosing material, otherwise non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following our press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts.
