Starting in November, the Company recently launched its new ION 135 Watt Under Canopy LED Light, designed to help cultivators improve their harvest quality, increase yields and to grow more profitably. \n\nComing in December, GrowGen expects to launch new essential accessories lines of pest management traps under The Harvest Company brand, as well as a new line of Char Coir Crush Pots in its grow medium products category.

In particular, we exceeded our near-term targets for proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales, which grew to 23.8%, compared to 19.4% for the third quarter last year. This is tracking well against our goal to grow proprietary brand sales to 35% in 2025. Additionally, same-store sales grew 12.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, reflecting the strong performance of our core store locations as we right-size our retail footprint. In addition, we met our store closures target, even as we maintained our focus on improving efficiencies, reducing store and other operating expenses by 13.9% during the quarter. Our financial position also remains strong, with $55.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and no debt.” \n\n“Our same-store sales growth, reduction in expenses and the improvement in our proprietary brand sales all demonstrate, our actions to date have proven successful in positioning GrowGen for sustainable growth in 2025. In line with these priorities, we are also on track to launch our e-commerce portal in the fourth quarter of this year, which is a key part of our digital transformation and B2B customer focus. We are well-positioned in the industry to capitalize on growth opportunities, and our restructuring plan has put us on a stronger footing to drive revenue growth, optimize margins, and build a leaner, more profitable company,” added Mr. Lampert. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results**\n\nNet sales declined $5.7 million, or 10.2%, to $50.0 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $55.7 million for the third quarter 2023. \n\nThe decrease in net sales was primarily related to our Cultivation and Gardening segment, which had net sales of $41.4 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $48.0 million for the same prior year period. Cultivation and Gardening’s decrease in net sales was primarily driven by the fiscal 2023 consolidation of 6 retail locations after the third quarter 2023 in addition to 19 retail locations to date in fiscal 2024, which include the 12 redundant or underperforming retail locations consolidated in conjunction with our strategic restructuring plan announced in July 2024. Additionally, we estimate that sales discounts offered as part of our strategic restructuring plan at those 12 retail locations negatively impacted net sales by approximately $0.9 million in the third quarter 2024. Cultivation and Gardening’s same-store sales increased 12.5%, primarily attributable to commercial sales growth, customer retention in markets where there were retail location closures, and improvements in our e-commerce site sales volume. Proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales for the third quarter 2024 increased to 23.8% as compared to 19.4% for the same prior year period largely driven by our strategic initiatives to increase sales volume with our expanded portfolio of proprietary brands and products and various proprietary product launches. The percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales related to consumable products remained relatively flat at 73.3% and 73.5% for the third quarter 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nAdditionally, net sales of commercial fixtures within our Storage Solutions segment increased by 12.9% to $8.6 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $7.6 million for the year ago period, primarily due to increased demand from retail customers and timing differences of various projects being pushed into the third quarter of 2024 from the prior quarter. \n\nGross profit was $10.8 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $16.2 million for the third quarter 2023, a decrease of $5.4 million or 33.2%. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by our Cultivation and Gardening segment, which decreased $5.5 million, or 43.3%, largely as a result of the 25 store consolidations since the end of the third quarter 2023 as well as the effects of our strategic restructuring plan, which include the $0.9 million in sales discounts and an additional $1.0 million of inventory disposal costs incurred in the third quarter 2024. Gross profit from our Storage Solutions segment increased $0.1 million, or 2.7%, to $3.6 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $3.5 million for the third quarter 2023. \n\nGross profit margin decreased to 21.6% for the third quarter 2024, compared to 29.1% for the year ago period. The decrease in gross profit margin was largely driven by our Gardening and Cultivation segment, which had a gross profit margin of 17.3% for the third quarter 2024 as compared to 26.3% for the third quarter 2023, due to the effects of the strategic restructuring plan, including the inventory disposal costs and inventory sales discounts, reduced inventory discounts from vendors, and continued industry pricing compression on distributed products. Gross profit margin also decreased for our Storage Solutions segment to 42.2% in the third quarter 2024 from 46.4% in the same prior year period primarily driven by higher costs of inventory. \n\nAdjusted Gross Profit(2) and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin(2), which exclude the effects of the strategic restructuring plan announced in July 2024, were $12.7 million and 25.4% for the third quarter 2024, respectively, compared to $16.2 million and 29.1% for the third quarter 2023. \n\nStore and other operating expenses for the third quarter 2024 were $10.0 million compared to $11.7 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 13.9%, primarily driven by the 25 store consolidations since the end of the third quarter 2023. \n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses in the third quarter 2024 were $7.4 million compared to $7.6 million in the third quarter 2023, a decrease of 2.3%. \n\nGAAP net loss was $11.4 million for the third quarter 2024, or a loss of $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $7.3 million in the year ago period, or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) was a loss of $2.4 million in the third quarter 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA(1) loss of $0.9 million in the same prior year period. \n\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were $55.2 million. Inventory as of September 30, 2024 was $48.0 million, and prepaid and other current assets were $7.7 million. \n\nTotal current liabilities, including accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were $24.5 million. \n\n**Geographical Footprint**\n\nOur geographic footprint for our Cultivation and Gardening segment spans 724,000 square feet of retail and warehouse space and includes 31 retail locations across 12 states. To date in fiscal 2024, we have consolidated 19 retail stores where we generally expect to be able to serve the same customer base through a single location, thereby reducing redundancies in cost structure. \n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Outlook(3)**\n\nAs a result of its previously announced restructuring plan, GrowGen expects full-year 2024 net sales in the range of $190 million to $195 million. In the prior quarter, we had removed our full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance as we assessed the impact of the restructuring, and we expect to provide updated Adjusted EBITDA guidance at a later date. \n\n**Footnotes**\n\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization as adjusted for certain items as set forth in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information and is a measure calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information herein for further discussion and reconciliation of this measure to GAAP measures. \n\n(2) Adjusted Gross Profit represents gross profit as adjusted for certain items as set forth in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information, and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is calculated as Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of net sales. These measures are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information herein for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures to GAAP measures. \n\n(3) Sales and Adjusted EBITDA guidance metrics are inclusive of any acquisitions and store openings completed in 2024 and 2023, but do not include any unannounced acquisitions. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call today, November 12, 2024, at 4:30PM Eastern Time.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net income (loss), gross profit, and gross profit margin, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods, identify trends affecting our business, and project future performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and reporting purposes, and we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance, our ability to generate cash, and valuation. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions routinely received from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \n\n**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry and should not be construed in isolation as substitutions to net income (loss) as indicators of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). GrowGeneration defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude certain items such as stock-based compensation, impairment losses, restructuring and corporate rationalization costs, and other non-core or non-recurring expenses and to include income from our marketable securities as these investments are part of our operational business strategy and increase the cash available to us. \n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss (in thousands): \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet loss  |  $  |  (11,435  |  )  |  $  |  (7,349  |  )  |  $  |  (26,168  |  )  |  $  |  (19,182  |  )   \n(Benefit) provision for income taxes  |  (43  |  )  |  —  |  50  |  93   \nInterest income  |  (663  |  )  |  (705  |  )  |  (2,002  |  )  |  (1,886  |  )   \nInterest expense  |  —  |  1  |  70  |  6   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  4,972  |  4,721  |  12,329  |  12,477   \nEBITDA  |  $  |  (7,169  |  )  |  $  |  (3,332  |  )  |  $  |  (15,721  |  )  |  $  |  (8,492  |  )   \nShare-based compensation  |  672  |  938  |  2,104  |  2,452   \nInvestment income  |  623  |  705  |  1,921  |  1,886   \nImpairment loss (1) |  220  |  —  |  220  |  —   \nRestructuring plan (2) |  2,699  |  —  |  2,699  |  —   \nConsolidation and other charges (3) |  567  |  781  |  2,375  |  2,300   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  (2,388  |  )  |  $  |  (908  |  )  |  $  |  (6,402  |  )  |  $  |  (1,854  |  )   \n(1) Impairment loss related to the restructuring plan for operating lease right-of-use assets impairments   \n(2) Includes the $1.8 million incurred in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the restructuring plan as well as an estimated additional $0.9 million loss in gross profit due to inventory discounts offered in conjunction with the restructuring plan   \n(3) Consists primarily of expenditures related to the activity of store and distribution consolidation and one-time severances outside of the restructuring plan announced July 2024   \n  \n**_Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin_**\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry and should not be construed in isolation as substitutions to gross profit or gross profit margin, defined as our gross profit as a percentage of net sales, as indicators of operating performance (each as determined in accordance with GAAP).

In particular, we exceeded our near-term targets for proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales, which grew to 23.8%, compared to 19.4% for the third quarter last year. This is tracking well against our goal to grow proprietary brand sales to 35% in 2025. Additionally, same-store sales grew 12.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, reflecting the strong performance of our core store locations as we right-size our retail footprint. In addition, we met our store closures target, even as we maintained our focus on improving efficiencies, reducing store and other operating expenses by 13.9% during the quarter. Our financial position also remains strong, with $55.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and no debt.” \n\n“Our same-store sales growth, reduction in expenses and the improvement in our proprietary brand sales all demonstrate, our actions to date have proven successful in positioning GrowGen for sustainable growth in 2025. In line with these priorities, we are also on track to launch our e-commerce portal in the fourth quarter of this year, which is a key part of our digital transformation and B2B customer focus. We are well-positioned in the industry to capitalize on growth opportunities, and our restructuring plan has put us on a stronger footing to drive revenue growth, optimize margins, and build a leaner, more profitable company,” added Mr. Lampert. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results**\n\nNet sales declined $5.7 million, or 10.2%, to $50.0 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $55.7 million for the third quarter 2023. \n\nThe decrease in net sales was primarily related to our Cultivation and Gardening segment, which had net sales of $41.4 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $48.0 million for the same prior year period. Cultivation and Gardening’s decrease in net sales was primarily driven by the fiscal 2023 consolidation of 6 retail locations after the third quarter 2023 in addition to 19 retail locations to date in fiscal 2024, which include the 12 redundant or underperforming retail locations consolidated in conjunction with our strategic restructuring plan announced in July 2024. Additionally, we estimate that sales discounts offered as part of our strategic restructuring plan at those 12 retail locations negatively impacted net sales by approximately $0.9 million in the third quarter 2024. Cultivation and Gardening’s same-store sales increased 12.5%, primarily attributable to commercial sales growth, customer retention in markets where there were retail location closures, and improvements in our e-commerce site sales volume. Proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales for the third quarter 2024 increased to 23.8% as compared to 19.4% for the same prior year period largely driven by our strategic initiatives to increase sales volume with our expanded portfolio of proprietary brands and products and various proprietary product launches. The percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales related to consumable products remained relatively flat at 73.3% and 73.5% for the third quarter 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nAdditionally, net sales of commercial fixtures within our Storage Solutions segment increased by 12.9% to $8.6 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $7.6 million for the year ago period, primarily due to increased demand from retail customers and timing differences of various projects being pushed into the third quarter of 2024 from the prior quarter. \n\nGross profit was $10.8 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $16.2 million for the third quarter 2023, a decrease of $5.4 million or 33.2%. The decrease in gross profit was driven primarily by our Cultivation and Gardening segment, which decreased $5.5 million, or 43.3%, largely as a result of the 25 store consolidations since the end of the third quarter 2023 as well as the effects of our strategic restructuring plan, which include the $0.9 million in sales discounts and an additional $1.0 million of inventory disposal costs incurred in the third quarter 2024. Gross profit from our Storage Solutions segment increased $0.1 million, or 2.7%, to $3.6 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $3.5 million for the third quarter 2023. \n\nGross profit margin decreased to 21.6% for the third quarter 2024, compared to 29.1% for the year ago period. The decrease in gross profit margin was largely driven by our Gardening and Cultivation segment, which had a gross profit margin of 17.3% for the third quarter 2024 as compared to 26.3% for the third quarter 2023, due to the effects of the strategic restructuring plan, including the inventory disposal costs and inventory sales discounts, reduced inventory discounts from vendors, and continued industry pricing compression on distributed products. Gross profit margin also decreased for our Storage Solutions segment to 42.2% in the third quarter 2024 from 46.4% in the same prior year period primarily driven by higher costs of inventory. \n\nAdjusted Gross Profit(2) and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin(2), which exclude the effects of the strategic restructuring plan announced in July 2024, were $12.7 million and 25.4% for the third quarter 2024, respectively, compared to $16.2 million and 29.1% for the third quarter 2023. \n\nStore and other operating expenses for the third quarter 2024 were $10.0 million compared to $11.7 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 13.9%, primarily driven by the 25 store consolidations since the end of the third quarter 2023. \n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses in the third quarter 2024 were $7.4 million compared to $7.6 million in the third quarter 2023, a decrease of 2.3%. \n\nGAAP net loss was $11.4 million for the third quarter 2024, or a loss of $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $7.3 million in the year ago period, or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) was a loss of $2.4 million in the third quarter 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA(1) loss of $0.9 million in the same prior year period. \n\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were $55.2 million. Inventory as of September 30, 2024 was $48.0 million, and prepaid and other current assets were $7.7 million. \n\nTotal current liabilities, including accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were $24.5 million. \n\n**Geographical Footprint**\n\nOur geographic footprint for our Cultivation and Gardening segment spans 724,000 square feet of retail and warehouse space and includes 31 retail locations across 12 states. To date in fiscal 2024, we have consolidated 19 retail stores where we generally expect to be able to serve the same customer base through a single location, thereby reducing redundancies in cost structure. \n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Outlook(3)**\n\nAs a result of its previously announced restructuring plan, GrowGen expects full-year 2024 net sales in the range of $190 million to $195 million. In the prior quarter, we had removed our full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance as we assessed the impact of the restructuring, and we expect to provide updated Adjusted EBITDA guidance at a later date. \n\n**Footnotes**\n\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization as adjusted for certain items as set forth in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information and is a measure calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information herein for further discussion and reconciliation of this measure to GAAP measures. \n\n(2) Adjusted Gross Profit represents gross profit as adjusted for certain items as set forth in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information, and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is calculated as Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of net sales. These measures are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information herein for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures to GAAP measures. \n\n(3) Sales and Adjusted EBITDA guidance metrics are inclusive of any acquisitions and store openings completed in 2024 and 2023, but do not include any unannounced acquisitions. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call today, November 12, 2024, at 4:30PM Eastern Time.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net income (loss), gross profit, and gross profit margin, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods, identify trends affecting our business, and project future performance. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and reporting purposes, and we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance, our ability to generate cash, and valuation. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions routinely received from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \n\n**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry and should not be construed in isolation as substitutions to net income (loss) as indicators of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). GrowGeneration defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude certain items such as stock-based compensation, impairment losses, restructuring and corporate rationalization costs, and other non-core or non-recurring expenses and to include income from our marketable securities as these investments are part of our operational business strategy and increase the cash available to us. \n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss (in thousands): \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet loss  |  $  |  (11,435  |  )  |  $  |  (7,349  |  )  |  $  |  (26,168  |  )  |  $  |  (19,182  |  )   \n(Benefit) provision for income taxes  |  (43  |  )  |  —  |  50  |  93   \nInterest income  |  (663  |  )  |  (705  |  )  |  (2,002  |  )  |  (1,886  |  )   \nInterest expense  |  —  |  1  |  70  |  6   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  4,972  |  4,721  |  12,329  |  12,477   \nEBITDA  |  $  |  (7,169  |  )  |  $  |  (3,332  |  )  |  $  |  (15,721  |  )  |  $  |  (8,492  |  )   \nShare-based compensation  |  672  |  938  |  2,104  |  2,452   \nInvestment income  |  623  |  705  |  1,921  |  1,886   \nImpairment loss (1) |  220  |  —  |  220  |  —   \nRestructuring plan (2) |  2,699  |  —  |  2,699  |  —   \nConsolidation and other charges (3) |  567  |  781  |  2,375  |  2,300   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  (2,388  |  )  |  $  |  (908  |  )  |  $  |  (6,402  |  )  |  $  |  (1,854  |  )   \n(1) Impairment loss related to the restructuring plan for operating lease right-of-use assets impairments   \n(2) Includes the $1.8 million incurred in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the restructuring plan as well as an estimated additional $0.9 million loss in gross profit due to inventory discounts offered in conjunction with the restructuring plan   \n(3) Consists primarily of expenditures related to the activity of store and distribution consolidation and one-time severances outside of the restructuring plan announced July 2024   \n  \n**_Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin_**\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry and should not be construed in isolation as substitutions to gross profit or gross profit margin, defined as our gross profit as a percentage of net sales, as indicators of operating performance (each as determined in accordance with GAAP).

(NASDAQ: GRWG)\n(“GrowGeneration,” “GrowGen,” or the “Company”), one of the largest retailers and\ndistributors of specialty hydroponic and organic gardening products in the United States,\ntoday announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Summary\nNet sales decreased 10.2% year over year to $50.0 million for the third quarter 2024,\ndue to 25 less retail locations;\nPositive same-store sales of 12.5% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior\nyear;\nProprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales\nincreased to 23.8% as compared to 19.4% in the third quarter of 2023;\nGross profit margin of 21.6%, a 750 basis point decrease from the 29.1% in the year\nago period mainly due to restructuring related activities;\nOperating expenses decreased $1.3 million, or 5.4%, to $22.9 million in the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to the same prior year period;\nNet loss of $11.4 million the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of $7.3\nmillion in the year ago period;\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) loss of $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of\n$1.5 million from the year ago period; and\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $55.2 million and no debt.\nDarren Lampert, GrowGen’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our\nthird quarter results were consistent with our expectations and reflect the substantial\nprogress we have made executing on our strategic restructuring plan. In particular, we\nexceeded our near-term targets for proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation\nand Gardening net sales, which grew to 23.8%, compared to 19.4% for the third quarter last\nyear. This is tracking well against our goal to grow proprietary brand sales to 35% in 2025.\nAdditionally, same-store sales grew 12.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, reflecting the\nstrong performance of our core store locations as we right-size our retail footprint. In\naddition, we met our store closures target, even as we maintained our focus on improving\nefficiencies, reducing store and other operating expenses by 13.9% during the quarter. Our\nfinancial position also remains strong, with $55.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and\nmarketable securities and no debt.”\n“Our same-store sales growth, reduction in expenses and the improvement in our\nproprietary brand sales all demonstrate, our actions to date have proven successful in\npositioning GrowGen for sustainable growth in 2025. In line with these priorities, we are also\non track to launch our e-commerce portal in the fourth quarter of this year, which is a key\npart of our digital transformation and B2B customer focus. We are well-positioned in the\nindustry to capitalize on growth opportunities, and our restructuring plan has put us on a\nstronger footing to drive revenue growth, optimize margins, and build a leaner, more\nprofitable company,” added Mr. Lampert.\nThird Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results\nNet sales declined $5.7 million, or 10.2%, to $50.0 million for the third quarter 2024\ncompared to $55.7 million for the third quarter 2023.\nThe decrease in net sales was primarily related to our Cultivation and Gardening segment,\nwhich had net sales of $41.4 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $48.0 million for\nthe same prior year period. Cultivation and Gardening’s decrease in net sales was primarily\ndriven by the fiscal 2023 consolidation of 6 retail locations after the third quarter 2023 in\naddition to 19 retail locations to date in fiscal 2024, which include the 12 redundant or\nunderperforming retail locations consolidated in conjunction with our strategic restructuring\nplan announced in July 2024. Additionally, we estimate that sales discounts offered as part\nof our strategic restructuring plan at those 12 retail locations negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $0.9 million in the third quarter 2024. Cultivation and Gardening’s same-\nstore sales increased 12.5%, primarily attributable to commercial sales growth, customer\nretention in markets where there were retail location closures, and improvements in our e-\ncommerce site sales volume. Proprietary brand sales as a percentage of Cultivation and\nGardening net sales for the third quarter 2024 increased to 23.8% as compared to 19.4% for\nthe same prior year period largely driven by our strategic initiatives to increase sales volume\nwith our expanded portfolio of proprietary brands and products and various proprietary\nproduct launches. The percentage of Cultivation and Gardening net sales related to\nconsumable products remained relatively flat at 73.3% and 73.5% for the third quarter 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\nAdditionally, net sales of commercial fixtures within our Storage Solutions segment\nincreased by 12.9% to $8.6 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $7.6 million for the\nyear ago period, primarily due to increased demand from retail customers and timing\ndifferences of various projects being pushed into the third quarter of 2024 from the prior\nquarter.\nGross profit was $10.8 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $16.2 million for the\nthird quarter 2023, a decrease of $5.4 million or 33.2%. The decrease in gross profit was\ndriven primarily by our Cultivation and Gardening segment, which decreased $5.5 million, or\n43.3%, largely as a result of the 25 store consolidations since the end of the third quarter\n2023 as well as the effects of our strategic restructuring plan, which include the $0.9 million\nin sales discounts and an additional $1.0 million of inventory disposal costs incurred in the\nthird quarter 2024. Gross profit from our Storage Solutions segment increased $0.1 million,\nor 2.7%, to $3.6 million for the third quarter 2024 compared to $3.5 million for the third\nquarter 2023.\nGross profit margin decreased to 21.6% for the third quarter 2024, compared to 29.1% for\nthe year ago period. The decrease in gross profit margin was largely driven by our\nGardening and Cultivation segment, which had a gross profit margin of 17.3% for the third\nquarter 2024 as compared to 26.3% for the third quarter 2023, due to the effects of the\nstrategic restructuring plan, including the inventory disposal costs and inventory sales\ndiscounts, reduced inventory discounts from vendors, and continued industry pricing\ncompression on distributed products. Gross profit margin also decreased for our Storage\nSolutions segment to 42.2% in the third quarter 2024 from 46.4% in the same prior year\nperiod primarily driven by higher costs of inventory.\nAdjusted Gross Profit(2) and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin(2), which exclude the effects of the\nstrategic restructuring plan announced in July 2024, were $12.7 million and 25.4% for the\nthird quarter 2024, respectively, compared to $16.2 million and 29.1% for the third quarter\n2023.\nStore and other operating expenses for the third quarter 2024 were $10.0 million compared\nto $11.7 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 13.9%, primarily driven by the 25 store\nconsolidations since the end of the third quarter 2023.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses in the third quarter 2024 were $7.4 million\ncompared to $7.6 million in the third quarter 2023, a decrease of 2.3%.\nGAAP net loss was $11.4 million for the third quarter 2024, or a loss of $0.19 per diluted\nshare, compared to $7.3 million in the year ago period, or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) was a loss of $2.4 million in the third quarter 2024, compared to\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) loss of $0.9 million in the same prior year period.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were $55.2\nmillion. Inventory as of September 30, 2024 was $48.0 million, and prepaid and other current\nassets were $7.7 million.\nTotal current liabilities, including accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other liabilities as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 were $24.5 million.\nGeographical Footprint\nOur geographic footprint for our Cultivation and Gardening segment spans 724,000 square\nfeet of retail and warehouse space and includes 31 retail locations across 12 states. To date\nin fiscal 2024, we have consolidated 19 retail stores where we generally expect to be able to\nserve the same customer base through a single location, thereby reducing redundancies in\ncost structure.\nFiscal Year 2024 Financial Outlook(3)\nAs a result of its previously announced restructuring plan, GrowGen expects full-year 2024\nnet sales in the range of $190 million to $195 million. In the prior quarter, we had removed\nour full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance as we assessed the impact of the\nrestructuring, and we expect to provide updated Adjusted EBITDA guidance at a later date.\nFootnotes\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and\namortization as adjusted for certain items as set forth in the reconciliation table of U.S.\nGAAP to non-GAAP information and is a measure calculated and presented on the basis of\nmethodologies other than in accordance with GAAP.

We\nbelieve these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with their most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measures, net income (loss), gross profit, and gross\nprofit margin, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and\ninvestors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods, identify trends\naffecting our business, and project future performance. Management uses these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures for internal planning and reporting purposes, and we believe that these\nnon-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in their assessment of our\noperating performance, our ability to generate cash, and valuation. In addition, these non-\nGAAP financial measures address questions routinely received from analysts and investors\nand, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, we have determined\nthat it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our\nindustry and should not be construed in isolation as substitutions to net income (loss) as\nindicators of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow provided by operating\nactivities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP).\nGrowGeneration defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, interest\nexpense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as\nfurther adjusted to exclude certain items such as stock-based compensation, impairment\nlosses, restructuring and corporate rationalization costs, and other non-core or non-recurring\nexpenses and to include income from our marketable securities as these investments are\npart of our operational business strategy and increase the cash available to us.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss (in\nthousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (11,435) $ (7,349) $ (26,168) $ (19,182)\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes (43) — 50 93\nInterest income (663) (705) (2,002) (1,886)\nInterest expense — 1 70 6\nDepreciation and amortization 4,972 4,721 12,329 12,477\nEBITDA $ (7,169) $ (3,332) $ (15,721) $ (8,492)\nShare-based compensation 672 938 2,104 2,452\nInvestment income 623 705 1,921 1,886\nImpairment loss (1) 220 — 220 —\nRestructuring plan (2) 2,699 — 2,699 —\nConsolidation and other charges (3) 567 781 2,375 2,300\n$ (2,388) $ (908) $ (6,402) $ (1,854)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(1) Impairment loss related to the restructuring plan for operating lease right-of-use assets impairments\n(2) Includes the $1.8 million incurred in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the restructuring plan as well\nas an estimated additional $0.9 million loss in gross profit due to inventory discounts offered in conjunction with the restructuring plan\n(3) Consists primarily of expenditures related to the activity of store and distribution consolidation and one-time severances outside of\nthe restructuring plan announced July 2024\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are non-GAAP financial measures\ncommonly used in our industry and should not be construed in isolation as substitutions to\ngross profit or gross profit margin, defined as our gross profit as a percentage of net sales,\nas indicators of operating performance (each as determined in accordance with GAAP).\nGrowGeneration calculates Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit adjusted to exclude the\neffects related to the strategic restructuring plan, and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is\ncalculated as Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of net sales.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin\nto gross profit and gross profit margin (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales $ 50,006 $ 55,678 $ 151,430 $ 176,430\nCost of sales 39,196 39,490 113,835 126,816\nGross profit $ 10,810 $ 16,188 $ 37,595 $ 49,614\n21.6% 29.1% 24.8% 28.1%\nGross profit margin\nRestructuring plan (1) $ 1,903 $ — $ 1,903 $ —\nAdjusted Gross Profit $ 12,713 $ 16,188 $ 39,498 $ 49,614\n25.4% 29.1% 26.1% 28.1%\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n(1) Includes the $1.0 million incurred in Cost of sales within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the\nrestructuring plan as well as an estimated additional $0.9 million loss in gross profit due to inventory discounts offered in conjunction\nwith the restructuring plan\nView source version on businesswire.com:\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241112764559/en/\nKCSA Strategic Communications\nPhilip Carlson\nManaging Director\nT: 212-896-1233\nE: GrowGen@kcsa.com\nSource: GrowGeneration Corp."
