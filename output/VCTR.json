(NASDAQ: VCTR) (“Victory Capital” or “the Company”) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“During the third quarter, we made excellent progress toward closing the Amundi transaction,” said David Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We reached a formal agreement early in the quarter and, in October, our shareholders approved all proxy proposals on the ballot at our Special Meeting of Stockholders. \n\n“Integration work is proceeding, and we are working with Amundi’s non-U.S. distribution teams to facilitate sales of our products throughout their global networks and joint ventures upon closing, which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2025. Based on work completed to date, we are maintaining our guidance of $100 million in annualized expense synergies. These expense synergies are expected to be fully realized within two years of closing with the majority achieved within the first year. \n\n“Our business performance was strong through the first nine months of 2024. In the third quarter, we achieved the highest quarterly adjusted earnings per diluted share with tax benefit, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin in the history of our firm. Through the end of September, the percentage of our AUM outperforming benchmarks over the respective 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods was 60%, 73%, and 77%. In addition, 67% of our AUM in mutual funds and ETFs was rated four or five stars overall by Morningstar. \n\n“Cash on the balance sheet was $188 million, up $69 million from the end of the second quarter. Our net leverage ratio declined to 1.7x due to growth in Adjusted EBITDA and our increased cash position. Additionally, the Board authorized another 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.41 to $0.44 per share, which will be paid in December. \n\n“As always, we continue to focus on serving our clients, which is our top priority.” \n\n1  Total AUM includes both discretionary and non-discretionary client assets.   \n---  \n2  The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not defined by GAAP and should not be regarded as an alternative to any measurement under GAAP. Please refer to the section “Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release for an explanation of Non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP financial measure.   \n  \nThe table below presents AUM, and certain GAAP and non-GAAP (“adjusted”) financial results.

These measures eliminate the impact of one-time acquisition, restructuring and integration costs and demonstrate the ongoing operating earnings metrics of the Company. The Company has included these non-GAAP measures to provide investors with the same financial metrics used by management to assess the operating performance of the Company. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjustments made to GAAP Net Income to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, are: \n\n  * Adding back income tax expense; \n  * Adding back interest paid on debt and other financing costs, net of interest income; \n  * Adding back depreciation on property and equipment; \n  * Adding back other business taxes; \n  * Adding back amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets; \n  * Adding back stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards issued from pools created in connection with the management-led buyout and various acquisitions and as a result of equity grants related to the IPO; \n  * Adding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions, including restructuring costs; \n  * Adding back debt issuance cost expense; \n  * Adjusting for earnings/losses on equity method investments. \n\n\n\nAdjusted Net Income\n\nAdjustments made to GAAP Net Income to calculate Adjusted Net Income, as applicable, are: \n\n  * Adding back other business taxes; \n  * Adding back amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets; \n  * Adding back stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards issued from pools created in connection with the management-led buyout and various acquisitions and as a result of any equity grants related to the IPO; \n  * Adding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions, including restructuring costs; \n  * Adding back debt issuance cost expense; \n  * Subtracting an estimate of income tax expense applied to the sum of the adjustments above. \n\n\n\nTax Benefit of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nDue to Victory Capital’s acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide it with additional significant supplemental economic benefit. The tax benefit of goodwill and intangible assets represent the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangible assets and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which the Company received a step-up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period. The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangible assets with a step-up in tax basis. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241107097306r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investors:** Matthew Dennis, CFA Chief of Staff Director, Investor Relations 216-898-2412 mdennis@vcm.com\n\n**Media:** Jessica Davila Director, Global Communications 210-694-9693 jessica_davila@vcm.com\n\nSource: Victory Capital Holdings, Inc.\n\n**Multimedia Files:**\n\n[ ![](//s26.q4cdn.com/410981916/files/doc_multimedia/2024/11/1009047189/VC_Logo_2C_640x360@thumbnail.png) ](//s26.q4cdn.com/410981916/files/doc_multimedia/2024/11/1009047189/VC_Logo_2C_640x360.jpg)\n\n640 x 360 jpg 30 KB\n\nDownload: \n\n[ Download original jpg 30 KB 640 x 360 ](//s26.q4cdn.com/410981916/files/doc_multimedia/2024/11/1009047189/VC_Logo_2C_640x360.jpg)\n\n[ Download thumbnail png 11 KB 200 x 113 ](//s26.q4cdn.com/410981916/files/doc_multimedia/2024/11/1009047189/VC_Logo_2C_640x360@thumbnail.png)\n\n[ Download lowres png 54 KB 480 x 270 ](//s26.q4cdn.com/410981916/files/doc_multimedia/2024/11/1009047189/VC_Logo_2C_640x360@lowres.png)\n\n[ Download square png 25 KB 250 x 250 ](//s26.q4cdn.com/410981916/files/doc_multimedia/2024/11/1009047189/VC_Logo_2C_640x360@square.png)\n\n[ View all news ](/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Contact us\n\n**Investors in VCTR**\n\nMatthew Dennis, CFA Chief of Staff, Director, Investor Relations \n\n[216-898-2412](tel:216-898-2412) ir@vcm.com\n\n**Media**\n\nJessica Davila Director, Global Communications \n\n[210-694-9693](tel:310-622-8226) jessica_davila@vcm.com\n\n**Additional Contacts**\n\nVictory Fund Investors\n\n(formerly USAA® Mutual Funds)\n\n[1-800-235-8396](tel:1-800-235-8396)\n\nVictory Fund Investors\n\n[1-800-539-3863](tel:1-800-539-3863)\n\nInvestment Professionals\n\n[1-800-991-8191](tel:1-800-991-8191)\n\n## Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

These measures eliminate the impact of one-time acquisition, restructuring and integration\ncosts and demonstrate the ongoing operating earnings metrics of the Company. The Company has included these non-GAAP\nmeasures to provide investors with the same financial metrics used by management to assess the operating performance of the\nCompany. Due to rounding, numbers presented in the following tables may not add up to precisely the totals provided.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjustments made to GAAP Net Income to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, are:\n• Adding back income tax expense;\n• Adding back interest paid on debt and other financing costs net of interest income;\n• Adding back depreciation on property and equipment;\n• Adding back other business taxes;\n• Adding back amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets;\n• Adding back stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards issued from pools created in connection with\nthe management-led buyout and various acquisitions and as a result of equity grants related to the IPO;\n• Adding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions, including restructuring costs;\n• Adding back debt issuance costs; and\n• Adjusting for earnings/losses on equity method investments.\n23\nNotes and Disclosures\nInformation Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures (cont.)\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjustments made to GAAP Net Income to calculate Adjusted Net Income, as applicable, are:\n• Adding back other business taxes;\n• Adding back amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets;\n• Adding back stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards issued from pools created in connection with\nthe management-led buyout and various acquisitions and as a result of any equity grants related to the IPO;\n• Adding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions, including restructuring costs;\n• Adding back debt issuance costs; and\n• Subtracting an estimate of income tax expense applied to the sum of the adjustments above.\nTax Benefit of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nDue to Victory Capital’s acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide it with\nadditional significant supplemental economic benefit.

Read it carefully before investing.\nA fund’s most recent performance can be found at vcm.com. 57 mutual funds and ETFs did not have 4- or 5- star overall ratings\nor are not rated. 32% of AUM in mutual funds and ETFs did not receive overall rating of 4 or 5 stars or are not rated. Internal\nanalysis by Victory Capital was used to calculate relative performance. Not all asset classes considered are available to the\ngeneral public and not all funds included have a history to be included in each time period. The returns used for this comparison\nare at net asset value (NAV), do not reflect the affect of sales charge, if applicable, and do not reflect the returns an investor\nwould receive. Visit www.vcm.com for more information.\nThe Morningstar Rating for funds, or “star rating,” is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity\nand variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year\nhistory. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is\ncalculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly\nexcess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of\nproducts in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5%\nreceive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a\nweighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating\nmetrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for\n60–119 months of total returns, and 50% ten-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of\ntotal returns. While the ten-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the ten-year period, the most recent\nthree-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Ratings may reflect fee\nwaivers in effect; in their absence, ratings may have been lower.\n34"

These measures eliminate the\nimpact of one-time acquisition, restructuring and integration costs and demonstrate the ongoing\noperating earnings metrics of the Company. The Company has included these non-GAAP\nmeasures to provide investors with the same financial metrics used by management to assess\nthe operating performance of the Company.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjustments made to GAAP Net Income to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, are:\n• Adding back income tax expense;\n• Adding back interest paid on debt and other financing costs, net of interest income;\n• Adding back depreciation on property and equipment;\n• Adding back other business taxes;\n• Adding back amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets;\n• Adding back stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards\nissued from pools created in connection with the management-led buyout and various\nacquisitions and as a result of equity grants related to the IPO;\n• Adding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions, including restructuring costs;\n• Adding back debt issuance cost expense;\n• Adjusting for earnings/losses on equity method investments.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjustments made to GAAP Net Income to calculate Adjusted Net Income, as applicable, are:\n• Adding back other business taxes;\n• Adding back amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets;\n• Adding back stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards\nissued from pools created in connection with the management-led buyout and various\nacquisitions and as a result of any equity grants related to the IPO;\n• Adding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions, including restructuring costs;\n• Adding back debt issuance cost expense;\n• Subtracting an estimate of income tax expense applied to the sum of the adjustments\nabove.\nTax Benefit of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nDue to Victory Capital’s acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets\nand goodwill provide it with additional significant supplemental economic benefit. The tax benefit\nof goodwill and intangible assets represent the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed\nfor intangible assets and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which the Company\nreceived a step-up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be\namortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period. The tax benefit from amortization on\nthese assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangible\nassets with a step-up in tax basis.\n17"
