Michael Burns is promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer effective January 2, 2025.\n\nNathan Goldman retires from CSX after a distinguished 21-year tenure with the company. Goldman's leadership was pivotal in steering the transformation of the business and the transition of three CEOs in eight years, serving all three leaders and the Board of Directors with confidence.\n\n“Nathan’s contributions to CSX have been highly valued, and his expertise and dedication have been instrumental to our organization. His leadership will leave a lasting legacy, having developed the best group of legal, regulatory and compliance professionals in the industry. We are grateful to Nathan for his outstanding service and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement,” said CSX president and CEO Joe Hinrichs. “With 18 years of dedicated service and extensive experience with the company, Michael’s promotion to chief legal officer will bring invaluable insight and stability as we advance our strategy to deliver profitable growth.”\n\nIn his new role, Michael Burns will oversee all of CSX's legal and regulatory affairs, the corporate secretary’s office, risk management, police and infrastructure protection, environmental and hazmat, and audit functions. He previously served as CSX vice president and general counsel. Since joining CSX in 2006, Burns has advanced through roles of increasing responsibility, initially focusing on employment and benefits law before assuming responsibility for the full law department and additional functions such as corporate secretary, risk management, and environmental and hazmat responsibilities. Prior to CSX, Burns practiced labor and employment law at a leading Indiana firm. He holds a bachelor's degree from Wabash College and a Juris Doctor from Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.\n\n“This leadership transition underscores CSX’s commitment to growth and highlights our confidence in the exceptional depth of talent within our organization. We are fortunate to have an outstanding team of railroaders poised to harness our current momentum and propel us toward even greater success,” said Hinrichs. “I am grateful for the dedication of our team and excited about the opportunities ahead.”\n\n**About CSX**\n\nCSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no\nobligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the company updates any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn\nthat the company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual performance or results could differ materially from that\nanticipated by any forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-\nlooking statements include, among others; (i) the company’s success in implementing its financial and operational initiatives; (ii) changes in domestic\nor international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry\ncompetition, conditions, performance and consolidation); (iii) legislative or regulatory changes; (iv) the inherent business risks associated with safety\nand security; (v) the outcome of claims and litigation involving or affecting the company; (vi) natural events such as severe weather conditions or\npandemic health crises; and (vii) the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions.\nOther important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are\nspecified in the company’s SEC reports, accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and the company’s website at www.csx.com.\n2024 THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\nNon-GAAP Measures Disclosure\nCSX reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). CSX also\nuses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e),\nwhich may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results.\nNon-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to\nbe comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in\nisolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP\nmeasures to corresponding GAAP measures are attached hereto in the Appendix of this presentation.\n2024 THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nJoe Hinrichs\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nThird Quarter Financial and Operational Highlights\n+3% +6% 37.4% +180 bps\nTotal Volume Merchandise Revenue Operating Margin Y/Y Op Margin\nRevenue Operating Income Earnings Per Share\n$3,619M\n$3,572M\n$1,354M $0.46\n$1,271M\n$0.41\n+1% Y/Y increase +7% Y/Y increase +12% Y/Y increase\nQ3 23 Q3 24 Q3 23 Q3 24 Q3 23 Q3 24\nNote: Immaterial revisions have been made to prior period amounts.
