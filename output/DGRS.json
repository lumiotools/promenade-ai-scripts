Index returns are gross total returns. You cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance is not indicative of future returns.\nWe believe the conditions that set up the massive outperformance by mega-cap growth stocks in the last decade\nare unlikely to be repeated. Chief among these conditions were historically low interest rates, persistently low\ninflation, low—yet stable—economic growth and relatively inexpensive starting multiples for growth stocks.\nIf we continue to see a reversal, where interest rates are rising, inflation remains hot and economic growth is more\nvolatile, we should reasonably expect the laggard of the last decade—small-cap value—to be the leader for the\nnext decade.\nTo see such a cyclical reversal in size leadership is the historical norm. As we can see below, large and small caps\ntended to cycle in and out of outperformance, generally on a 10-year time frame. The most recent outperformance\nof large caps over small caps has been since 2014.\nOver the long run, since 1926, small caps have outperformed large caps by 386% cumulatively, or 170 bps annualized.5\nSmall Caps vs. Large Caps: Cumulative Relative Total Returns\n10\nSmall Outperforming Large\n8\nLarge Outperforming Small\n6\n4.86\n4\n2\n0\nJune ’26 June ’41 June ’56 June ’71 June ’86 June ’01 June ’16 April ’22\nSources: WisdomTree, Fama French Data Library, 6/30/1926–4/30/2022.

Over the long run, history shows\nsmaller companies, particularly small value, have outperformed.\nWithin value, dividend payers have been handily outperforming non-payers. And there is a compelling case\nthat the factors contributing to the outperformance of dividend stocks this year seem likely to persist:\nHIGHER RATES\nAs the Fed aggressively hikes short-term rates, it stands to reason that investors will prefer the current\ncash flows of dividends over the uncertainty of non-dividend-paying growth stocks.\nINFLATION PROTECTION\nDividend growth has historically outpaced inflation. Because stocks are real assets with profits that\nincrease with inflation, dividend payouts also grow with inflation—unlike bond coupons.\nECONOMIC SLOWDOWN\nThe U.S. economy registered negative growth in the first quarter, raising the prospects that the economy\nmay be in—or entering—a soft patch. During economic slowdowns, investors tend to prefer the relative\nsafety of dividend payments.\nFor more information on dividends and the performance of dividend-paying\nequities, check out our Monthly Dividend Monitor.\n13\nWisdomTree RESEARCH Forgotten Mid-and Small-Cap Dividend Payers\nGlossary\nBasis point (bp): 1/100th of 1%. Buyback yield: The amount of a company’s buybacks divided by its market capitalization. Dividend yield:\nA financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its share price. Growth stocks: Stocks whose\nshare prices are higher relative to their earnings per share or dividends per share. Investors are willing to pay more because of their earnings\nor dividend growth expectations going forward. Value stocks: Stocks whose share prices are lower relative to their earnings per share or\ndividends per share. Investors pay less for these stocks because their earnings or dividend growth expectations going forward are lower.\nMarket cap: Market cap = share prices x number of shares outstanding. Firms with the highest values receive the highest weights in approaches\ndesigned to weight firms by market cap. Multiple: A ratio that is calculated by dividing the market or estimated value of an asset by a specific\nitem on the financial statements. The multiples approach is a comparables analysis method that seeks to value similar companies using the\nsame financial metrics. Price-to-book ratio: Share price divided by book value per share. Lower numbers indicate an ability to access greater\namounts of earnings per dollar invested. Price-to-cash flow ratio: Share price divided by cash flow per share. Lower numbers indicate an\nability to access greater amounts of cash flows per dollar invested. Price-to-earnings ratio: Share price divided by earnings per share. Lower\nnumbers indicate an ability to access greater amounts of earnings per dollar invested. Return on assets: Firm profits (after accounting for all\nexpenses) divided by the firm’s total assets. Higher numbers indicate greater profits relative to the level of assets utilized to generate them.\nReturn on equity: Measures a corporation’s profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders\nhave invested. Size capitalization: A measure by which a company’s size is classified. Mega cap generally refers to companies with a market\ncapitalization above $200 billion. Large caps are usually classified as companies that have a market cap of more than $10 billion. Mid-caps\nrange from $2 billion to $10 billion. Small caps are typically new or relatively young companies with a market cap between $200 million and\n$2 billion. Spread: Typically refers to a difference between a measure of yield for one asset class and a measure of yield for either a different\nsubset of that asset class or a different asset class entirely. Valuation risk: The risk of buying or over-weighting a particular stock that has\nappreciated significantly in price relative to its dividends, earnings or any other fundamental metric.\nIndex Definitions\nS&P 1500 Index: The S&P 1500, or S&P Composite 1500 Index, is a stock market index of US stocks made by Standard & Poor’s.

For a prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus containing this and other important information about the fund, call 866.909.9473 or visit WisdomTree.com/investments. Read the prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus carefully before investing.There are risks associated with investing, including the possible loss of principal.\n\nThis material contains the opinions of the authors, which are subject to change. There is no guarantee that any strategies discussed will work under all market conditions. This material represents an assessment of the market environment at a specific time and is not intended to be a forecast of future events or a guarantee of future results. \n\nImportant Risk Information\n\nThere are risks associated with investing, including the possible loss of principal. \n\nQGRW: Growth stocks, as a group, may be out of favor with the market and underperform value stocks or the overall equity market. Growth stocks are generally more sensitive to market movements than other types of stocks. The Fund is non-diversified, as a result, changes in the market value of a single security could cause greater fluctuations in the value of Fund shares than would occur in a diversified fund. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit. The Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets and the Index may not perform as intended.\n\nIHDG: Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. To the extent the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of companies of a single country or region, it is likely to be impacted by the events or conditions affecting that country or region. Dividends are not guaranteed and a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time. Investments in currency involve additional special risks, such as credit risk and interest rate fluctuations. Derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. As this Fund can have a high concentration in some issuers, the Fund can be adversely impacted by changes affecting those issuers. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nDGRW, DGRS: Funds focusing their investments on certain sectors increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. Dividends are not guaranteed and a company’s future abilities to pay dividends may be limited. A company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time.\n\nDXJ: Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. The Fund focuses its investments in Japan, thereby increasing the impact of events and developments in Japan that can adversely affect performance. Investments in currency involve additional special risks, such as credit risk, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investments which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. As this Fund can have a high concentration in some issuers, the Fund can be adversely impacted by changes affecting those issuers. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time.\n\nEPI: Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. This Fund focuses its investments in India, thereby increasing the impact of events and developments associated with the region which can adversely affect performance. Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets such as India are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. As this Fund has a high concentration in some sectors, the Fund can be adversely affected by changes in those sectors. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nUSFR: Securities with floating rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with fixed interest rates, but may decline in value. Fixed income securities will normally decline in value as interest rates rise. The value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning in response to issuer or counterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the Fund's portfolio investments. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nAGGY: Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Investing in mortgage- and asset-backed securities involves interest rate, credit, valuation, extension and liquidity risks and the risk that payments on the underlying assets are delayed, prepaid, subordinated or defaulted on. Due to the investment strategy of the Fund, it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nWTBN: Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. While the Fund attempts to limit credit and counterparty exposure, the value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning in response to issuer or counterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the Fund’s portfolio investments. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.\n\nMTGP: Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. In addition, when interest rates fall income may decline. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of an investment will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that investment to decline. Investing in mortgage- and asset-backed securities involves interest rate, credit, valuation, extension and liquidity risks and the risk that payments on the underlying assets are delayed, prepaid, subordinated or defaulted on. Liquidity risk may result from the lack of an active market, reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed income securities, and may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment and/or with respect to particular types of securities, such as securitized credit securities. Non-agency and other securitized debt are subject to heightened risks as compared to agency-backed securities. High yield or “junk” bonds have lower credit ratings and involve a greater risk to principal. Derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Unlike typical exchange-traded funds, the Fund is actively managed using proprietary investment strategies and processes and there can be no guarantee that these strategies and processes will be successful or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Due to the investment strategy of the Fund, it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\n\nHYIN: The Fund invests in alternative credit sectors through investments in underlying closed-end investment companies (“CEFs”), including those that have elected to be regulated as business development companies (“BDCs”), and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). The value of a CEF can decrease due to movements in the overall financial markets. BDCs generally invest in less mature private companies, which involve greater risk than well-established, publicly traded companies and are subject to high failure rates among the companies in which they invest. By investing in REITs, the Fund is exposed to the risks of owning real estate, such as decreases in real estate values, overbuilding, increased competition and other risks related to local or general economic conditions. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.\n\nPlease read each Funds’ prospectus for specific details regarding the Funds’ risk profiles.\n\nWisdomTree Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.\n\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. “WisdomTree” is a registered mark of WisdomTree, Inc. \n"
