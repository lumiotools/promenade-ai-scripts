This specialized course, ReDefine, crafted by ATF, offers customized training with a group of individuals who are experiencing similar struggles. The athletes receive physical training and the tools to redefine their sense of self through mindfulness and mental training. \n\n\"I first learned about ATF through the incredible story of Makala Noble, a former high school athlete who was paralyzed in a tumbling accident, who displayed an unwavering dedication to recovery,\" said Dr. Alvarez. \"Makala’s determination, combined with the powerful work ATF is doing on such a broad scale, instantly inspired me. Many of my patients have benefited from enhanced core strength with truFlex, so offering it to those who need specialized treatment options to help improve their quality of life felt like a natural fit.\" \n\nA survey study was also performed to evaluate the improvement in quality of life and the physical benefits of incorporating truFlex into the ReDefine training program.3 Many participants praised their treatment experience and noted improvements in areas they have struggled to progress, such as their abdomen, glutes, and thighs. \n\n“Cutera’s truFlex technology has unlocked innovative new pathways for our ATF athletes to increase muscle function and create newfound body-empowerment,” said David Vobora, ATF Founder. “We are excited to see the potential this device has on a population that is underserved and can be greatly impacted by its technology.” \n\ntruFlex is the first muscle stimulation device to deliver energy to specific muscle groups in a convenient, 15-minute treatment. It covers the largest body surface area of any device in the industry and can replicate up to 54,000 contractions to increase muscle mass up to 30% in areas including the abdomen, obliques, thighs, and glutes after one treatment series.1,2\n\nCutera plans to donate the truFlex device at the end of the year to continue treatments for future cohorts of adaptive athletes and aid in the positive work of the Adaptive Training Foundation. \n\n“We are honored to partner with such a worthwhile organization to share the positive effects of our unique muscle stimulation technology,” said Taylor Harris, CEO of Cutera. “This is just the start of our efforts to explore the additional benefits of truFlex while continuing to grow the body of evidence that supports the use of truFlex across multiple therapeutic indications.” \n\nInterested providers and patients can visit [yourtrubody.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fyourtrubody.com%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpressrelease%26utm_medium%3DPR%26utm_campaign%3Dpressrelease_PR_leadgen_truflex_1124&esheet=54150963&newsitemid=20241112062983&lan=en-US&anchor=yourtrubody.com&index=4&md5=c5ce4524c6c67648a856139735a9dacf) to learn more about truFlex, and hear stories from patients about their experiences.

(Nasdaq: CUTR), a leading provider of aesthetic and dermatology solutions, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n  * Consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 of $32.5 million\n  * Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $59.0 million\n  * AviClear growth of 16% vs prior year period driven by international capital system sales \n  * Global core capital growth of 7% on a sequential quarterly basis \n  * Full-year guidance maintained for both revenue and year-end cash balance \n\n\n\n“Our third quarter reflects consistent execution against our strategic priorities, with core capital sales improving on a sequential basis, AviClear continuing to grow year-over-year driven by strong sales and utilization in international markets, and favorable underlying trends in our gross margin and operating expense profile,” commented Taylor Harris, Chief Executive Officer of Cutera, Inc. “We remain focused on expanding access to AviClear, our breakthrough technology for the treatment of acne, through training and education, practice development, and clinical indication expansion.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nConsolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $32.5 million, a decrease of 30% compared to the third quarter 2023. Revenue in the third quarter of 2023 included skincare revenue of $7.1 million; following the termination of our skincare distribution agreement in February 2024, the third quarter of 2024 did not include skincare revenue. Revenue related to capital systems sales declined 17%, while recurring sources of revenue, excluding skincare, declined 19%. \n\nGross profit was $1.8 million, or 6% of revenue for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a gross profit of $6.5 million, or 14% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit was $3.7 million, or 12% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.0 million, or 19%, for the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit in the third quarter, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, was negatively affected by $10.1 million, or 31% of revenue, of non-cash expense related to excess and obsolete inventory. \n\nOperating expenses were $38.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $47.4 million in the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $34.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $39.8 million for the prior year period. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, include a $5.4 million charge related to doubtful accounts receivable. The Company no longer adjusts for costs related to a retention plan implemented in April 2023, in its Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Accordingly, the Company has not adjusted for $0.4 million of retention plan costs incurred in the third quarter of 2024. Further, the Company has revised the presentation of current and prior year periods to remove adjustments related to retention plan costs of $4.0 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, and $1.4 million and $4.3 million, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nGAAP operating loss was $36.2 million and $40.9 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Non-GAAP operating loss was $31.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a Non-GAAP operating loss of $30.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, were $59.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $84.3 million as of June 30, 2024. \n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nManagement is reaffirming full-year revenue guidance of $140 million to $145 million, as well as guidance for year-end 2024 cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $40 million. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company’s management will host a conference call to discuss these results and related matters today at 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET). Participating in the call will be Taylor Harris, Chief Executive Officer, Stuart Drummond, Interim Chief Financial Officer, and Shelby Eckerman, Vice President, Finance. \n\nParticipants can register for the conference call at this [registration link](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdpregister.com%2Fsreg%2F10192631%2Ffd78dddd08&esheet=54148654&newsitemid=20241107740612&lan=en-US&anchor=registration+link&index=1&md5=d963d06d9baa3ab0d84363db6cff5b77).

For over 25 years, Cutera has strived to improve lives through medical aesthetic technologies that are driven by science and powered through partnerships. For more information, call 1-888-4-CUTERA or visit [Cutera.com.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cutera.com%2F&esheet=54148654&newsitemid=20241107740612&lan=en-US&anchor=Cutera.com.&index=3&md5=e8e986c96fe430dec9b4eb0da92158bd)\n\n_*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures_\n\n_In this press release, to supplement the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), management has disclosed certain non-GAAP financial_ _measures for gross profit, gross margin rate,__and income or loss from operations. Non-GAAP adjustments include depreciation and amortization including contract acquisition costs, stock-based compensation, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) implementation costs, certain legal and litigation costs, costs associated with restructuring activities and the separation of its officers and other executives, gain on termination of a distribution agreement, and certain other adjustments. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Company may exclude if the Company believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure._\n\n_The Company defines non-GAAP operating income (loss), also commonly known as adjusted EBITDA, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, ERP implementation costs, certain legal and litigation costs, severance, gain on early termination of distribution agreement, and other adjustments._\n\n_Company management uses non-GAAP financial measures as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter, and year to year, and for benchmarking against other similar companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the operating performance measure as prescribed by GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures for the statement of operations and net income per share exclude the following:_\n\n**_Depreciation and amortization, including contract acquisition costs._**_The Company has excluded depreciation and amortization expense in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges to current operations;_\n\n**_Stock-based compensation._**_The Company has excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the Company's employees, the Company continues to evaluate its business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. The Company records stock-based compensation expenses related to grants of options, employee stock purchase plans, and performance and restricted stock. Depending upon the size, timing, and terms of the grants, this expense may vary significantly but will recur in future periods. The Company believes that excluding stock-based compensation better allows for comparisons to its peer companies;_\n\n**_ERP implementation costs._**_The Company has excluded ERP system costs related to direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with its multi-phase implementation of a new ERP solution and the related technology infrastructure costs. The Company excludes these costs because it believes that these items do not reflect future operating expenses and will be inconsistent in amounts and frequency, making it difficult to contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s operating performance;_\n\n**_Certain legal and litigation costs._**_The Company has excluded costs incurred related to its litigation against Lutronic Aesthetics as well as the settlement of $5.8 million, which is not part of the Company’s ordinary course of business. The Company’s complaint against Lutronic alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), interference with contractual relations and other claims. The Company excludes these costs as well as the settlement because this litigation is a result of a discrete event that was not part of the Company’s business strategy, but has a significant effect on the results of operations. The costs are incidental to and do not reflect the efficiencies and effectiveness of the Company’s core operations;_\n\n**_Severance._**_The Company has excluded costs associated with restructuring activities and the separation of its officers and other executives in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP Operating Income. The Company has excluded restructuring costs because a restructuring represents a discrete event that signifies a change in the Company’s strategy, but these costs are not indicative of the ongoing financial performance of the business. The Company excludes executive separation costs because executive separations are unpredictable and not part of the Company’s business strategy but could have a significant impact on the results of operations;_\n\n**_Gain on early termination of distribution agreement._**_The Company has excluded a gain recorded in connection with the early termination of a distribution agreement with ZO USA in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating income (loss). The Company recorded the net gain of $9.7 million in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company has excluded this gain as it is not indicative of the ongoing financial performance of the business, and not part of the Company’s business strategy._\n\n_The Company believes that excluding all of the items above allows users of its financial statements to better review and assess both current and historical results of operations. The Company no longer adjusts for costs related to a retention plan implemented in April 2023, as such costs represent a normal, recurring, operating cost, and accordingly, has not adjusted for $0.4 million of retention plan costs incurred in the third quarter of 2024. Further, the Company has revised the presentation of the prior year periods to remove adjustments for retention plan costs of $1.4 million and $4.3 million, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively._\n\n_Safe Harbor Statement_\n\n_Certain statements in this press release, other than purely historical information, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements include but are not limited to express or implied statements regarding expanding access to AviClear, and full year revenues and cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, along with other express or implied statements regarding Cutera’s plans, objectives, strategies, financial performance, guidance and outlook, product launches and performance, trends, prospects, or future events. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as, but not limited to, “may,” “could,” “seek,” “guidance,” “predict,” “potential,” “likely,” “believe,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “forecast,” “foresee” or variations of these terms and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict and may cause Cutera's actual results to differ materially from the express or implied forward-looking statements herein. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and stockholders should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. There are several risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond Cutera’s control, that could cause its actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including risks involved with continued expansion of AviClear, Cutera’s financial position and debt service requirements, and making financial projections, as well as the other risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other documents filed from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission by Cutera._\n\n_All statements made in this release are made only as of the date set forth at the beginning of this release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Cutera undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date they were made, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

(Nasdaq: CUTR), a leading provider of aesthetic and dermatology solutions, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n  * Consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2024 of $34.4 million\n  * Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $84.3 million\n  * AviClear growth of 41% vs prior year period driven by international capital system sales \n  * Service growth of 7% vs prior year period, highlighting improvements in field service and overall customer support \n  * Completion of the Q4 2023 corporate restructuring program, and announcement of additional cost reduction initiatives, allowing for both improved cost structure and better organization alignment \n\n\n\n“The second quarter was challenging for Cutera and for the aesthetics industry in general. While AviClear experienced continued momentum internationally, and our launch of Xeo+ is off to a promising start, our overall performance did not meet expectations, particularly in North America,” commented Taylor Harris, Chief Executive Officer of Cutera, Inc. “We are responding to the challenging market environment with new commercial leadership in North America, additional cost reductions, and continued focus on building the AviClear franchise through training and education, cooperative marketing, launches in new international markets, and clinical indication expansion.” \n\n**Steve Kreider Promoted to Senior Vice President, North America**\n\nIn July 2024, Steve Kreider was promoted to Senior Vice President (SVP), North America, with leadership responsibility for the combined North American commercial organization, including sales, marketing and customer excellence. Mr. Kreider joined Cutera in 2022 as SVP, Global Marketing, and brings close to 20 years of experience in dermatology and aesthetics, having served in prior commercial and business development leadership roles at Ortho Dermatologics, Merz Aesthetics, and Medicis. \n\nTaylor Harris commented: “I am thrilled to appoint Steve to this role, and I’m confident that he is the right leader to unify our commercial efforts to best serve our customers. Steve brings tremendous passion for building great teams and culture, as well as deep experience in our space, all of which will serve Cutera well.” \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nConsolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $34.4 million, a decrease of 44% compared to the second quarter 2023. Revenue in the second quarter of 2023 included skincare revenue of $9.4 million and as the skincare distribution agreement was terminated in February 2024, the second quarter of 2024 did not have skincare revenue. Revenue related to capital systems sales declined 39%, while recurring sources of revenue, excluding skincare, declined 20%. \n\nGross profit was $7.6 million, or 22.2% of revenue for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a gross profit of $26.1 million, or 42.2% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit was $9.6 million, or 28.0% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $28.8 million, or 46.6%, for the second quarter of 2023. Gross profit in the second quarter, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, was negatively affected by approximately $2.4 million, or 6.9% of revenue, of expense related to excess and obsolete inventory. \n\nOperating expenses were $29.4 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $57.2 million in the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $30.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $42.1 million for the prior year period. \n\nGAAP operating loss was $21.8 million and $31.2 million for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Non-GAAP operating loss was $21.3 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of $13.2 million for the second quarter of 2024. \n\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, were $84.3 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $105.4 million as of March 31, 2024. \n\n**Cost Restructuring**\n\nDuring the second quarter, the company completed the global restructuring program that was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2023, which resulted in expense savings of approximately $20 million on an annualized basis. In addition to that program, the company has identified an additional $10 million cost reduction opportunity, which should be fully realized in 2025. \n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nManagement is revising full year revenue guidance to $140 million to $145 million, compared to previous revenue guidance of $160 million to $170 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash guidance is updated to approximately $40 million at December 31, 2024, from the Company’s previous guidance of a range from $55 million to $60 million. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company’s management will host a conference call to discuss these results and related matters today at 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET). Participating in the call will be Taylor Harris, Chief Executive Officer, Stuart Drummond, Interim Chief Financial Officer, and Shelby Eckerman, Vice President, Finance. \n\nParticipants can register for the conference call by following [registration link](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcutera.co%2Fregistrationlink&esheet=54106421&newsitemid=20240808553412&lan=en-US&anchor=registration+link&index=1&md5=de63b84a7b0b59658687ce3e3553f8b0).

For more information, call 1-888-4-CUTERA or visit [Cutera.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cutera.com%2F&esheet=54106421&newsitemid=20240808553412&lan=en-US&anchor=Cutera.com&index=3&md5=cd5cd6d3c5a2679bd638a775bf65c7b5). \n\n_*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures_\n\n_In this press release, to supplement the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, management has disclosed certain non-GAAP financial measures for gross margin, gross margin rate, and income or loss from operations. Non-GAAP adjustments include depreciation and amortization including contract acquisition costs, stock-based compensation, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) implementation costs, certain legal and litigation costs, certain executive and non-recurring severance costs, retention plan costs, gain on termination of a distribution agreement, and certain other adjustments. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Company may exclude if the Company believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure._\n\n_The Company defines non-GAAP financial measure, also commonly known as adjusted EBITDA, as operating income before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, ERP implementation costs, certain legal and litigation costs, severance, retention plan costs, gain on early termination of distribution agreement, and other adjustments._\n\n_Company management uses non-GAAP measures as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter, and year to year, and for benchmarking against other similar companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the operating performance measure as prescribed by GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures for the statement of operations and net income per share exclude the following:_\n\n**_Depreciation and amortization, including contract acquisition costs._**_The Company has excluded depreciation and amortization expense in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges to current operations;_\n\n**_Stock-based compensation._**_The Company has excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the Company's employees, the Company continues to evaluate its business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. The Company records stock-based compensation expenses related to grants of options, employee stock purchase plans, and performance and restricted stock. Depending upon the size, timing, and terms of the grants, this expense may vary significantly but will recur in future periods. The Company believes that excluding stock-based compensation better allows for comparisons to its peer companies;_\n\n**_ERP implementation costs._**_The Company has excluded ERP system costs related to direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with its multi-phase implementation of a new ERP solution and the related technology infrastructure costs. The Company excludes these costs because it believes that these items do not reflect future operating expenses and will be inconsistent in amounts and frequency, making it difficult to contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s operating performance;_\n\n**_Certain legal and litigation costs._**_The Company has excluded costs incurred related to its litigation against Lutronic Aesthetics as well as the settlement of $5.8 million, which is not part of the Company’s ordinary course of business. The Company’s complaint against Lutronic alleges misappropriation of trade secrets, violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), interference with contractual relations and other claims. The Company excludes these costs as well as the settlement because this litigation is a result of a discrete event that was not part of the Company’s business strategy, but has a significant effect on the results of operations. Its costs are incidental to and do not reflect the efficiencies and effectiveness of the Company’s core operations;_\n\n**_Severance._**_The Company has excluded costs associated with restructuring activities and the separation of its officers and other executives in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP Operating Income. The Company has excluded restructuring costs because a restructuring represents a discrete event that signifies a change in the Company’s strategy, but its costs are not indicative of the ongoing financial performance of the business. The Company excludes executive separation costs because executive separations are unpredictable and not part of the Company’s business strategy but could have a significant impact on the results of operation;_\n\n**_Retention plan costs._**_The Company has excluded the expense related to a retention plan implemented in April 2023. Approximately $11 million was made available to sales personnel and key employees._  _The Company expects the final aggregate payments under the retention plan will be approximately $7 million with the final installment occurring in October 2024. The Company has excluded expense related to this retention plan as such costs are not considered part of ongoing operations; and_\n\n**_Gain on early termination of distribution agreement._**_The Company has excluded a gain recorded in connection with the early termination of a distribution agreement with ZO USA in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating income. The Company recorded the net gain of $9.7 million in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company has excluded this gain as it is not indicative of the ongoing financial performance of the business, and not part of the Company’s business strategy._\n\n_The Company believes that excluding all of the items above allows users of its financial statements to better review and assess both current and historical results of operations._\n\n_Safe Harbor Statement_\n\n_Certain statements in this press release, other than purely historical information, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Forward-looking statements are based on management's current, preliminary expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause Cutera's actual results to differ materially from the statements contained herein. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and stockholders should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. There are several risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, that could cause its actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, including those described in the “Risk Factors” section of Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other documents filed from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission by Cutera._\n\n_All statements made in this release are made only as of the date set forth at the beginning of this release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Cutera undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or circumstances after the date they were made, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. If the Company updates one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates concerning those or other forward-looking statements.
