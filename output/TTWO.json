A live listen-only webcast of the call will be available by visiting [http://ir.take2games.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.take2games.com&esheet=54147953&newsitemid=20241106543274&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.take2games.com&index=2&md5=fea4147dcb202f8ceb636edcae531d7f) and a replay will be available following the call at the same location. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses Non-GAAP measures of financial performance: **_Adjusted Unrestricted Operating Cash Flow_** , which is defined as GAAP net cash from operating activities, adjusted for changes in restricted cash, and **_EBITDA_** , which is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding interest income (expense), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation expense, and amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles. \n\nThe Company’s management believes it is important to consider Adjusted Unrestricted Operating Cash Flow, in addition to net cash from operating activities, as it provides more transparency into current business trends without regard to the timing of payments from restricted cash, which is primarily related to a dedicated account limited to the payment of certain internal royalty obligations. \n\nThe Company’s management believes it is important to consider EBITDA, in addition to net income, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses, debt-related charges, and income taxes. Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, EBITDA is useful to investors and management in understanding the Company’s ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends and provides useful additional information relating to the Company’s operations and financial condition. \n\nThese Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These Non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies. In the future, Take-Two may also consider whether other items should also be excluded in calculating these Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company. Management believes that the presentation of these Non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information to measure Take-Two's financial and operating performance. In particular, these measures facilitate comparison of our operating performance between periods and may help investors to understand better the operating results of Take-Two. Internally, management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's operating results and in planning and forecasting. A reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is contained in the financial tables to this press release. \n\n**Final Results**\n\nThe financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis; final data will be included in Take-Two’s Quarterly Report on Form 10−Q for the period ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**About Take-Two Interactive Software**\n\nHeadquartered in New York City, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. is a leading developer, publisher, and marketer of interactive entertainment for consumers around the globe.
