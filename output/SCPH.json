(Nasdaq: SCPH), a pharmaceutical company committed to revolutionizing cardiorenal healthcare through patient-centric innovations, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n**Business Update**\n\n  * For the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, scPharmaceuticals reports: \n    * Net FUROSCIX revenue of $10.0 million, representing a 24% increase from the second quarter of 2024\n    * Approximately 10,800 FUROSCIX doses filled, representing a 16% increase from the second quarter of 2024\n    * Approximately 6.8 doses per prescription, up from 6.3 in the second quarter of 2024\n    * Approximately 3,100 unique prescribers from launch until the end of the third quarter of 2024, up approximately 14% from the end of the second quarter of 2024\n    * Gross-to-net discount of 15.7% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8% in the second quarter of 2024\n    * Received direct purchases from 14 Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs)/hospital systems year to date\n    * Price increase of FUROSCIX by 5.5% at the end of September of 2024 expected to have a positive impact on product revenues\n\n\n  * **Transformative Financing Through Profitability:** In August 2024, scPharmaceuticals announced concurrent equity, debt and royalty financings totaling up to $175 million. The transactions were comprised of a $50 million equity financing with leading life science investors, as well as both a $75 million senior debt facility and $50 million in a synthetic royalty agreement with Perceptive Advisors. The combined $175 million is anticipated to fund scPharmaceuticals’ operations through expected profitability.\n  * **NYHA Class IV Approval:** In August 2024, scPharmaceuticals announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval for FUROSCIX, expanding the indication to include New York Heart Association Class IV chronic heart failure patients.\n  * **PK/PD Data for Autoinjector:** In August 2024, scPharmaceuticals announced positive PK/PD data that met all primary and secondary endpoints. scPharmaceuticals is continuing to progress towards its targeted submission of a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA by the end of January 2025.\n  * **sNDA FUROSCIX Filing in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):** In July 2024, scPharmaceuticals announced that the FDA has accepted for filing the Company’s sNDA seeking to expand the FUROSCIX indication to include treatment of edema due to fluid overload in patients with CKD. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of March 6, 2025.\n\n\n\n“The continued growth of FUROSCIX net revenue is encouraging, particularly as we have begun to see increased penetration into the Class IV chronic heart failure patient population following the FDA`s approval of the FUROSCIX expanded indication in August. We anticipate the expansion of the sales force that we completed in late September to have a potentially meaningful impact on sales moving forward. In addition, we saw a significant increase in the FUROSCIX purchase flow from IDNs and hospital systems,” stated John Tucker, President, and Chief Executive Officer of scPharmaceuticals. “We remain committed to our FUROSCIX lifecycle initiatives, including the development of our Autoinjector. The Autoinjector is anticipated to meaningfully reduce cost of goods sold over the medium-to-long-term. We continue to advance our pre-launch activities in anticipation of our PDUFA target action date on March 6, 2025, in patients with fluid overload due to CKD. In preparation for the potential indication expansion, we have conducted in depth market research, identified key opinion leaders, and have incorporated high impact nephrology offices that are already treating heart failure patients that also have CKD into our call plan.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Product revenues were $10.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. Cost of product revenues were $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in both product revenues and cost of product revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was due to an increase in demand of FUROSCIX further into commercial launch, and related manufacturing costs.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in research and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to an increase in clinical study costs, offset by a decrease in pharmaceutical development, quality, regulatory, and employee related costs.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $21.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $14.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to costs associated with entering into the Credit Agreement and Guaranty and Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement in August 2024, employee related costs, commercial costs, patient support, and professional service costs, offset by decreases in taxes and insurance.\n\nscPharmaceuticals reported a net loss of $35.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $15.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net loss for the third quarter of 2024, was primarily due to one-time charges related to the extinguishment of debt and accounting for the new financial instruments scPharmaceuticals entered into in August 2024. scPharmaceuticals’ net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.75 per share. The $0.75 per share was burdened by one-time charges of $0.47 per share.\n\nscPharmaceuticals ended the third quarter of 2024 with $91.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $76.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, scPharmaceuticals’ total shares outstanding was 50,040,134.\n\n**Conference call and webcast information**\n\nscPharmaceuticals’ management will host a conference call and webcast to review the Company’s third quarter 2024 results today, Wednesday, November 13th, at 4:30 p.m. EST.

Serum electrolytes, CO2, BUN, creatinine, glucose, and uric acid should be monitored frequently during furosemide therapy.\n\nExcessive diuresis may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.\n\nFurosemide can cause dehydration and azotemia. If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during treatment of severe progressive renal disease, discontinue furosemide.\n\nCases of tinnitus and reversible or irreversible hearing impairment and deafness have been reported with furosemide. Reports usually indicate that furosemide ototoxicity is associated with rapid injection, severe renal impairment, the use of higher than recommended doses, hypoproteinemia or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other ototoxic drugs.\n\nIn patients with severe symptoms of urinary retention (because of bladder emptying disorders, prostatic hyperplasia, urethral narrowing), the administration of furosemide can cause acute urinary retention related to increased production and retention of urine. These patients require careful monitoring, especially during the initial stages of treatment.\n\nContact with water or other fluids and certain patient movements during treatment may cause the On-body Infusor to prematurely terminate infusion. Ensure patients can detect and respond to alarms.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions with FUROSCIX administration in clinical trials were site and skin reactions including erythema, bruising, edema, and injection site pain.\n\nFor more details, please read the full Prescribing Information at [FUROSCIX.com/prescribing-information.pdf](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QM-q7y-Jst5NDW1fV6z3iZszn4SkyNaDtWbOXid48uE2NEhOYbkUXH_B506HdpzqERcPkB-8taHrlXRbCuXrsBmKj2Ri5qNtvfD6MVDwEsNz4WxP_6iTowVlVQdpt4oqzmYS2mkt1a-5zotg9iQNv3psySbfYNs_f-q9CEot-vgI2MTg0LP3-9CGmS3bQuWUeCP7lWGw36iHwR1gJTEi3InmdU6Tpwgcp16n0VgurAQc4mMB_2wLJejUSjUa4czhvVNbeyBwH9dLmsFsa-D4C7Ns35uNm344W0pmP7n_7m9mdRJ59N4_xR0nXNopfI8k1Xx6SIk8VpMcd3A4zNbmzCuQN1zyzORWleti4OY7tUvu9vkoUaAF-ND7-HyJ2NCVqDWinTGssx8iFfoYHbWUGPrEC_sr8tL7BGZ4WyiHRdSRiw7Du9GpAb-T2IPmx9kTf9nj_iXSTC0cFDsTT2h7FqBC_cQmavyF73cYCBFxATx_9f44CcftPDfm0TPg-5rAti0Fkl45WTIQNyEj_GiuBRPtt_ZoMjp9i_T25Cd35QJZEJ2C1bHqLBcw-x3qIaExo5UVI_pAdW1dR-wg_2zLfEWgbVfn4I5tdL6rHh0fBRR56ZX413d28hvF7J6DeL1s) and Instructions for Use at [FUROSCIX.com/instructions-for-use.pdf](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QM-q7y-Jst5NDW1fV6z3icY6T-098qXM3emdmU0yjSfPyrfcxFaqbD-N46FR5fW_VRf6zaO7ZtXWibBIvuQxnWajayLSHAbsPpV8pXFlMtobVfsVGNjdWNg145cJwBQfsGQOWbUY_hZ-OakdDPxDHyVJlv5dYxyY47BhqvOMucC86fQbcKWg8H_Rr5Rdx_TavA0ZPZ1sS5oYm4bQ_rCJxLsPkS50fOr7toOViutHt1Qyk47Ubech1akiVh-aPCN0ZHIpTUdPDvDDZ0DwYvDqHp49ly0yyqL10h-6H2GlqyAWj6Vq1dA7WC9xwabXY-KDeNdb3Au0WaM9Ns6339s05oGETz1XUcwEsC2KPBHPh80WileaH7dzqPUa1KYJHrAj1dOoJR4xyXVIeZcuoDzo-dulrGDU_NLqlvc6EfA_qPrjGvXwQqKNVkNdIUkwxQUz-WeyTPjSYtEymWaPHr1TJTfQ8kSVtJv8Z72OkIlRmpJdmch_W2ZGL4QDevYvwJRCFnsHbRmI8PYcnsnlL4kRzQm4x833e_Q1HSkXCxnYGwjk5PbekKjKWj2muWsrgvBPbmt1Zxuai_-hVjIWWkGbWrxXXfoE0o_X6dAfHz0kzbkaGdGeGF7g3iLFrOvHLtWI).\n\n**About scPharmaceuticals**\n\nAt scPharmaceuticals, we are powered by passion, driven by patient care.

He currently serves as partner of Lincoln Nephrology and Hypertension in Lincoln, NE, and as Medical Director of O Street: DCL, Dialysis Clinics of Lincoln in Lincoln NE. In addition, he teaches nephrology rotations for the Lincoln Family Medicine Residency Program in Lincoln, NE (affiliated with the University of Nebraska Medical School in Omaha, Nebraska). Dr. Aaronson graduated from the University of Connecticut School of Medicine and completed both his residency (internal medicine) and his fellowship (nephrology and hypertension) at the University of Minnesota.\n\n**FUROSCIX****®****(furosemide injection) 80 mg/10mL for subcutaneous use**\n\nFUROSCIX® is indicated for the treatment of congestion due to fluid overload in adult patients with chronic heart failure.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\nFUROSCIX is contraindicated in patients with anuria, patients with a history of hypersensitivity to furosemide, any component of the FUROSCIX formulation or medical adhesives and in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.\n\nFurosemide may cause fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic abnormalities, particularly in patients receiving higher doses, patients with inadequate oral electrolyte intake, and in elderly patients. Serum electrolytes, CO2, BUN, creatinine, glucose, and uric acid should be monitored frequently during furosemide therapy.\n\nExcessive diuresis may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.\n\nFurosemide can cause dehydration and azotemia. If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during treatment of severe progressive renal disease, discontinue furosemide.\n\nCases of tinnitus and reversible or irreversible hearing impairment and deafness have been reported with furosemide. Reports usually indicate that furosemide ototoxicity is associated with rapid injection, severe renal impairment, the use of higher than recommended doses, hypoproteinemia or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other ototoxic drugs.\n\nIn patients with severe symptoms of urinary retention (because of bladder emptying disorders, prostatic hyperplasia, urethral narrowing), the administration of furosemide can cause acute urinary retention related to increased production and retention of urine. These patients require careful monitoring, especially during the initial stages of treatment.\n\nContact with water or other fluids and certain patient movements during treatment may cause the On-body Infusor to prematurely terminate infusion. Ensure patients can detect and respond to alarms.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions with FUROSCIX administration in clinical trials were site and skin reactions including erythema, bruising, edema, and injection site pain.\n\nFor more details, please read the full Prescribing Information at [FUROSCIX.com/prescribing-information.pdf](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mVkivnwJ7ETiBsXhiQRqf9uGl--GX-K4PBYcplXELCecT3RXT4WeaQ4gKrgK5TNUNgZgy346WMErlrL59VpD5NHwyiLeyo2xaXT4SHtjmiv6qPilekAKDMM0AMObwN3uS2JKTmdPSTivriQd5r64Rw==) and Instructions for Use at [FUROSCIX.com/instructions-for-use.pdf](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mVkivnwJ7ETiBsXhiQRqfzrbygo34Qtwh3G6ZgYNImaQl4fnAbOt5eFe1TMI_bvxtDHe1zC32vL1dLBBPNoadFYnUE-rbLIpQB-fJO3zcQvfTgExjz1e7SNb8gHg77x-tVkOIdFzpbEY8Ysmk91hoQ==).\n\n**About scPharmaceuticals**\n\nscPharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products that are designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes.
