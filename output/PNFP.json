Right Time. Right Model.\n\n![](images/headshot-ceos.jpg)\n\n## Dear Fellow Shareholders\n\nThat we've been able to grow TBV per share and create such healthy value for shareholders isn't due to cost cutting. We didn't take market share or grow deposits and loans by going all-in on pricing competition or mass marketing. We simply ran the same old playbook that's built our success since 2000, one that's more relevant now than it ever has been.\n\n[Read the shareholder letter](message-to-shareholders.html)\n\n![](images/figure-excited-associates.jpg)\n\n## Excited Associates\n\nBy applying a different set of values to an age-old industry, Pinnacle's founders set in motion a market disruption that has endured through changing regulatory and economic environments. We earn business and loyalty by attracting the most experienced, high-performing bankers in our markets and assimilating them into a culture that loves them and a bank they're eager to introduce to their clients.\n\n[Learn more about our Excited Associates](excited-associates.html)\n\n97.2%\n\nThis is a great firm where associates want to work.\n\n97.4%\n\nThere are associates here who I consider my friend.\n\n96.0%\n\nOur firm's culture is special — something you don't find just anywhere.\n\n> \"Never has been and never will be a better company to work for.\"\n\n![](images/figure-engaged-clients.jpg)\n\n## Engaged Clients\n\nTo earn long-term loyalty, you need something much more meaningful than price. You need to deliver a service experience clients can't get anywhere else and a deep relationship with a trusted partner who will always have their back. Those factors are the difference between winning shallow, transactional business and earning a fully engaged client who sticks with and actively advocates for their favorite bank.\n\n[Superior client service in Engaged Clients](engaged-clients.html)\n\n85%\n\nOverall Satisfaction\n\n92%\n\nBank You Can Trust\n\n91%\n\nValues Long-term Relationships\n\n> \"After years of rotating personnel and lack of coordinated service at a larger bank, we have been totally happy with Pinnacle.\"\n\n![](images/figure-enriched-shareholders.jpg)\n\n## Enriched Shareholders\n\nOur unusual approach of investing in our business even during challenging times—particularly in terms of acquiring new talent—is one of the primary reasons we've been able to take market share and grow balance sheet volumes. That, in turn, has created rapid and reliable growth in revenue and earnings, which we believe accounts for our extraordinary total shareholder return over nearly two and a half decades.\n\n[Learn more about our Enriched Shareholders](enriched-shareholders.html)\n\n20%\n\nShareholder Return\n\n$7.14\n\nFully Diluted EPS\n\n$51.38\n\nTBV per Common Share\n\n> \"Pinnacle has delivered for associates, clients and shareholders because we invest in growth, even during difficult times.

The only one making gains is the Southeast: from Texas to Maryland and Kentucky to Florida. This is Pinnacle territory. We are in most of the biggest and fastest growing markets in the Southeast, which is the fastest growing region in the country. The cities in our footprint have continued to grow as coastal cities and money centers began to shrink. They've also experienced a remarkable recovery from the lows of 2020.\n\n[View the Map](map.html)\n"
