Reich. “This year we have advanced our SAB-142 Type 1 diabetes program from preclinical through Phase I to Phase II ready, which illustrates SAB management’s ability to execute our business strategy according to plan. Enthusiasm for SAB-142 continues to grow among clinical advisors and the T1D patient community as the program advances, and we are well-positioned and on schedule for initiating a Phase II study in 2025.” \n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n  * SAB provided a clinical trial progress update on September 9, 2024 at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting. \n    * The update confirmed that SAB-142 has completed Phase 1 enrollment of all planned cohorts in healthy volunteers.\n    * SAB is now progressing to enroll patients with T1D in the last cohort of the study to establish safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity profile of SAB-142 in patients with T1D prior to initiation of an upcoming Phase II SAFEGUARD study in patients with new-onset T1D.\n    * Further, the target dose of SAB-142 2.5mg/kg is complete with no observation of serum sickness.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * SAB-142 remains on track for a topline Phase 1 data readout by the end of the year.\n\n\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Updates**\n\n**Financial Guidance:** Based on its current operating plans, if the Company receives funds upon the exercise of all outstanding Tranche B warrants, SAB would have cash sufficient to fund its operations into 2026.\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale securities totaled $30.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $56.6 million as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was driven primarily by continued research and related expenses as the Company advances its lead therapeutic candidates.\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses: **R&D expenses were $7.8 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. R&D expenses were $22.6 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to prioritizing focus in the autoimmunity space with SAB-142, a disease-modifying fully human hIgG aimed at preventing onset or disease progression of T1D.\n  * **General and Administrative Expense:** G&A expenses were $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. G&A expenses were $11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. G&A expenses grew primarily due to increased headcount to support the Company’s continued research activities and development of its product candidates.\n  * **Non-operating Income:** Non-operating income was $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-operating income was $10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.1 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities and an Australian research and development tax credit.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, for an earnings per basic and diluted share of $(1.12), as compared to a net loss of $5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 for an earnings per basic and diluted share of $(0.97). Net loss was $22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, for an earnings per basic and diluted share of $(2.45), as compared to a net loss of $19.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for an earnings per basic and diluted share of $(3.79).\n\n\n\n**About SAB BIO**\n\nSAB BIO (SAB) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing human, multi- targeted, high-potency immunoglobulins (IgGs), without the need for human donors or convalescent plasma, to treat and prevent immune and autoimmune disorders. The Company’s lead asset, SAB-142, targets T1D with a disease-modifying therapeutic approach that aims to change the treatment paradigm by delaying onset and potentially preventing disease progression.
