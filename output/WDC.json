Cloud revenue increased 17% (QoQ), Client and Consumer revenue remained flat (QoQ).\n  * First quarter GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was $1.35 and Non-GAAP EPS was $1.78.\n  * Expect fiscal second quarter 2025 revenue to be in the range of $4.20 billion to $4.40 billion.\n  * Expect Non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.75 to $2.05.\n\n\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2024-- Western Digital Corp. (Nasdaq: WDC) today reported fiscal first quarter financial results.\n\n“Western Digital’s performance in the fiscal first quarter demonstrates our commitment to operational excellence and disciplined capital investment as our focus on lasting quality and reliability, driven by industry leading innovation and a diversified portfolio, has allowed us to target the most attractive end markets to improve profitability,” said David Goeckeler, Western Digital CEO. “The strength of our diversified product portfolio is demonstrated by the rapid emergence of enterprise SSD as a core pillar of growth within our Flash business.

On a sequential and year-over-year basis, the increases were driven by higher nearline shipments in HDD and enterprise SSD bit shipments to data center customers.\n  * Client represented 29% of total revenue. Compared to last quarter, Flash bit shipment growth in gaming and mobile was offset by a decline in PC OEM, while HDD revenue was flat. Year-over-year, an increase in Flash revenue was primarily due to higher ASPs as bit shipments declined, and was partially offset by lower HDD revenue.\n  * Consumer represented 17% of total revenue. Sequentially, a slight growth in HDD offset a decline in Flash driven by softer consumer demand. Year over year, the decrease was due to lower Flash and HDD bit shipments partially offset by improved pricing in both Flash and HDD.\n\n\n\n**Business Outlook for Fiscal Second Quarter of 2025**\n\n**Three Months Ending**  \n---  \n**December 27, 2024**  \n**GAAP(1)**| **Non-GAAP(1)**  \nRevenue ($B)| $4.20 - $4.40| $4.20 - $4.40  \nGross margin| 36.5% - 38.5%| 37.0% - 39.0%  \nOperating expenses ($M)| $835 - $855| $695 - $715  \nInterest and other expense, net ($M)| ~ $115| ~ $110  \nTax rate**(2)**|  N/A| 15.0% - 17.0%  \nDiluted earnings per share| N/A| $1.75 - $2.05  \nDiluted shares outstanding (in millions)| ~ 357| ~ 357  \n_______________  \n---  \n(1) Non-GAAP gross margin guidance excludes stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets and amortization of patent licenses related to a litigation matter, totaling approximately $20 million to $30 million. The company’s Non-GAAP operating expenses guidance excludes stock-based compensation expense and expenses related to business separation costs, totaling approximately $130 million to $150 million. Non-GAAP Interest and other income (expense) guidance excludes approximately $5 million of interest expense related to a litigation matter. In the aggregate, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance excludes these items totaling $155 million to $185 million. The timing and amount of these charges excluded from Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share cannot be further allocated or quantified with certainty. Additionally, the timing and amount of additional charges the company excludes from its Non-GAAP tax rate and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are dependent on the timing and determination of certain actions and cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, full reconciliations of Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, Non-GAAP tax rate and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures (gross margin, operating expenses, tax rate and diluted earnings per share, respectively) are not available without unreasonable effort.  \n(2) Non-GAAP tax rate is determined based on a percentage of Non-GAAP pre-tax income or loss. Our estimated Non-GAAP tax rate may differ from our GAAP tax rate (i) due to differences in the tax treatment of items excluded from our Non-GAAP net income or loss; (ii) the fact that our GAAP income tax expense or benefit recorded in any interim period is based on an estimated forecasted GAAP tax rate for the full year, excluding loss jurisdictions; and (iii) because our GAAP taxes recorded in any interim period are dependent on the timing and determination of certain GAAP operating expenses.  \n  \n**Accounting Assessment for Recent Development in Litigation Matter**\n\nOn October 18, 2024, a jury returned a verdict in a patent infringement case against the company in the amount of $316 million. The company believes it has meritorious arguments to the verdict and believes it will ultimately prevail in this legal proceeding. The company is currently evaluating the appropriate accounting treatment for this matter, and the financial information reported in this press release does not include any impact related to these recent developments, pending completion of that assessment. The company expects to complete its accounting assessment in connection with the preparation of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which it expects to file on or before November 6, 2024. As a result, the financial information included in that report may differ from the preliminary fiscal first quarter US GAAP financial results reported in this press release. The company does not expect a change to its reported Non-GAAP financial results in connection with its assessment of this matter.\n\n**Investor Communications**\n\nThe investment community conference call to discuss these results and the company’s business outlook for the fiscal second quarter of 2025 will be broadcast live online today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific/4:30 p.m. Eastern.

These Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from Non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The company believes the presentation of these Non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors for measuring the company’s earnings performance and comparing it against prior periods. Specifically, the company believes these Non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors as they exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results or because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the company and its peers. As discussed further below, these Non-GAAP measures exclude, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense; business separation costs; charges related to a litigation matter; employee termination, asset impairment, and other; expenses related to our strategic review; amortization of acquired intangible assets; other adjustments; and income tax adjustments and the company believes these measures along with the related reconciliations to the GAAP measures provide additional detail and comparability for assessing the company’s results. These Non-GAAP measures are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing the company’s performance and planning and forecasting future periods. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.\n\nAs described above, the company excludes the following items from its Non-GAAP measures:\n\nStock-based compensation expense. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the company’s control, the company believes excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the company’s peers, a majority of whom also exclude stock-based compensation expense from their Non-GAAP results.\n\nBusiness separation costs. The company incurred expenses associated with the separation of its HDD and Flash business units to create two independent, public companies. The company believes these charges do not reflect the company’s operating results and that they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business.\n\nLitigation matter. The company has recognized expenses related to a recent judgment in a patent litigation matter, which consisted of an award of damages, prejudgment interest, and estimated plaintiff legal costs. The company also recognized expenses in its cost of revenue related to the amortization of patent licenses that the company has capitalized related to this litigation matter. The company believes these charges do not reflect the company's operating results and that they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business. For further information regarding the litigation matter, see Note 17 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 20, 2024.\n\nEmployee termination, asset impairment, and other. From time-to-time, in order to realign the company’s operations with anticipated market demand or to achieve cost synergies from the integration of acquisitions, the company may terminate employees and/or restructure its operations. From time-to-time, the company may also incur charges from the impairment of intangible assets and other long-lived assets. In addition, the company may record credits related to gains upon sale of property due to restructuring or reversals of charges recorded in prior periods. In addition, the company has taken actions to reduce the amount of capital invested in facilities, including the sale-leaseback of facilities. These charges or credits are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and the company believes they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business.\n\nStrategic review. The company incurred expenses associated with its review of strategic alternatives that resulted in the planned separation of its HDD and Flash business units to create two independent, public companies. The company believes these charges do not reflect the company’s operating results and that they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business.\n\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. The company incurs non-cash expenses from the amortization of acquired intangible assets over their economic lives. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the company’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges.\n\nOther adjustments. From time-to-time, the company sells or impairs investments or other assets which are not considered necessary to its business operations, or incurs other charges or gains that the company believes are not a part of the ongoing operation of its business. The resulting expense or benefit is inconsistent in amount and frequency.\n\nIncome tax adjustments. Income tax adjustments include the difference between income taxes based on a forecasted annual Non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax rate as a result of the timing of certain Non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments. The income tax adjustments also include adjustments to estimates related to the current status of the rules and regulations governing the transition to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the re-measurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to tax positions taken in prior quarters, including interest. These adjustments are excluded because the company believes that they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its ongoing business.\n\nAdditionally, free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, net, and the activity related to Flash Ventures, net. The company considers free cash flow generated in any period to be a useful indicator of cash that is available for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the company’s business, making strategic acquisitions, repaying debt and strengthening the balance sheet.\n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241024042423r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241024042423/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241024042423/en/)\n\n**Western Digital Corp. ****Investor Contact:** T.
