Imagine a future where no physical card numbers are needed for purchases. Where passwords or one-time codes are obsolete, and secure on-device biometrics allow seamless authentication across devices and websites, ensuring personal data stays on the device. This vision is already becoming a reality today in major markets and is poised to become ubiquitous within a few short years. \n\nBy 2030, Mastercard aims to eliminate the need for manual card entry and one-time or static passwords by combining tokenization, introduced ten years ago to protect sensitive personal and payment data, with biometric authentication for secure, seamless checkout. In doing so, Mastercard seeks to ensure that every online transaction across its network can be tokenized and authenticated, making online checkout smoother and safer. \n\nEven with the rise of cutting-edge digital payment solutions, online shopping still faces challenges and points of friction. Fraud rates are seven times higher online than in stores 1 , as criminals exploit exposed card numbers, creating headaches for cardholders and huge losses for merchants and card issuers. Plus, according to Mastercard research 2 , nearly two-thirds of shoppers still struggle through manually entering their card details, with 25% of carts abandoned because checkout is too complex or slow. \n\nPaving the way for safer and quicker payments for everyone, this vision also unlocks a new era for physical cards by making the possibility of numberless physical cards the default, further reducing the risk of fraud should a card be lost or stolen. \n\nMastercard’s technology is already making online checkout quicker for businesses. Today, tokenization is reducing cart abandonment and growing transaction approvals by 3-6 percentage points across regions and generating up to $2 billion in additional global sales for merchants each month 3 . Additionally, the risk of fraud is minimized. These advancements provide significant benefits to the wider ecosystem, including banks, consumers, and businesses. \n\n“Just like the transition from signing and swiping to tapping cards, we’re now moving from manual entry and passwords to seamless and secure payments in just a few clicks. With this shift we are protecting sensitive data through advanced encryption and tokenization technologies,” said Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard. “As payments continue to be embedded across a range of commerce experiences, we’re leading the way to a global economy that empowers everyone – providing consumers with greater control, convenience and peace-of-mind while unlocking new sales for merchants, and lowering fraud for issuers.” \n\nCore to this commitment to bring these new technologies together by 2030 is continued partnership and momentum across the payments ecosystem, as well as enablement via the [Mastercard Gateway](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mastercard.com%2Fgateway.html&esheet=54152397&newsitemid=20241113707114&lan=en-US&anchor=Mastercard+Gateway&index=1&md5=6cb002bc7836ecae2debb9526c7eefa4). Today, Mastercard is working with a range of players to deploy and scale these technologies: \n\n  * Today, more than 30% of Mastercard transactions worldwide are tokenized 4 through **Mastercard Digital Enablement Service (MDES)** , with key markets like India already nearing 100% for e-commerce. \n  * The **Mastercard Payment Passkey Service** , which was first rolled out to millions of consumers in India, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, continues to scale globally. Leading banks, payment aggregators and online merchants, including Axis Bank, BigBasket, Juspay, noon Payments, Lenskart, Razorpay, PayU and Tap Payments today are deploying the technology. \n  * **Click to Pay** is rapidly expanding as issuers like Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ING Spain, NatWest, Santander Mexico, and more enroll their card portfolios. Acquirers, payment service providers and other channel partners including Adyen, Prestashop, Worldline and Yuno are also enabling this technology. And consumers are using Click to Pay to make everyday purchases at international merchants including Arcos Dorados, Just Eat Takeaway.com, Nando’s, and Pizza Hut. \n\n\n\nMastercard continues to innovate for the speed of life – delivering solutions and collaboration to fuel breakthroughs that actually break through. This move builds upon several efforts from Mastercard to reimagine the card – in 2021, the company was the first payments network to formally [phase out the magnetic stripe](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mastercard.com%2Fnews%2Fperspectives%2F2021%2Fmagnetic-stripe%2F&esheet=54152397&newsitemid=20241113707114&lan=en-US&anchor=phase+out+the+magnetic+stripe&index=2&md5=ff4f3e2115dacea7046549cb6c3ba12f) in favor of newer and more secure technologies. \n\n**About Mastercard (NYSE: MA)** Mastercard powers economies and empowers people in 200+ countries and territories worldwide.

The increase was attributable to\ngrowth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions.\n▪ Payment network net revenue increased 10%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Primary\ndrivers of the increase were as follows:\n• Gross dollar volume growth of 10%, on a local currency basis, to $2.5 trillion.\n• Cross-border volume growth of 17% on a local currency basis.\n• Switched transactions growth of 11%.\nThis increase in payment network net revenue includes growth in payment network rebates and\nincentives provided to customers. Payment network rebates and incentives increased 17%, or\n19% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to an increase in our key drivers as well as new\nand renewed deals.\n▪ Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 18%, or 19% on a currency-neutral\nbasis. The increase was driven primarily by growth in our underlying key drivers, strong demand\nfor our consulting and marketing services, the scaling of our fraud and security and our identity\nand authentication solutions, and pricing.\n• Total operating expenses increased 25%, or 12% excluding the impact of Third Quarter Special Items.\nThe increase in as-reported operating expenses was primarily due to higher general and administrative\nexpenses (including a restructuring charge in the third quarter of 2024) and litigation provisions. The\nincrease in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to higher general and administrative\nexpenses.\n• Other income (expense) was unfavorable $55 million versus the year ago period, primarily due to\nunrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities. Adjusted other income\n(expense) was favorable $3 million versus the prior year.\n• The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 15.6%, versus 15.0% for the comparable period\nin 2023. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 16.3%, versus 15.0% for the\ncomparable period in 2023. Both the as-reported and as-adjusted effective tax rates were higher than\nthe prior year rates primarily due to our ability in 2023 to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated\nin 2022 and 2023, partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance in 2023 as well as a\nchange in our geographic mix of earnings in the current period.\n• As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s customers had issued 3.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-\nbranded cards.\n2\nYear-to-date Results\nYear-to-date Operating Results Increase / (Decrease)\n$ in billions, except per share data Reported Currency-\n2024 2023 GAAP neutral\nNet revenue $20.7 $18.6 11% 12%\nOperating expenses $9.0 $7.9 14% 14%\nOperating income $11.6 $10.6 9% 11%\nOperating margin 56.3% 57.3% (1.0) ppt (0.8) ppt\nEffective income tax rate 16.1% 18.6% (2.4) ppt (2.4) ppt\nNet income $9.5 $8.4 13% 15%\nDiluted EPS $10.25 $8.85 16% 17%\nKey Year-to-date Non-GAAP Results 1 Increase / (Decrease)\n$ in billions, except per share data Currency-\n2024 2023 As adjusted neutral\nNet revenue $20.7 $18.6 11% 12%\nAdjusted operating expenses $8.4 $7.7 10% 10%\nAdjusted operating margin 59.2% 58.6% 0.6 ppt 0.8 ppt\nAdjusted effective income tax rate 16.6% 19.0% (2.4) ppt (2.4) ppt\nAdjusted net income $10.0 $8.6 16% 18%\nAdjusted diluted EPS $10.78 $9.08 19% 20%\n1 The Key Year-to-date Non-GAAP Results exclude the impact of gains and losses on the Company’s equity investments, special items as described on page 12 (“Year-\nto-date Special Items”) and/or the translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact of the Company’s foreign exchange derivative contracts\ndesignated as cash flow hedging instruments (specifically those that manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses).

The increase was attributable to\ngrowth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions.\n▪ Payment network net revenue increased 8%, or 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Primary drivers\nof the increase were as follows:\n• Gross dollar volume growth of 10%, on a local currency basis, to $7.2 trillion.\n• Cross-border volume growth of 17% on a local currency basis.\n• Switched transactions growth of 11%.\nThis increase in payment network net revenue includes growth in payment network rebates and\nincentives provided to customers. Payment network rebates and incentives increased 17%, or\n18% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to an increase in our key drivers as well as new\nand renewed deals.\n3\n▪ Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 17%, as reported and on a currency-\nneutral basis. The increase was driven primarily by growth in our underlying key drivers, strong\ndemand for our consulting and marketing services, and the scaling of our fraud and security and\nour identity and authentication solutions.\n• Total operating expenses increased 14%, primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses\n(including a restructuring charge in the third quarter of 2024) and litigation provisions. Excluding the\nimpact of Year-to-date Special Items, adjusted operating expenses increased 10%, both as adjusted\nand on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses.\n• Other income (expense) was favorable $37 million versus the year ago period, primarily due to an\nincrease in investment income and lower net losses related to unrealized fair market value adjustments\non marketable and nonmarketable equity securities, partially offset by increased interest expense\nrelated to our debt portfolio. Adjusted other income (expense) was favorable $12 million versus the\nprior year, primarily due to an increase in investment income, partially offset by increased interest\nexpense related to our debt portfolio.\n• The effective tax rate for year-to-date 2024 was 16.1%, versus 18.6% for the comparable period in\n2023. The adjusted effective tax rate for year-to-date 2024 was 16.6%, versus 19.0% for the\ncomparable period in 2023. Both the as-reported and as-adjusted effective tax rates were lower than\nthe prior year rates primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance in 2023, partially offset\nby our ability in 2023 to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023. Additionally, a\nchange in our geographic mix of earnings in 2024 contributed to the lower effective income tax rate\ncompared to the prior year.\nReturn of Capital to Shareholders\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Mastercard repurchased 6.3 million shares at a cost of $2.9 billion and\npaid $611 million in dividends.\nThrough September 30, 2024, Mastercard repurchased 16.5 million shares at a cost of $7.6 billion and paid\n$1.8 billion in dividends.\nQuarter-to-date through October 28, the Company repurchased 2.0 million shares at a cost of $983 million,\nwhich leaves $5.6 billion remaining under the approved share repurchase programs.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call Details\nAt 9:00 a.m. ET today, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 results.

As described more fully below, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on\nthe Company’s equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains\nand losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude\nthe impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain\none-time items, as well as the related tax impacts. The Company excludes these special items because\nmanagement evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these\nrecurring and nonrecurring items.\nIn addition, the Company presents growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current\nperiod’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results, as well as\nremoving the related impact of the Company’s foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow\nhedging instruments (specifically those that manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated\nrevenues and expenses). The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results\nwhere the functional currency is different from the Company’s U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the\ntransactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than\nthe functional currency of the entity. The impact of the related realized gains and losses resulting from the\nCompany’s foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments (specifically those\nthat manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses) is recognized in the\nrespective financial statement line item on the statement of operations when the underlying forecasted\ntransactions impact earnings.\nThe Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of operating\nperformance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. The Company’s management\nuses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical\nresults, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.\nThe Company includes reconciliations of the requisite non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon\nas substitutes for the Company’s measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n10\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations (QTD)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nEffective Diluted\nOperating Operating Other income income tax Net earnings per\nexpenses margin (expense) rate income share\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReported - GAAP $ 3,365 54.3 % $ (138) 15.6 % $ 3,263 $ 3.53\n(Gains) losses on equity investments 1 ** ** 62 (0.3) % 63 0.07\nLitigation provisions 2 (176) 2.4 % ** 0.7 % 120 0.13\nRestructuring charge 3 (190) 2.6 % ** 0.3 % 147 0.16\nAdjusted - Non-GAAP $ 2,999 59.3 % $ (75) 16.3 % $ 3,593 $ 3.89\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nEffective Diluted\nOperating Operating Other income income tax Net earnings per\nexpenses margin (expense) rate income share\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReported - GAAP $ 2,689 58.8 % $ (83) 15.0 % $ 3,198 $ 3.39\n(Gains) losses on equity investments 1 ** ** 6 — % 5 —\nAdjusted - Non-GAAP $ 2,689 58.8 % $ (78) 15.0 % $ 3,202 $ 3.39\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nOperating Effective income Net Diluted earnings\nexpenses Operating margin tax rate income per share\nReported - GAAP 25 % (4.5) ppt 0.6 ppt 2 % 4 %\n(Gains) losses on equity investments 1 ** ** (0.3) ppt 2 % 2 %\nLitigation provisions 2 (7) % 2.4 ppt 0.7 ppt 4 % 4 %\nRestructuring charge 3 (7) % 2.6 ppt 0.3 ppt 5 % 5 %\nAdjusted - Non-GAAP 12 % 0.5 ppt 1.4 ppt 12 % 15 %\nCurrency impact 4 — % 0.3 ppt 0.1 ppt 1 % 1 %\nAdjusted - Non-GAAP - currency-neutral 12 % 0.7 ppt 1.5 ppt 13 % 16 %\nNote: Tables may not sum due to rounding.\n** Not applicable\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\n1.

Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.\nDebit transactions on Maestro® and Cirrus®-branded cards and transactions involving brands other than\nMastercard are not included in the preceding tables.\nFor purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of\nbalance transfers and convenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of\npurchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the\naggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and\nconvenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards\nincludes virtual cards, which are Mastercard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical\ncards associated with them.\nThe Mastercard payment products are comprised of credit, charge, debit and prepaid programs, and data\nrelating to each type of program is included in the tables. The tables include information with respect to\ntransactions involving Mastercard-branded cards that are not switched by Mastercard and transactions for\nwhich Mastercard does not earn significant revenues.\nInformation denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency\nexchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are\ncalculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports\nperiod-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency\ninformation, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in\ncalculating such rates of change.\nThe data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions\ncolumns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-\nchecking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems. The data set forth in\nthe cards columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by\nMastercard. A portion of the data set forth in the cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio\nchanges among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in\ncertain circumstances. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s\ncustomers.\nPerformance information for prior periods can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Mastercard\nwebsite at investor.mastercard.com.\n15"

Credit and\nDebit growth was aided by the conversions of the previously announced Wells Fargo commercial\ncredit and Citizens debit migrations, respectively.\n• Outside of the U.S., volume increased 12%, with Credit growth of 10%, and Debit growth of 14%.\nOverall, Cross-border volume increased 17% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued strong\ngrowth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending.\ndracretsaM\n4202©\n3rd Quarter Switched Transactions and Cards\nOctober 31, 2024 5\nTurning to page 5, switched transactions grew 11% year-over-year in Q3. Both Card present and Card\nnot present growth rates remain strong.\nCard present growth was aided in part by an increase in contactless penetration, as contactless now\nrepresents approximately 70% of all in-person switched purchase transactions.\nIn addition, card growth was 6%.

The 5 ppt\ndifference is primarily driven by pricing in international markets and mix.\n• Transaction Processing Assessments were up 14%, while switched transactions grew 11%. The 3 ppt\ndifference is primarily due to mix and pricing.\n• Other Network Assessments were $227 million this quarter.

cash\ntransactions, and cards on a regional and global basis for Mastercard™-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided\nfor volume-based data.\nDebit transactions on Maestro® and Cirrus®-branded cards and transactions involving brands other than Mastercard are not included in\nthe preceding tables.\nFor purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and\nconvenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the\nrelevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers\nand convenience checks obtained with Mastercard- branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards,\nwhich are Mastercard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them.\nThe Mastercard payment product is comprised of credit, charge, debit and prepaid programs, and data relating to each type of program\nis included in the tables. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving Mastercard-branded cards that are not\nswitched by Mastercard and transactions for which Mastercard does not earn significant revenues.\nInformation denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local\ncurrency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange\nrate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local\ncurrency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating\nsuch rates of change.\nThe data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by\nMastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by\nMastercard’s transaction switching systems. The data set forth in the cards columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject\nto certain limited verification by Mastercard. A portion of the data set forth in the cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio\nchanges among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. All data is\nsubject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s customers. Starting in the first quarter of 2022, data related to\nsanctioned Russian banks was not reported to us and hence such amounts are not included. Subsequent to the suspension of our\nbusiness operations in Russia in March 2022, there is no Russian data to be reported.\nTo aid in understanding the underlying trends in the business due to imposed sanctions and the suspension of our business\noperations in Russia in the first quarter of 2022, we are providing supplementary information in each table to reflect adjusted growth\nrates for key operational metrics excluding activity related from Russian issued cards from current and prior periods. Additionally, as\na result of the suspension of our business operations during the first quarter of 2022, cards issued by Russian banks are no longer\nactive on our network and are therefore excluded from our card counts.\nOctober 31, 2024 Page:7\n27, 2022\nSupplemental Operational Performance 2022Q3–2024Q3\n2.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNotes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited)\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nMastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard International” and\ntogether with Mastercard Incorporated, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), is a technology company in the global payments industry.\nMastercard connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations\nworldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible.\nConsolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majority-owned and controlled entities, including any\nvariable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not\nconsidered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as marketable, equity method or measurement alternative\nmethod investments and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there\nwere no significant VIEs that required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the consolidated financial\nstatements. The Company consolidates acquisitions as of the date the Company has obtained a controlling financial interest. Intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the\n2024 presentation. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported total net revenue, operating income or net income. The\nCompany follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nThe balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023. The\nconsolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and as of September 30, 2024 are\nunaudited, and in the opinion of management, include all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for\ninterim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults to be expected for the full year.\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Reference should be made to Mastercard’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.\nNote 2. Acquisitions\nIn September 2024, Mastercard entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 100% equity interest in RF Ultimate Parent, Inc. (“Recorded\nFuture”), a global threat intelligence company, for $2.65 billion, excluding customary closing adjustments. The transaction is subject to\nregulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The Company anticipates completing the acquisition by the first quarter of\n2025. Upon completion, this acquisition is expected to add threat intelligence capabilities to Mastercard’s identity, fraud prevention, real-\ntime decisioning and cybersecurity services.\nNote 3.

The Company’s strategic investments in equity securities of publicly traded and privately held companies are\nclassified within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet (see Equity Investments section below).\nInvestments\nInvestments on the consolidated balance sheet consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nAvailable-for-sale securities $ 295 $ 286\nHeld-to-maturity securities 1 43 306\nTotal investments $ 338 $ 592\n1 Held-to-maturity securities represent investments in time deposits that mature within one year. The cost of these securities approximates fair value.\nInvestment income on the consolidated statement of operations primarily consists of interest income generated from cash, cash\nequivalents, held-to maturity and available-for-sale investment securities, as well as realized gains and losses on the Company’s investment\nsecurities. The realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 were not material.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\nThe major classes of the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities and their respective amortized cost basis and fair values were as\nfollows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross Gross Gross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nCost Gain Loss Value Cost Gain Loss Value\n(in millions)\nGovernment and agency securities $ 80 $ — $ — $ 80 $ 86 $ — $ — $ 86\nCorporate securities 213 2 — 215 200 1 (1) 200\nTotal $ 293 $ 2 $ — $ 295 $ 286 $ 1 $ (1) $ 286\nThe Company’s government and agency securities include U.S. government bonds, U.S. government sponsored agency bonds and foreign\ngovernment bonds that are denominated in the national currency of the issuing country. Corporate securities held at September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, primarily carried a credit rating of A- or better. Corporate securities are comprised of commercial paper and\ncorporate bonds. The gross unrealized gains and losses on the available-for-sale securities are primarily driven by changes in interest rates.\nFor the available-for-sale securities in gross unrealized loss positions, the Company (1) does not intend to sell the securities, (2) more likely\nthan not, will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of the unrealized losses and (3) expects that the contractual principal and\ninterest will be received. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) on the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nThe maturity distribution based on the contractual terms of the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities at September 30, 2024\nwas as follows:\nAmortized Cost Fair Value\n(in millions)\nDue within 1 year $ 149 $ 149\nDue after 1 year through 5 years 144 146\nTotal $ 293 $ 295\n14 MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q\nPART I\nITEM 1.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 7. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s financial instruments are carried at fair value, cost or amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company\nclassifies its fair value measurements of financial instruments into a three-level hierarchy (the “Valuation Hierarchy”).\nFinancial Instruments - Carried at Fair Value\nFinancial instruments carried at fair value are categorized for fair value measurement purposes as recurring or non-recurring in nature.\nRecurring Measurements\nThe distribution of the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis within the Valuation Hierarchy was as\nfollows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nQuoted Significant Quoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant Prices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable in Active Observable Unobservable\nMarkets Inputs Inputs Markets Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\n(in millions)\nAssets\nInvestment securities available-for-\nsale 1:\nGovernment and agency securities $ 42 $ 38 $ — $ 80 $ 33 $ 53 $ — $ 86\nCorporate securities — 215 — 215 — 200 — 200\nDerivative instruments 2:\nForeign exchange contracts — 34 — 34 — 36 — 36\nMarketable securities 3:\nEquity securities 186 — — 186 506 — — 506\nDeferred compensation plan 4:\nDeferred compensation assets 109 — — 109 93 — — 93\nLiabilities\nDerivative instruments 2:\nForeign exchange contracts $ — $ 153 $ — $ 153 $ — $ 104 $ — $ 104\nInterest rate contracts — 54 — 54 — 79 — 79\nDeferred compensation plan 5:\nDeferred compensation liabilities 107 — — 107 91 — — 91\n1 The Company’s U.S. government securities are classified within Level 1 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair values are based on unadjusted quoted\nprices for identical assets in active markets. The fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale non-U.S. government and agency securities and corporate\nsecurities are based on observable inputs such as quoted prices, benchmark yields and issuer spreads for similar assets in active markets and are\ntherefore included in Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy.\n2 The Company’s foreign exchange and interest rate derivative asset and liability contracts measured at fair value are based on observable inputs such as\nbroker quotes for similar derivative instruments. See Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for further details.\n3 The Company’s Marketable securities are publicly held and fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in their respective active markets.\n4 The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan where assets are invested primarily in mutual funds held in a rabbi trust, which is restricted\nfor payments to participants of the plan. The Company has elected to use the fair value option for these mutual funds, which are measured using quoted\nprices of identical instruments in active markets and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n5 The deferred compensation liabilities are measured at fair value based on the quoted prices of identical instruments to the investment vehicles selected\nby the participants. These are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n16 MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q\nPART I\nITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNonrecurring Measurements\nNonmarketable Securities\nThe Company’s Nonmarketable securities are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods after initial recognition under the\nequity method or measurement alternative method. Nonmarketable securities are classified within Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy due\nto the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value that require\nmanagement’s judgment. The Company uses discounted cash flows and market assumptions to estimate the fair value of its\nNonmarketable securities when certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. See Note 6 (Investments) for further\ndetails.\nFinancial Instruments - Not Carried at Fair Value\nDebt\nDebt instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost. The Company estimates the fair value of its debt based\non either market quotes or observable market data. Debt is classified as Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as it is generally not traded in\nactive markets. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value and fair value of debt was $18.4 billion and $17.5 billion, respectively. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the carrying value and fair value of debt was $15.7 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively. See Note 10 (Debt) for further\ndetails.\nOther Financial Instruments\nCertain other financial instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost or amortized cost basis, which approximates fair\nvalue due to their short-term, highly liquid nature. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, accounts\nreceivable, settlement assets, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, accounts payable, settlement obligations and other accrued\nliabilities.\nNote 8. Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nCustomer incentives $ 1,744 $ 1,570\nOther 1,295 1,073\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 3,039 $ 2,643\nOther assets consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nCustomer incentives $ 6,032 $ 5,170\nEquity investments 1,601 1,729\nIncome taxes receivable 883 783\nOther 677 643\nTotal other assets $ 9,193 $ 8,325\nCustomer incentives represent payments made to customers under business agreements.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe changes in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nDecember 31, Increase / September 30,\n2023 (Decrease) Reclassifications 2024\n(in millions)\nForeign currency translation adjustments 1 $ (1,119) $ 67 $ — $ (1,052)\nTranslation adjustments on net investment hedges 2 181 (105) — 76\nCash flow hedges\nForeign exchange contracts 3 (17) 1 56 40\nInterest rate contracts (118) — 3 (115)\nDefined benefit pension and other postretirement plans (25) 2 — (23)\nInvestment securities available-for-sale (1) 2 — 1\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (1,099) $ (33) $ 59 $ (1,073)\nDecember 31, Increase / September 30,\n2022 (Decrease) Reclassifications 2023\n(in millions)\nForeign currency translation adjustments 1 $ (1,414) $ (105) $ — $ (1,519)\nTranslation adjustments on net investment hedges 2 309 41 — 350\nCash flow hedges\nForeign exchange contracts 3 (8) (5) 18 5\nInterest rate contracts (123) — 4 (119)\nDefined benefit pension and other postretirement plans (11) — — (11)\nInvestment securities available-for-sale (6) 3 — (3)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (1,253) $ (66) $ 22 $ (1,297)\n1 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation\nadjustments was driven primarily by the appreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the depreciation of the Brazilian real\nagainst the U.S. dollar. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign\ncurrency translation adjustments was driven primarily by the depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar.\n2 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive gain related to the net investment hedges\nwas driven primarily by the appreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in\nthe accumulated other comprehensive gain related to the net investment hedges was driven by the depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar. See\nNote 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for additional information.\n3 Certain foreign exchange derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value\nof these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of\noperations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 13. Share-Based Payments\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted the following awards under the Mastercard Incorporated 2006\nLong Term Incentive Plan, amended and restated as of June 22, 2021 (the “LTIP”). The LTIP is a stockholder-approved plan that permits the\ngrant of various types of equity awards to employees.\nWeighted-Average\nGrant-Date\nGrants in 2024 Fair Value\n(in millions) (per option/unit)\nNon-qualified stock options 0.2 $ 165\nRestricted stock units 0.9 $ 471\nPerformance stock units 0.2 $ 512\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant-date fair value of stock options and calculates the\nexpected life and the expected volatility based on historical Mastercard information. The expected life of stock options granted in 2024 was\nestimated to be six years, while the expected volatility was determined to be 28.7%. These awards expire ten years from the date of grant\nand vest ratably over three years.\nThe fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company’s Class A common stock\nprice, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents. RSUs generally vest ratably over three years.\nThe Company uses the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to determine the grant-date fair value of performance stock units (“PSUs”)\ngranted. PSUs vest after three years from the date of grant and are subject to a mandatory one-year deferral period, during which vested\nPSUs are eligible for dividend equivalents.\nCompensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures over the shorter of the vesting period or the date the individual becomes\neligible to retire under the LTIP. The Company uses the straight-line method of attribution over the requisite service period for expensing\nequity awards.\nNote 14. Income Taxes\nThe effective income tax rates were 15.6% and 15.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher\neffective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus the comparable period in 2023, was primarily due to the\nCompany’s ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 resulting from Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”), released\nby the U.S. Department of Treasury (“Treasury”) in 2023. The higher effective income tax rate was partially offset by a $115 million discrete\ntax expense in 2023 to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits generated prior to 2022,\nas well as a change in the Company’s geographic mix of earnings in the current period.\nThe effective income tax rates were 16.1% and 18.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower\neffective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus the comparable period in 2023, was primarily due to a\ndiscrete tax expense in 2023 related to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. foreign tax credits deferred tax asset. In\n2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the U.S. tax regulations published in 2022 changed due to the foreign tax legislation\nenacted in Brazil and the Notice released by Treasury. Therefore, the Company recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023\nto establish the valuation allowance. This discrete tax expense was partially offset by the Company’s ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax\ncredits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice. Additionally, a change in the Company’s geographic mix of earnings in 2024\ncontributed to the lower effective income tax rate compared to the prior year.\nThe Company is subject to tax in the United States, Belgium, Singapore, the United Kingdom and various other foreign jurisdictions, as well\nas state and local jurisdictions. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted after considering facts and\ncircumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation. Within the next twelve\nmonths, the Company believes that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local examinations is reasonably possible and\nthat a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur. While such a change may be significant, it is not possible to\nprovide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statutes of limitation expire. The Company\nhas effectively settled its U.S. federal income tax obligations through 2014. With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to\nstate and local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2014.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit was $296 million and $431 million,\nrespectively. The decrease was primarily due to the withdrawal of a prior year refund claim, which had no impact on the consolidated\nresults of operations or financial condition.\n22 MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q\nPART I\nITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 15. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\nMastercard is a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business. Some of\nthese proceedings are based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, it is not\npossible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages, and therefore, Mastercard has not established liabilities for any of these\nproceedings, except as discussed below. When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, Mastercard\nrecords a liability and discloses the amount of the liability if it is material. When a material loss contingency is only reasonably possible,\nMastercard does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of\nloss, if such an estimate can be made. Unless otherwise stated below with respect to these matters, Mastercard cannot provide an estimate\nof the possible loss or range of loss based on one or more of the following reasons: (1) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an\namount of monetary damages or the amounts are unsupportable or exaggerated, (2) the matters are in early stages, (3) there is uncertainty\nas to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (4) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, (5) the proceedings involve multiple\ndefendants or potential defendants whose share of any potential financial responsibility has yet to be determined and/or (6) there are novel\nlegal issues presented. Furthermore, except as identified with respect to the matters below, Mastercard does not believe that the outcome\nof any individual existing legal or regulatory proceeding to which it is a party will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations,\nfinancial condition and overall business. However, an adverse judgment or other outcome or settlement with respect to any proceedings\ndiscussed below could result in fines or payments by Mastercard and/or could require Mastercard to change its business practices. In\naddition, an adverse outcome in a regulatory proceeding could lead to the filing of civil damage claims and possibly result in significant\ndamage awards. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Mastercard’s results of operations, financial condition and\noverall business.\nInterchange Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings\nMastercard’s interchange fees and other practices are subject to regulatory, legal review and/or challenges in a number of jurisdictions,\nincluding the proceedings described below. When taken as a whole, the resulting decisions, regulations and legislation with respect to\ninterchange fees and acceptance practices may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s prospects for future growth and its overall\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nUnited States. In 2005, the first of a series of complaints were filed on behalf of merchants (the majority of the complaints were styled as\nclass actions, although a few complaints were filed on behalf of individual merchant plaintiffs) against Mastercard International, Visa U.S.A.,\nInc., Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions. Taken together, the claims in the complaints were\ngenerally brought under both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibit monopolization and attempts or conspiracies to\nmonopolize a particular industry, and some of these complaints contain unfair competition law claims under state law. The complaints\nallege, among other things, that Mastercard, Visa, and certain financial institutions conspired to set the price of interchange fees, enacted\npoint of sale acceptance rules (including the “no surcharge” rule) in violation of antitrust laws and engaged in unlawful tying and bundling of\ncertain products and services, resulting in merchants paying excessive costs for the acceptance of Mastercard and Visa credit and debit\ncards. The cases were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in MDL No. 1720\n(the “U.S. MDL Litigation Cases”). The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint seeking treble damages.\nIn 2006, the group of purported merchant class plaintiffs filed a supplemental complaint alleging that Mastercard’s initial public offering of\nits Class A Common Stock in May 2006 (the “IPO”) and certain purported agreements entered into between Mastercard and financial\ninstitutions in connection with the IPO: (1) violate U.S. antitrust laws and (2) constituted a fraudulent conveyance because the financial\ninstitutions allegedly attempted to release, without adequate consideration, Mastercard’s right to assess them for Mastercard’s litigation\nliabilities. The class plaintiffs sought treble damages and injunctive relief including, but not limited to, an order reversing and unwinding the\nIPO.\nIn 2011, Mastercard and Mastercard International entered into each of: (1) an omnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing\nagreement with Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions; and (2) a\nMastercard settlement and judgment sharing agreement with a number of financial institutions. The agreements provide for the\napportionment of certain costs and liabilities which Mastercard, the Visa parties and the financial institutions may incur, jointly and/or\nseverally, in the event of an adverse judgment or settlement of one or all of the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases. Among a number of scenarios\naddressed by the agreements, in the event of a global settlement involving the Visa parties, the financial institutions and Mastercard,\nMastercard would pay 12% of the monetary portion of the settlement. In the event of a settlement involving only Mastercard and the\nfinancial institutions with respect to their issuance of Mastercard cards, Mastercard would pay 36% of the monetary portion of such\nsettlement.\nIn 2012, the parties entered into a definitive settlement agreement with respect to the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases (including with respect to\nthe claims related to the IPO) and the defendants separately entered into a settlement agreement with the individual merchant plaintiffs.\nThe settlements included cash payments that were apportioned among the defendants pursuant to the omnibus judgment sharing and\nsettlement sharing agreement described above. Mastercard also agreed to provide class members with a short-term reduction in default\ncredit interchange rates and to modify certain of its business practices, including its no surcharge rule. The court granted final approval of\nthe settlement in 2013. Following an appeal by objectors and as a result of a reversal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,\nMASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q 23\nPART I\nITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe district court divided the merchants’ claims into two separate classes - monetary damages claims (the “Damages Class”) and claims\nseeking changes to business practices (the “Rules Relief Class”). The court appointed separate counsel for each class.\nIn 2018, the parties to the Damages Class litigation entered into a class settlement agreement to resolve the Damages Class claims, with\nmerchants representing slightly more than 25% of the Damages Class interchange volume choosing to opt out of the settlement. The\nDamages Class settlement agreement became final in August 2023. Since 2018, Mastercard has reached settlements or agreements in\nprinciple to settle with over 250 opt-out merchants. These opt-out merchant settlements, along with the Damages Class settlement,\nrepresent over 90% of Mastercard’s U.S. interchange volume.\nApproximately 65 individual opt-out merchants continue to litigate, seeking treble damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. During the first\nquarter of 2024, the district court denied the defendants’ motions for summary judgment with respect to these ongoing individual opt-out\nmerchant cases, sending the cases back to their original jurisdictions for trials. In October 2024, the remaining opt-out merchants submitted\nexpert reports on liability and damages issues. The aggregate single damages claimed by these merchants total approximately $12 billion\nwith respect to their Mastercard purchase volume. Mastercard would be responsible for 36% of any Mastercard-related judgment pursuant\nto the December 2011 judgment and settlement sharing agreement discussed above. One court has scheduled a trial for cases involving six\nof the larger opt-out merchants for October 2025. The remaining opt-out merchant cases have not yet been scheduled for trial.\nIn 2021, the district court granted the Rules Relief Class’s motion for class certification. In March 2024, the parties to the Rules Relief Class\nlitigation entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the Rules Relief Class claims. The court held a preliminary settlement approval\nhearing in June 2024, and subsequently issued a decision denying approval of the settlement. The parties are in ongoing settlement\ndiscussions. The court has not yet scheduled a trial date.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Mastercard had accrued a liability of $572 million and $596 million, respectively, for the\nU.S. MDL Litigation Cases. The liability as of September 30, 2024 represents Mastercard’s best estimate of its probable liabilities in these\nmatters and does not represent an estimate of a loss, if any, if the matters were litigated to a final outcome. Mastercard cannot estimate\nthe potential liability if that were to occur.\nEurope. Since 2012, a number of United Kingdom (“U.K.”) merchants filed claims or threatened litigation against Mastercard seeking\ndamages for excessive costs paid for acceptance of Mastercard credit and debit cards arising out of alleged anti-competitive conduct with\nrespect to, among other things, Mastercard’s cross-border interchange fees and its U.K. and Ireland domestic interchange fees (the “U.K.\nMerchant claimants”). In addition, Mastercard has faced similar filed or threatened litigation by merchants with respect to interchange\nrates in other countries in Europe (the “Pan-European Merchant claimants”). Mastercard has resolved a substantial amount of these\ndamages claims through settlement or judgment. Following these settlements, approximately £0.3 billion (approximately $0.4 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2024) of unresolved damages claims remain. Mastercard continues to litigate with the remaining U.K. and Pan-European\nMerchant claimants and it has submitted statements of defense disputing liability and damages claims. A number of those matters are now\nprogressing with motion practice and discovery. A hearing involving multiple merchant cases was completed in March 2024 concerning\ncertain liability issues with respect to merchant claims for damages related to post-Interchange Fee Regulation consumer interchange fees\nas well as commercial and inter-regional interchange fees.\nIn a separate matter, Mastercard and Visa were served with a proposed collective action complaint in the U.K. on behalf of merchants\nseeking damages for commercial card transactions in both the U.K. and the European Union. In December 2023, the plaintiffs filed a revised\ncollective action application claiming damages against Mastercard in excess of £1 billion (approximately $1.3 billion as of September 30,\n2024). In June 2024, the court granted the plaintiffs’ collective action application. Mastercard’s request for permission to appeal this ruling\nwas denied.\nIn 2016, a proposed collective action was filed in the United Kingdom on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages for intra-European\nEconomic Area (“EEA”) and domestic U.K. interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by merchants between 1992 and\n2008. The complaint, which seeks to leverage the European Commission’s 2007 decision on intra-EEA interchange fees, claims damages in\nan amount that exceeds £10 billion (approximately $13 billion as of September 30, 2024). In 2021, the trial court issued a decision in which\nit granted class certification to the plaintiffs but narrowed the scope of the class. Since January 2023, the trial court has held hearings on\nvarious issues, including whether any causal connection existed between the levels of Mastercard’s intra-EEA interchange fees and U.K.\ndomestic interchange fees and regarding Mastercard’s request to narrow the number of years of damages sought by the plaintiffs on\nstatute of limitations grounds. In February 2024, the trial court ruled in Mastercard’s favor, finding no causal connection between the levels\nof Mastercard’s intra-EEA interchange fees and U.K. domestic interchange fees. The plaintiffs’ request for permission to appeal this ruling\nwas denied. In June 2024, the trial court ruled in Mastercard’s favor with respect to its request to dismiss five years of the plaintiffs’\ndamages claims on statute of limitations grounds. The plaintiffs’ request for permission to appeal this ruling was granted.\nMastercard has been named as a defendant in a proposed consumer collective action filed in Portugal on behalf of Portuguese consumers.\nThe complaint, which seeks to leverage the 2019 resolution of the European Commission’s investigation of Mastercard’s central acquiring\nrules and interregional interchange fees, claims damages of approximately €0.4 billion (approximately $0.4 billion as of September 30, 2024)\nfor interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by Portuguese merchants for a period of approximately 20 years.\nMastercard has submitted a statement of defense that disputes both liability and damages.\n24 MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q\nPART I\nITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAustralia. In 2022, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) filed a complaint targeting certain agreements entered\ninto by Mastercard and certain Australian merchants related to Mastercard’s debit program. The ACCC alleges that by entering into such\nagreements, Mastercard engaged in conduct with the purpose of substantially lessening competition in the supply of debit card acceptance\nservices. The ACCC seeks both declaratory relief and monetary fines and costs. A hearing on liability issues has been scheduled for March\n2025.\nATM Non-Discrimination Rule Surcharge Complaints\nIn 2011, a trade association of independent ATM operators and 13 independent ATM operators filed a complaint styled as a class action\nlawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against both Mastercard and Visa (the “ATM Operators Class Complaint”).\nPlaintiffs seek to represent a class of non-bank operators of ATM terminals that operate in the United States with the discretion to\ndetermine the price of the ATM access fee for the terminals they operate. Plaintiffs allege that Mastercard and Visa have violated Section 1\nof the Sherman Act by imposing rules that require ATM operators to charge non-discriminatory ATM surcharges for transactions processed\nover Mastercard’s and Visa’s respective networks that are not greater than the surcharge for transactions over other networks accepted at\nthe same ATM. Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of\nthe alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees.\nSubsequently, multiple related complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging both federal antitrust and\nmultiple state unfair competition, consumer protection and common law claims against Mastercard and Visa on behalf of different putative\nclasses of users of ATM services. The claims in these actions largely mirror the allegations made in the ATM Operators Class Complaint,\nalthough these complaints seek damages on behalf of consumers of ATM services who pay allegedly inflated ATM fees at both bank (“Bank\nATM Consumer Class Complaint”) and non-bank (“Non-bank ATM Consumer Class Complaint”) ATM operators as a result of the defendants’\nATM rules. Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the\nalleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees.\nIn 2019, the plaintiffs in all three class complaints filed with the district court their motions for class certification. In July 2023, the D.C.\nCircuit Court affirmed the district court’s previous order granting class certification. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the\ndefendants’ appeal of the certification decision.\nIn May 2024, Mastercard executed a settlement agreement with the class lawyers representing the Bank ATM Consumer Class, subject to\ncourt approval. The trial court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and has scheduled a final approval hearing for January 2025.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Mastercard recorded an accrual of $93 million in connection with this matter. The litigation with the ATM\nOperators Class and Non-bank ATM Consumer Class is ongoing. The plaintiffs in these two remaining class complaints, in aggregate, allege\nover $1 billion in single damages against all of the defendants.\nU.S. Liability Shift Litigation\nIn 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class action complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American\nExpress and Discover (the “Network Defendants”), EMVCo, and a number of issuing banks (the “Bank Defendants”) engaged in a conspiracy\nto shift fraud liability for card present transactions from issuing banks to merchants not yet in compliance with the standards for EMV chip\ncards in the United States (the “EMV Liability Shift”), in violation of the Sherman Act and California law. Plaintiffs allege damages equal to\nthe value of all chargebacks for which class members became liable as a result of the EMV Liability Shift on October 1, 2015. The plaintiffs\nseek treble damages, attorney’s fees and costs and an injunction against future violations of governing law. The district court denied the\nNetwork Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint, but granted such a motion for EMVCo and the Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district\ncourt transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases described above. In 2020,\nthe district court issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ request for class certification. The plaintiffs have submitted expert reports that\nallege aggregate single damages in excess of $1 billion against the four Network Defendants. The Network Defendants submitted expert\nreports rebutting both liability and damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submitted. In September 2024, the district\ncourt denied the Network Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.\nTelephone Consumer Protection Class Action\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) class action pending in Florida. The plaintiffs are individuals\nand businesses who allege that approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them advertising a Mastercard co-brand card issued\nby First Arkansas Bank (“FAB”). The TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various\ndefenses to the claims, and has notified FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal\nCommunications Commission (“FCC”) issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services\nthat are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ request for class certification, but narrowed the scope of the\nclass to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard’s request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plaintiffs’ motion to amend\nthe class definition and Mastercard’s cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the\nparties await the court’s decision.\nMASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q 25\nPART I\nITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. Department of Justice Investigation\nIn March 2023, Mastercard received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (“DOJ”)\nseeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act. The CID focuses on Mastercard’s\nU.S. debit program and competition with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection\nwith the CID.\nEuropean Commission Investigation\nIn August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for information from the European Commission seeking documents and information\nin connection with an investigation into alleged anti-competitive behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA. The\nrequest focuses on Mastercard’s practices regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European\nCommission in connection with the request.\nNote 16. Settlement and Other Risk Management\nMastercard’s rules guarantee the settlement of many of the payment network transactions between its customers (“settlement risk”).\nSettlement exposure is the settlement risk to customers under Mastercard’s rules due to the difference in timing between the payment\ntransaction date and subsequent settlement. For those transactions the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of\nthe settlement obligation to the extent the settlement obligation is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is\nshort-term and generally limited to a few days.\nGross settlement exposure is estimated using the average daily payment volume during the three months prior to period end multiplied by\nthe estimated number of days of exposure. The Company has global risk management policies and procedures, which include risk\nstandards, to provide a framework for managing the Company’s settlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed settlement by a\ncustomer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company’s rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the\nCompany has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company’s risk standards to enter into risk mitigation\narrangements, including cash collateral and/or forms of credit enhancement such as letters of credit and guarantees. This requirement is\nbased on a review of the individual risk circumstances for each customer. Mastercard monitors its credit risk portfolio and the adequacy of\nits risk mitigation arrangements on a regular basis. Additionally, the Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and\nstandards. As such, the amounts of estimated settlement exposure are revised as necessary.\nThe Company’s estimated settlement exposure was as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nGross settlement exposure $ 76,524 $ 75,023\nRisk mitigation arrangements applied to settlement exposure (13,222) (12,167)\nNet settlement exposure $ 63,302 $ 62,856\nMastercard also provides guarantees to customers and certain other counterparties indemnifying them from losses stemming from failures\nof third parties to perform duties. This includes guarantees of Mastercard-branded travelers cheques issued, but not yet cashed of $337\nmillion and $340 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which the Company has risk mitigation\narrangements for $272 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company enters into agreements in the\nordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in\nconnection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with the Company. Certain indemnifications do not\nprovide a stated maximum exposure. As the extent of the Company’s obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the\noccurrence of future events, the Company’s potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable. Historically, payments\nmade by the Company under these types of contractual arrangements have not been material.\nNote 17. Derivative and Hedging Instruments\nThe Company monitors and manages its foreign currency and interest rate exposures as part of its overall risk management program, which\nfocuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets\nmay have on its operating results. A primary objective of the Company’s risk management strategies is to reduce the financial impact that\nmay arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates principally through the use of both foreign exchange derivative contracts and\nforeign currency denominated debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of\ninterest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances. The Company does not\nenter into derivatives for speculative purposes.\n26 MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q\nPART I\nITEM 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts, including forwards and options, to manage the impact of foreign\ncurrency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses, which fluctuate based on currencies other than the functional currency of the\nentity. The objective of these hedging activities is to reduce the effect of movement in foreign exchange rates for a portion of revenues and\nexpenses forecasted to occur. As these contracts are designated as cash flow hedging instruments, gains and losses resulting from changes\nin fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to the\nconsolidated statement of operations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings. The terms of these contracts are for\ngenerally less than 18 months.\nIn April 2024, the Company entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to variability in cash flows related to\nforeign denominated assets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations when the hedged transactions impact earnings.\nForward points are excluded from the effectiveness assessment and are amortized to general and administrative expenses on the\nconsolidated statement of operations over the hedge period. The maximum term of these contracts was for approximately 7 years.\nIn addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the\nCompany’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances, and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a\ncash flow hedging relationship. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the respective terms of the\nhedged debt issuances.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to manage the effects of interest rate\nmovements on the fair value of the Company's fixed-rate debt and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a fair value hedging\nrelationship. Changes in fair value of these contracts and changes in fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in the hedged\nbenchmark interest rate generally offset each other and are recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations.\nGains and losses related to the net settlements of interest rate swaps are also recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statement\nof operations. The periodic cash settlements are included in operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn 2021, the Company entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge related to $1.0 billion of the 3.850% Senior Notes\ndue March 2050. In effect, the interest rate swap synthetically converts the fixed interest rate on this debt to a variable interest rate based\non the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) Overnight Index Swap Rate. The net impacts to interest expense for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge a portion of its net\ninvestment in foreign subsidiaries against adverse movements in exchange rates. The effective portion of the net investment hedge is\nrecorded as a currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Forward points are excluded from the\neffectiveness assessment and are amortized to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations over the\nhedge period. The amounts recognized in earnings related to forward points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 were not material.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had €1.7 billion and €1.6 billion euro-denominated debt outstanding\ndesignated as hedges of a portion of its net investment in its European operations. In December 2023, the Company de-designated €109\nmillion of the euro-denominated debt as net investment hedges to effectively manage changes in its net investment exposures in foreign\nsubsidiaries. The euro-denominated debt was subsequently re-designated as a net investment hedge effective April 2024. For the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded pre-tax net foreign currency gains (losses) of $(77) million\nand $(19) million and $54 million and $15 million, respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss).\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had net foreign currency gains of $76 million and $181 million, after tax,\nrespectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with this hedging activity.\nNon-designated Derivatives\nThe Company may also enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to serve as economic hedges, such as to offset possible changes in\nthe value of monetary assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations, without designating these derivative contracts as hedging\ninstruments. In addition, the Company is subject to foreign exchange risk as part of its daily settlement activities. This risk is typically\nlimited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with customers. To manage this\nrisk, the Company may enter into short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements\nfor the respective currency position. The objective of these activities is to reduce the Company’s exposure to volatility arising from gains\nand losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against its functional currencies. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair\nMASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q 27\nPART I\nITEM 1.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company estimates that the pre-tax amount of the net deferred loss on cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) at September 30, 2024 that will be reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations within the next\n12 months is not material.\nThe amount of gain (loss) recognized on the consolidated statement of operations for non-designated derivative contracts is summarized\nbelow:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in millions)\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\nGeneral and administrative $ 1 $ (4) $ 72 $ 21\nThe Company’s derivative financial instruments are subject to both market and counterparty credit risk. Market risk is the potential for\neconomic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as foreign currency\nexchange rates, interest rates and other related variables. Counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure of the counterparty to\nperform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms. The Company’s derivative contracts are subject to enforceable master netting\narrangements, which contain various netting and setoff provisions. However, the Company has elected to present derivative assets and\nliabilities on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheet. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into derivative\ncontracts with a diversified group of selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. Generally, the\nCompany does not obtain collateral related to derivatives because of the high credit ratings of the counterparties.\nMASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q 29\nPART I\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nNon-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to\nbe different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States (“GAAP”). As described more fully below, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our\nequity investments, which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as\nthe related tax impacts. Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent\nlitigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts (“Special Items”). We also present\ngrowth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures\npresented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal\nplanning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. We excluded these items because\nmanagement evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring\nitems. Operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share\nadjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency, should not be relied\nupon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\n• In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net losses of $62 million ($63 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted\nshare) and $69 million ($67 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share), respectively, primarily related to unrealized fair market value\nadjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities.\n• In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded net losses of $6 million ($5 million after tax, or an immaterial\nimpact per diluted share) and $95 million ($63 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share), respectively, primarily related to unrealized\nfair market value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities.\nSpecial Items\nLitigation provisions\n• In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded charges of $176 million ($120 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share),\nprimarily as a result of a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation. In the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded charges of $400 million ($281 million after tax, or $0.30 per diluted share),\nprimarily as a result of a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation,\nsettlements with a number of U.K. merchants and a legal provision associated with the ATM non-discrimination rule surcharge\ncomplaints.\n• In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded charges of $231 million ($156 million after tax, or $0.16 per diluted share)\nprimarily as a result of a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.\nRestructuring charge\n• In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a restructuring charge of $190 million ($147 million after tax, or\n$0.16 per diluted share). The restructuring action is intended to streamline our organization, delivering efficiencies to enable\nreinvestment in our business to support the realization of our long-term growth opportunities.\nSee Note 6 (Investments) and Note 15 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1\nof this Report for further discussion related to certain of the items discussed above.\nCurrency-neutral Growth Rates\nCurrency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both\nthe translational and transactional impacts on operating results and are non-GAAP financial measures. The impact of currency translation\nrepresents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different from our U.S. dollar reporting currency.

We believe that the\nkey metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our\nresults between periods.\nOperating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense)\nand income tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\nKey Drivers\nGross Dollar Volume (“GDV”)1 measures dollar volume of activity, including both domestic and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our\nbrands during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume;\n“purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and\n“cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience\nchecks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is\ncalculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported.\nThese exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. We report period-over-period\nrates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes\nin the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.\nCross-border Volume Growth measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S.\ndollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.\nSwitched Transactions measures the number of transactions switched by Mastercard, which is defined as the number of transactions\ninitiated and switched through our network during the period.\n1 Data used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against\ninformation provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s\ncustomers.\n34 MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q\nPART I\nITEM 2.

Assessments do not represent our net revenue.\nThe following provides additional information on our key metrics related to the payment network:\n• Domestic assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that carry the Company’s brands where the merchant country and\nthe country of issuance are the same. These assessments are primarily driven by the domestic dollar volume of activity (e.g., domestic\npurchase volume, domestic cash volume) or the number of cards issued.\n• Cross-border assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that carry the Company’s brands where the merchant country\nand the country of issuance are different. These assessments are primarily driven by the cross-border dollar volume of activity (e.g.,\ncross-border purchase volume, cross-border cash volume).\n• Transaction processing assessments are charges primarily driven by the number of switched transactions on our payment network.\nSwitching activities include:\n◦ Authorization, the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval\n◦ Clearing, the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has\nbeen successfully conducted at the point of interaction\n◦ Settlement, which facilitates the determination and exchange of funds between parties\nThese assessments can also include connectivity services and network access, which are based on the volume of data transmitted and\nthe number of authorization and settlement messages.\n• Other network assessments are charges for licensing, implementation and other franchise fees.\nThe following table provides a summary of our key metrics related to the payment network:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Increase/(Decrease) September 30, Increase/(Decrease)\nAs Currency- As Currency-\n2024 2023 reported neutral 2024 2023 reported neutral\n($ in millions)\nDomestic assessments $ 2,641 $ 2,460 7% 10% $ 7,707 $ 7,182 7% 9%\nCross-border assessments $ 2,804 $ 2,313 21% 22% $ 7,475 $ 6,211 20% 21%\nTransaction processing assessments $ 3,587 $ 3,172 13% 14% $ 9,997 $ 8,902 12% 13%\nOther network assessments $ 227 $ 229 (1)% (1)% $ 697 $ 712 (2)% (2)%\nMASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q 35\nPART I\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForeign Currency\nCurrency Impact\nOur primary revenue functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and the Brazilian real. Our overall operating results are\nimpacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than\nour U.S. dollar reporting currency.\nOur operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of\nconverting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. Changes in currency exchange\nrates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“GDV”), which is used in the calculation of our key metrics related to domestic\nassessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives. GDV is calculated based on local\ncurrency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars and euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, our key metrics\nrelated to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by\nthe strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar and euro versus local currencies. For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar,\nhowever, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar. The transactional currency impact of converting Australian dollars to our\nU.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when\nGDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 9% and 8%, respectively, while GDV on a local currency basis increased\n10% for each of the periods, versus the comparable periods in 2023. Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in our key\nmetrics related to transaction processing assessments and other network assessments as well as value-added services and solutions\nrevenue and operating expenses when the transacting currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.\nTo manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative\ncontracts and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship as discussed further in Note 17\n(Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1.\nForeign Exchange Activity\nWe incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, including settlement assets and obligations,\nthat are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. To manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter\ninto foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of our nonfunctional currency monetary\nassets and liabilities. The gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of these contracts are intended to reduce the potential\neffect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement\nof operations. The impact of this foreign exchange activity, including the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in our currency-\nneutral results.\nOur foreign exchange risk management activities are discussed further in Note 17 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part I, Item 1.\nFinancial Results\nNet Revenue\nThe components of net revenue were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nIncrease/ Increase/\n2024 2023 (Decrease) 2024 2023 (Decrease)\n($ in millions)\nPayment network $ 4,629 $ 4,210 10% $ 12,924 $ 11,933 8%\nValue-added services and solutions 2,740 2,323 18% 7,754 6,617 17%\nTotal net revenue $ 7,369 $ 6,533 13% $ 20,678 $ 18,550 11%\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue increased 13%, or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable\nperiod in 2023.

The adjusted\neffective income tax rates were 16.3% and 15.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Both the as-\nreported and as-adjusted effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were higher versus the\ncomparable period in 2023, primarily due to our ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 resulting from\nNotice 2023-55 (the “Notice”), released by the U.S. Department of Treasury (“Treasury”) in 2023. The higher effective income tax rates\nwere partially offset by a $115 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to\nU.S. foreign tax credits generated prior to 2022, as well as a change in our geographic mix of earnings in the current period.\nThe effective income tax rates were 16.1% and 18.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The adjusted\neffective income tax rates were 16.6% and 19.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Both the as-\nreported and as-adjusted effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were lower versus the\ncomparable period in 2023, primarily due to a discrete tax expense in 2023 related to changes in the valuation allowance associated with\nthe U.S. foreign tax credits deferred tax asset. In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the U.S. tax regulations published in 2022\nchanged due to the foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and the Notice released by Treasury. Therefore, we recognized a total $327\nmillion discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance. This discrete tax expense was partially offset by our ability to\nclaim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice. Additionally, a change in our geographic mix of earnings\nin 2024 contributed to the lower effective income tax rates compared to the prior year.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) Pillar 2 guidelines published to date include transition and safe\nharbor rules around the implementation of the 15% global minimum tax (the “Pillar 2 Rules”). Based on current enacted legislation, we do\nnot expect a material impact in 2024. However, in 2025, we expect the Pillar 2 Rules will primarily offset the reduction to our effective\nincome tax rate resulting from our incentive grant received from the Singapore Ministry of Finance. For the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, this incentive grant reduced our effective income tax rate by approximately 4%. We are continuously monitoring developments\nand evaluating the impacts these new rules may have on our future effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results\nof operations.\n40 MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q\nPART I\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement\nexposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations. The following table summarizes the cash,\ncash equivalents, investments and credit available to us:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(in billions)\nCash, cash equivalents and investments 1 $ 11.4 $ 9.2\nUnused line of credit $ 8.0 $ 8.0\n1 Investments include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. This amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of\n$1.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access\nto capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other\nliquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations, which include litigation provisions and credit and\nsettlement exposure.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. We guarantee the settlement of many\nof the transactions between our customers. Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical\ntrends may not be indicative of potential future losses. The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also\nbe driven by regional or global economic and market conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a\ncountry or region. See Note 16 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 for a\ndescription of these guarantees.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which\nwe are a party. For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 15 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.\nCash Flows\nThe table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 9,946 $ 7,850\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (724) $ (1,137)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (6,795) $ (7,138)\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $2,096 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus the comparable\nperiod in 2023, primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for non-cash items as well as lower cash payments for litigation\nsettlements, partially offset by higher customer incentive payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $413 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus the comparable period\nin 2023, primarily due to higher proceeds from maturities and sales of investment securities.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $343 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus the comparable period\nin 2023, primarily due to higher cash proceeds received from debt issuances, partially offset by repayments of debt and higher cash paid for\nrepurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends.\nMASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q 41\nPART I\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDebt and Credit Availability\nIn April 2024, $1 billion of principal related to the 2014 USD Notes matured and was paid. In July 2024, INR28.1 billion ($336 million as of\npayment date) of principal related to the 2023 INR Term Loan matured and was paid.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued a total of $4 billion of debt as follows:\n• In May 2024, we issued $1 billion principal amount of notes due May 2034\n• In September 2024, we issued $750 million principal amount of notes due January 2028, $1,150 million principal amount of notes due\nJanuary 2032 and $1,100 million principal amount of notes due January 2035\nThe issuances in 2024 are collectively referred to as the “2024 USD Notes”. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 USD Notes,\nafter deducting the original issue discount, underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $3.96 billion.\nOur total debt outstanding was $18.4 billion and $15.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with the earliest\nmaturity of $750 million of principal occurring in March 2025.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), under which we are authorized to\nissue up to $8 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. In conjunction with the Commercial\nPaper Program, we have a committed unsecured $8 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that expires in November 2028.\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to be used to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes,\nincluding providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers. In addition, we may borrow and repay\namounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program\nor the Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nSee Note 10 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 for further discussion on our debt and Note 15 (Debt)\nto the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nWe have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Subject to legally\navailable funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole\ndiscretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available\ncash and current and anticipated cash needs.\nAggregate payments for quarterly dividends totaled $1,842 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOn December 5, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.66 per share paid on February 9, 2024 to holders of\nrecord on January 9, 2024 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend was $616\nmillion.\nOn February 6, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.66 per share paid on May 9, 2024 to holders of record\non April 9, 2024 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend was $615 million.\nOn June 18, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.66 per share paid on August 9, 2024 to holders of record\non July 9, 2024 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend was $611 million.\nOn September 16, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.66 per share payable on November 8, 2024 to\nholders of record on October 9, 2024 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend is\n$606 million.\n42 MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q\nPART I\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRepurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock. In December 2023 and 2022, our Board of Directors approved\nshare repurchase programs of our Class A common stock authorizing us to repurchase up to $11.0 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively. The\nprogram approved in 2023 became effective in May 2024 after the completion of the share repurchase program approved in 2022. The\ntiming and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including cash requirements to meet the\noperating needs of the business, legal requirements, as well as the share price and economic and market conditions. The following table\nsummarizes our share repurchase authorizations and repurchase activity of our Class A common stock through September 30, 2024:\n(in millions, except\naverage price data)\nRemaining authorization at December 31, 2023 $ 14,142\nDollar-value of shares repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 1 $ 7,565\nRemaining authorization at September 30, 2024 $ 6,578\nShares repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 16.5\nAverage price paid per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 $ 458.36\nNote: Table may not sum due to rounding.\n1 The dollar-value of shares repurchased does not include a 1% excise tax. The incremental tax is recorded in treasury stock on the consolidated balance\nsheet.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the potential impact of these pronouncements refer to Note 1\n(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1.\nItem 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\nMarket risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in factors\nsuch as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates\nand interest rates is limited. Management monitors risk exposures on an ongoing basis and establishes and oversees the implementation of\npolicies governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.\nForeign currency and interest rate exposures are managed through our risk management activities, which are discussed further in Note 17\n(Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage currency exposure associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements\noccurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. We may also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to\noffset possible changes in value of assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations. The objective of these activities is to reduce\nour exposure to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar\nand euro. The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the functional currencies could result in a fair value loss of\napproximately $529 million and $414 million on our foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity.\nWe are also subject to foreign exchange risk as part of our daily settlement activities. To manage this risk, we enter into short duration\nforeign exchange derivative contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective currency position. This risk is\ntypically limited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with our customers. A\nhypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the functional currencies would not have a material impact to the fair value of our short\nduration foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nWe are further exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to translation of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the\nfunctional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. To manage this risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative\ncontracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of\nthe U.S. dollar could result in a fair value loss of approximately $297 million on our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as a\nnet investment hedge at September 30, 2024, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we did not have any foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as a net investment hedge.\nMASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q 43\nPART I\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur available-for-sale debt investments include fixed and variable rate securities that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our policy is\nto invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. A\nhypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair value of our investments\nat September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nWe are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate debt. To manage this risk, we may enter into interest rate derivative\ncontracts to hedge a portion of our fixed-rate debt that is exposed to changes in fair value attributable to changes in a benchmark interest\nrate. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately $23\nmillion and $29 million on the fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts designated as a fair value hedge of our fixed-rate debt at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity.\nItem 4. Controls and procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”)) are designed to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed in the reports under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The President and Chief\nExecutive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report and, based on their evaluation, have concluded\nthat the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Mastercard's internal control over financial reporting.\n44 MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q\nPART II\nItem 1.

The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and\nresults of operations of the Company.\nOctober 31, 2024\n/s/ Sachin Mehra\nSachin Mehra\nChief Financial Officer\nEXHIBIT 99.1\nSection 13(r) Disclosure\nMastercard Incorporated (\"Mastercard\") has established a risk-based compliance program designed to prevent us from having\nbusiness dealings with Iran, as well as other prohibited countries, regions, individuals or entities. This includes obligating\nissuers and acquirers to screen account holders and merchants, respectively, against the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets\nControl’s (“OFAC”) sanctions lists, including the List of Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN list”).\nWe identified through our compliance program that for the period covered by this Report, an acquirer located in the Europe\nregion acquired transactions over our network for an Iranian airline.\nOFAC regulations and other legal authorities provide exemptions for certain activities involving dealings with Iran. However,\nSection 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 requires us to disclose whether we, or any of our\naffiliates, have knowingly engaged in certain transactions or dealings involving the Government of Iran or with certain persons\nor entities found on the SDN list, regardless of whether these dealings constitute a violation of OFAC regulations.\nWe do not calculate net revenues or net profits associated with specific merchants (our customers’ customers). However, we\nused our fee schedule and the aggregate number and amount of transactions involving the above merchants to estimate the\nnet revenue and net profit we obtained with respect to the period covered by this Report. Both the number of transactions\nand our estimated net revenue and net profits for this period are de minimis."

We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants,\ngovernments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those\npayment transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of\npayment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®.\nWe operate a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers.\nThrough our unique and proprietary core global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions.\nWe have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time\naccount-based payments). Using these capabilities, we offer payment products and services and capture new payment flows. Our\nvalue-added services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions designed to allow all parties to transact securely, easily\nand with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on our principled and responsible use of\nsecure consumer and merchant data. Our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity\ncapabilities, support and strengthen our payments and services solutions. Each of our capabilities support and build upon each\nother and are fundamentally interdependent. For our core global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and\nground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. We employ a multi-\nlayered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.\nFor a full discussion of our business, please see page 10.\nOur Performance\nThe following are our key financial and operational highlights for 2023, including growth rates over the prior year:\nGAAP\nNet revenue Net income Diluted EPS\n$25.1B $11.2B $11.83\nup 13% up 13% up 16%\nNon-GAAP 1 (currency-neutral)\nAdjusted net revenue Adjusted net income Adjusted diluted EPS\n$25.1B $11.6B $12.26\nup 13% up 12% up 15%\n$11.2B $9.0B Repurchased shares $12.0B\nin capital returned cash flows\n$2.2B Dividends paid\nto stockholders from operations\nGross dollar volume Cross-border volume growth\nSwitched transactions\n(growth on a local currency basis) (on a local currency basis)\n$9.0T up 24% 143.2B\nup 12% up 14%\n1 Non-GAAP results (including growth rates) exclude the impact of gains and losses on equity investments, Special Items and/or foreign currency.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Results Overview” in Part II, Item 7 for\nthe reconciliation to the most direct comparable GAAP financial measures.\n6 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1.

We are executing on this strategy through a focus\non three key priorities:\n• expand in payments for consumers, businesses and governments\n• extend our services to enhance transactions and drive customer value\n• embrace new network opportunities to enable open banking, digital identity and other adjacent network capabilities\nEach of our priorities supports and builds upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent.\nOur strategy Our key priorities Powering our success\nGrow People Brand\nour core\nDiversify Data Technology\ninto new customers\nand geographies\nBuild Franchise Doing well by\nnew areas doing good\nfor the future\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 7\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOur Key Strategic Priorities\nExpand in payments. We focus on expanding upon our core payments network to enable payment flows for consumers, businesses,\ngovernments and others, which provides them with choice and flexibility to transact across multiple payment rails (including cards,\nreal-time payments, account-based transactions, crypto and others), while ensuring that all payments are safe, secure and seamless.\nWe do so by:\n• Driving growth in consumer payments with a focus on accelerating digitization, growing acceptance and pursuing an expanded\nset of use cases, including through partnerships\n• Capturing new payment flows by expanding our multi-rail capabilities and applications to penetrate key flows such as\ncommercial point-of-sale transactions, business-to-business (“B2B”) accounts payable flows, disbursements and remittances and\nconsumer bill payments\n• Leaning into new payment innovations including acceptance growth accelerators such as Tap on Phone, cloud commerce and\ncontactless, as well as developing solutions that support digital currencies and blockchain applications\nExtend our services. Our services drive value for our customers and the broader payments ecosystem. These services include cyber\nand intelligence solutions, insights and analytics, consulting, marketing, loyalty, processing and payment gateway solutions for e-\ncommerce merchants. As we drive value, our services generate revenue while helping to accelerate our overall financial\nperformance by supporting revenue growth in payments and new network opportunities. We extend our services by:\n• Enhancing the value of payments by making payments safe, secure, intelligent and seamless\n• Expanding services to new segments and use cases to address the needs of a larger set of customers, including financial\ninstitutions, merchants, governments, digital players and others, while expanding our geographic reach\n• Supporting and strengthening new network capabilities, including expanding services associated with digital identities and\ndeploying our expertise in open banking and open data\nEmbrace new network opportunities. We are building and managing new adjacent network capabilities to power commerce and\npayments, creating new opportunities to develop and embed services. We do so by:\n• Applying our open banking solutions to help institutions and individuals exchange consumer-permissioned data securely and\neasily by enabling the reliable access, transmission and management of consumer data (including for opening new accounts,\nsecuring loans, increasing credit scores and enabling consumer choice in money movement and personal finance management)\n• Enabling digital identity solutions to instill trust in the digital world and help ensure that payments across consumers,\nbusinesses, devices and virtual entities are efficient, safe and secure\nEach of our priorities supports and builds upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent:\n• Payments provide data and distribution to drive scale and differentiation in services and enable the development and adoption\nof new network capabilities\n• Services improve the security, efficiency and intelligence of payments, improve portfolio performance, differentiate our\nofferings, strengthen our customer relationships and support our open banking and digital identity networks\n• New network opportunities strengthen our digital payments value proposition, including improved authentication with digital\nidentity, and new opportunities to develop and embed services in our expanding product offerings\nPowering Our Success\nThese priorities are supported by six key drivers:\nPeople. Our success is driven by the skills, experience, integrity and mindset of our people. We attract, develop and retain top\ntalent from diverse backgrounds and industries, in alignment with our strategic priorities. Our winning culture is guided by the\nMastercard Way, which outlines the behaviors we expect from employees to deliver for our customers and one another. We foster\na working environment grounded in decency, respect, equity and inclusion, where people have opportunities to perform purpose-\ndriven work that impacts communities, customers and co-workers on a global scale.\nBrand. Our brands and brand identities serve as a differentiator for our business, representing our values and enabling us to\naccelerate growth in new areas.\n8 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nData. We create a range of products and services for our customers using our data assets, infrastructure, platforms and expertise\nwhile following our data and tech responsibility principles in how we design, implement and deliver those solutions. Our Privacy by\nDesign, Data by Design and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Governance processes are designed to ensure we embed multiple layers of\nprivacy, data protection and information security controls in all of our products and services, keeping a clear focus on protecting\ncustomers’ and individuals’ data and privacy.\nTechnology. Our technology provides resiliency, scalability and flexibility in how we serve customers. It enables broader reach to\nscale digital payment services to multiple channels. Our technology standards, services and governance model help us to serve as\nthe connection that allows financial institutions, financial technology companies (fintechs) and others to interoperate and enable\nconsumers, businesses, governments and merchants to engage through digital channels.\nFranchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders who participate in our global payments network. Our franchise model creates\nand sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We provide a balanced ecosystem where all\nparticipants benefit from the availability, innovation and safety and security of our network. Our franchise model enables the scale\nof our network and provides a single governance structure for its operation. This structure has the potential to be extended to new\nopportunities.\nDoing Well by Doing Good. Sustainable impact is fundamental to our business strategy. We leverage our employees, technology,\nresources, partnerships and expertise to address social, economic and environmental challenges, while at the same time creating\nmarkets for future growth and driving long-term value for stockholders. Our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) priorities\nare expressed through three pillars - People, Prosperity, Planet - and all of the work we do is grounded in strong governance\nprinciples. For more information, please reference our most recently published Environmental, Social and Governance Report and\nProxy Statement (each located on our website).\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 9\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOur Business\nOur Multi-Rail Network and Payments Capabilities\nWe enable a wide variety of payments capabilities (including products and value-added services and solutions) over our multi-rail\nnetwork among account holders, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, governments and others, offering our customers one\npartner for their payment needs.\nPayment Network\nOur core payment network links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account\nholders to use our products at over 100 million acceptance locations worldwide. This network facilitates an efficient, safe and secure\nmeans for making and receiving payments, a convenient, quick and secure payment method for consumers to access their funds and\na channel for businesses to receive insight through information that is derived from our network. We enable transactions for our\ncustomers through our core payment network in more than 150 currencies and in more than 210 countries and territories.\nPayment Network Transactions. Our core payment network supports what is often referred to as a “four-party” payments network\nand includes the following participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for\npayment), issuer (the account holder’s financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).\nWe do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by\nissuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products. In most cases,\naccount holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\nThe following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our core payment network and our role in that transaction, which includes\npayments ecosystem security, value-added services and the enablement of digital payments:\nIn a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After\nthe transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the\ninterchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder’s account. The\nacquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount” rate), to the merchant.\n• Interchange Fees. Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in\nbalancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers\nand paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing\nservices that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network\nenables increased sales to their existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new products, guaranteed\npayments and improved customer experience. We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish “default interchange fees”\nthat apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the\ncollection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.\n10 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n• Additional Four-Party System Fees. The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both\nparticipating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the\ninterchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and\nrelated fees in addition to the merchant discount rate. Issuers may also charge account holders fees for the transaction,\nincluding, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.\nSwitched Transactions\n• Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our core payment network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the\nissuer for its approval, facilitate the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a\nsuccessfully conducted transaction, and settle the transaction by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties via\nsettlement banks chosen by us and our customers.\n• Cross-Border and Domestic. Our core payment network switches transactions throughout the world when the merchant country\nand country of issuance are different (“cross-border transactions”), providing account holders with the ability to use, and\nmerchants to accept, our products and services across country borders. We also provide switched transaction services to\ncustomers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same (“domestic transactions”). We switch over\n65% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.\nWe guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core payment\nnetwork. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to\nmerchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.\nPayment Network Architecture. Our core payment network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our\nissuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture\nthat enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing\nand applying multiple value-added services (such as fraud scoring, tokenization services, etc.) to appropriate transactions in real\ntime. This architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the transaction is occurring. It has 24-hour a\nday availability and world-class response time.\nAccount-Based Payments Capabilities\nWe offer ACH batch and real-time account-based payments capabilities, enabling payments for ACH transactions between bank\naccounts in real-time. Our real-time account-based payments capabilities provide consumers and businesses the ability to make\ninstant (faster) payments while providing enhanced data and messaging capabilities. We build, implement, enhance and operate\nreal-time clearing and settlement infrastructure, payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we either operated or were implementing real-time payments infrastructure in 13 markets. We also use our\nreal-time account-based payments capabilities to enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive\nmoney directly from account to account.\nWe discuss below under “Our Payment Products and Applications” the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based\npayments capabilities to capture new payment flows.\nSecurity and Franchise\nPayments Ecosystem Security. We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem, including a\nrobust program designed to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms\nincorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and security protection. Our programs are assessed by third\nparties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate\ninformation security challenges, including maintaining an information security program, an enterprise resilience program and\ninsurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. We work with experts across the\norganization (as well as through other sources such as public-private partnerships) to monitor and respond quickly to a range of\ncyber and physical threats, including threats and incidents associated with the use of services provided by third-party providers.\nAs another feature of our multi-layered approach, we work with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments and payments industry\nassociations to develop and put in place technical standards (such as EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe and\nsecure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are designed to help provide safety and security for the global\npayments ecosystem. Our approach includes supporting small businesses by sharing best practices and providing access to free\nutilities and services, benefiting both them and the entire payments ecosystem. We discuss specific cyber and intelligence solutions\nthat we offer to our customers below under “Our Value-Added Services”.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 11\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOur Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our global payments network, setting standards and\nrules for all participants and aiming to ensure interoperability among them while balancing risk and value across all stakeholders.\nOur franchise model achieves this by creating and sustaining a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem.\nThrough our franchise model, we work to ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants may benefit from the availability,\ninnovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this goal through the following key activities:\n• Participant Onboarding. We determine that each new customer meets the necessary prerequisites to use and contribute to our\nnetwork by defining clear ecosystem roles and responsibilities for their operations\n• Operating Standards. We define the technical, operational and financial standards that all network participants are required to\nuphold\n• Safety and Security. We establish central principles, including safeguarding consumer protections and integrity, so participants\nfeel confident to transact on the network\n• Responsible Stewardship.

BUSINESS\nRevenue Sources\nMastercard is a payments network service provider that generates revenue from a wide range of payment solutions we provide to\nour customers. We classify our net revenues, which includes the impact of rebates and incentives, from contracts with customers\ninto two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions.\nWithin our payment network, revenue is primarily generated from charging fees to our customers based on GDV (which includes\nboth domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry our brands and for providing switching and other network-related\nservices.\nWithin our value-added services and solutions, we generate revenue primarily related to the following:\n• Cyber and intelligence solutions • Processing and gateway\n• Data and services solutions • Open banking solutions\n• ACH batch and real-time account-based domestic and cross- • Digital identity solutions\nborder payments and solutions\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenue” in Part II, Item 7 and Note 3,\nRevenue for more detail about our revenue.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one\nor more affiliates. We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by us to\nsupport our payment programs. Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used\nand/or properly maintained. Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks on a royalty-\nfree basis in connection with our customers’ issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we own a number of patents\nand patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, biometrics, AI,\nsecurity systems, blockchain and other technologies, which are important to our business operations. These patents expire at\nvarying times depending on the jurisdiction and filing date.\nCompetition\nWe face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry. We compete in all categories of\npayments (including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments) as well as in all categories in which we provide\nvalue-added services and solutions:\n• General Purpose Payments Networks. We compete worldwide with payments networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB,\nChina UnionPay and Discover, among others. These competitors tend to offer a range of card-based payment products. Some\ncompetitors have more market share than we do in certain jurisdictions. Some also have different business models that may\nprovide an advantage in pricing, regulatory compliance burdens or otherwise. Globally, financial institutions may issue both\nMastercard- and Visa-branded payment products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual portfolios or\nprograms. In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express-, China UnionPay- and/or Discover-branded payment\ncards in a manner consistent with a four-party system. We continue to face intense competitive pressure on the prices we\ncharge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives\nand other support to issue and promote our payment products.\n• Debit and Local Networks. We compete with ATM and point-of-sale debit networks. In various countries, local debit brands\nserve as the main domestic brands, while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions (typically representing\na small portion of overall transaction volume). In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting, local\nnetworks for domestic switching. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to\npayments system regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively.\n• Real-time Account-based Payments Systems. We face competition in the ACH and real-time account-based payments space\nfrom providers of infrastructure, applications and services. As these real-time account-based propositions mature, we face a\npossible increase in competition for our existing domestic person-to-merchant (“P2M”) and person-to-person (“P2P”) transaction\nmarket share. Similarly, as interlinking of these infrastructures is further explored, they could disrupt our existing cross-border\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 21\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nP2M and P2P market share. Also, several industry initiatives are experimenting with the concept of account-based global\nschemes, which could lead to a disruption of the clearing and settlement options utilized in various currencies.\n• Digital Wallets and other Fintechs. As the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition\nfrom fintechs and other emerging payments providers, both for customers and data. Many of these providers, who in many\ncircumstances can also be our partners or customers, have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-\ncommerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels), and may process payments using in-house account\ntransfers, real-time account-based payments networks or global or local networks, in addition to card. Examples include digital\nwallet providers, point-of-sale financing/buy-now-pay-later providers, mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money\ntransfer and microfinancing services, handset manufacturers, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable providers.\n• Government-Backed Networks. Governments have been increasingly creating and expanding local payments structures (such as\nthe Brazilian Instant Payment System-PIX, FedNow in the U.S. and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), which are\nincreasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours. In particular,\nIndia has recently engaged in a series of efforts to expand the interoperability and cross-border reach of UPI globally. Most\nrecently, it announced an agreement in 2023 to partner with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to enable Indian travelers within\nthe UAE to pay with UPI. In addition to local and regional networks, national governments continue to explore the use of central\nbank digital currencies (“CBDCs”).\n• Digital Currencies. Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they become more regulated and\nincreasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 24/7 accessibility, immutability and efficiency. Some players, including payment\nservice providers and payment facilitators, have started to enable merchant acceptance of such currencies in P2M, while some\nbanks have started experimenting with blockchain B2B payments. Digital currencies and emerging players (such as crypto\nnatives) have the ability to disrupt traditional financial markets. The increased prominence of digital currencies creates an\nopportunity for us but could equally compete with our products and services.\n• Value-Added Service Providers and New Network Capabilities Players. We face competition from companies that provide\nalternatives to our value-added services and solutions. These companies include information services and consulting firms that\nprovide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, merchants and governments, technology companies that\nprovide cyber and fraud solutions (including AI-based solutions), and companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty\nand program management solutions. We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our open banking\nand digital identity solutions. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.\n22 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1.

In particular, we are subject to the laws and regulations that affect the payments industry in the many\ncountries in which our products and services are used. We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations and\nimplementing policies, procedures and programs designed to promote compliance.

Some governments have taken action to provide resources, preferential treatment\nor other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own national providers. For\nexample, governments in some countries mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only\ndomestic companies. Some jurisdictions are currently considering adopting or have adopted “data localization” requirements, which\nmandate the collection, storage, and/or other processing of data within their borders. This is the case, for instance, in India, China\nand Saudi Arabia. Various forms of data localization requirements or data transfer restrictions are also under consideration in other\ncountries and jurisdictions, including the EU.\n24 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nAnti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption. We are subject to anti-\nmoney laundering (“AML”) and countering the financing of terrorism (“CFT”) laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Bank\nSecrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic sanctions programs, including those imposed and\nadministered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). We have implemented a comprehensive AML/CFT program,\ncomprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, which is designed to\nprevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and\nregulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The economic sanctions programs\nadministered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies (specifically Crimea,\nthe Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria) and with\npersons and entities included in OFAC sanctions lists including its list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the\n“SDN List”). We take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC and other applicable sanctions, including\nestablishing a risk-based compliance program that has policies, procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having\nunlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or entities. As part of this program, we obligate issuers and\nacquirers to comply with their local sanctions obligations and U.S. and EU sanctions programs. In the U.S., these obligations include\nrequiring the screening of account holders and merchants, respectively, against OFAC sanctions lists (including the SDN List). Iran\nand Syria have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or\naffiliated entities located in these countries and do not license entities domiciled there. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws\nand regulations globally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which, among other things,\ngenerally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or\nto gain an unfair business advantage. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls to proactively manage\ncorruption risk.\nIssuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation. Our issuers and acquirers are subject to numerous regulations and\ninvestigations applicable to banks, financial institutions and other licensed entities, impacting us as a consequence. Additionally,\nregulations such as the revised Payment Services Directive (commonly referred to as “PSD2”) in the EEA require financial institutions\nto provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transactions away from\nMastercard products and provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers who use our products.\nPSD2 also requires a new standard for authentication of transactions, which necessitates additional verification information from\nconsumers to complete transactions. This may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to\nensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\nRegulation of Internet, Digital Transactions and High-Risk Merchant Categories. Various jurisdictions have enacted or have\nproposed regulation related to internet transactions which applies to payments system participants, including us and our customers.\nWe may also be impacted by evolving laws surrounding gambling, including fantasy sports, as well as certain legally permissible but\nhigh-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco.\nPrivacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business are subject to increasingly complex\nand fragmented privacy, data and information security laws and regulations in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world. For\nexample, in the U.S., we and our customers are respectively subject to, among other laws and regulations, Federal Trade\nCommission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) that\nrequire, among other things, the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and, increasingly, a\nnumber of state data and privacy laws. With respect to information security, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) adopted new disclosure rules that require, among other things, disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report\non Form 8-K, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material. In the EU, we are subject to the General\nData Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive\nprivacy, data protection and information security program to protect the personal and sensitive data of EEA residents. Several\nregulators and policymakers around the globe use the GDPR as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy, data protection and\ninformation security laws and regulations, although divergences have occurred. Laws and regulations in this area are constantly\nevolving due to several factors, including increasing data collection and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents,\nmore sensitive data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI. In addition, the interpretation and application of these\nprivacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations are often uncertain and in a state of flux, thus requiring\nconstant monitoring for compliance.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 25\nPART I\nITEM 1.

Various jurisdictions have adopted or are increasingly considering adopting laws and regulations impacting our reporting on\nESG governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets, and results. Regulations already adopted or being considered\ninclude required corporate reporting and disclosures on specific topics as well as broader ESG matters. Specific topics include\nclimate (such as the U.K. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting, the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, or “EU\nCSRD”, and the SEC proposed rules related to climate change) and human rights (such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due\nDiligence Directive). Broader ESG matters include other environmental matters, treatment of employees and diversity of workforce\n(such as in the EU CSRD).\nAdditional Regulatory Developments.

Similarly, jurisdictions that regulate a particular\nproduct may consider extending their jurisdiction to other products. For example, debit regulations could lead to regulation of credit\nproducts. Moreover, several jurisdictions are demonstrating increased interest about the network fees we charge to our customers\n(in some cases as part of broader market reviews of retail payments), which could in the future lead to regulation of our network\nfees. In several jurisdictions, we have been designated as a “systemically important payment system”, with other regulators\nconsidering similar designations. This type of regulation and oversight is related to switching activities (authorization, clearing and\nsettlement), and includes policies, procedures and requirements related to risk management, collateral, participant default, timely\nswitching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resources. Parts of our business have also been deemed as a “specified\nservice provider” or considered “critical infrastructure”. The impact to our business created by any new law, regulation or\ndesignation is magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in, or conflict with, other jurisdictions, or involve other products\nwithin any particular jurisdiction.\nThe expansion of our products and services as part of our multi-rail strategy has also created the need for us to obtain new types and\nincreasing numbers of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional compliance burdens distinct from those\nimposed on our core payment network activities. For example, certain of our subsidiaries maintain money transfer licenses to\nsupport certain activities. These licenses typically impose supervisory and examination requirements, as well as capital,\nsafeguarding, risk management and other business obligations.\nIncreased regulation and oversight of payments systems, as well as increased exposure to regulation resulting from changes to our\nproducts and services, have resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise\nincrease our costs. As a result, customers could be less willing to participate in our payments system and/or use our other products\nor services, reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products (making our products less desirable to\nconsumers), reduce the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions or other operational metrics, disintermediate us, impact\nour profitability and/or limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services, all of which could materially and\nadversely impact our financial performance. In addition, any regulation that is enacted related to the type and level of network fees\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 27\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nwe charge our customers could also materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Regulators could also require us to\nobtain prior approval for changes to our system rules, procedures or operations, or could require customization with regard to such\nchanges, which could negatively impact us. Moreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could\nresult in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and\nresults of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.\nIncreased regulatory, legislative and litigation activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness.\nInterchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of products\nassociated with our core payment network. Although we do not earn revenues from interchange, interchange rates can impact the\nvolume of transactions we see on our payment products. If interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting our\nproducts or route transactions away from our network. If interchange rates are too low, issuers may stop promoting our products\nand services, eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free checking or low interest rates\non balances), or charge fees to account holders (e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).\nGovernments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through\nlegislation, regulation and litigation. See “Business - Government Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory\nProceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details.\nIf issuers cannot collect or we are required to reduce interchange rates, issuers may be less willing to participate in our four-party\npayments system. Alternatively, they may reduce the benefits associated with our products, choose to charge higher fees to\nconsumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services, or seek a fee reduction from us to decrease the\nexpense of their payment programs (particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in\nterms of the fees we can charge). These and other impacts could make our products less desirable to consumers, limit our ability to\ninnovate or offer differentiated products, and/or make proprietary three-party networks or other forms of payment more attractive,\nultimately reducing the volume of transactions over our network and our profitability.\nWe are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings, litigation and\nlegislative activity. The potential outcome of any of these activities could have a more positive or negative impact on us relative to\nour competitors. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates, any resulting legislation,\nregulation and/or litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations. In addition,\nregulatory proceedings and litigation could result (and in some cases has resulted) in us being fined and/or having to pay civil\ndamages, the amount of which could be material.\nLimitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe have historically implemented policies, referred to as no-surcharge rules, in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Canada,\nthat prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using our products instead of other means. Authorities\nin several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these no-surcharge rules (or indicated interest in doing so).\nAdditionally, our no-surcharge rules now permit U.S. and Canadian merchants to surcharge credit cards (subject to certain\nlimitations), which over time could lead merchants in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions to choose to surcharge\nas permitted. This could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably and/or using alternative means of payment instead\nof electronic products, which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes, and which in turn could materially and\nadversely impact our results of operations.\nPreferential or Protective Government Actions\nPreferential and protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to\nmaintain or increase our revenues.\nGovernments in some countries have acted, or in the future may act, to provide resources, preferential treatment or other\nprotection to selected national payment and switching providers, or have created, or may in the future create, their own national\nprovider. This action may displace us from, prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular\ngeographies, and may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers. For example:\n• Governments in some countries have implemented, or may implement, regulatory requirements that mandate switching of\ndomestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies.\n• Some jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, requirements to collect, store and/or process data within their\nborders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications as well as\nincreased compliance burdens and other costs.\n28 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n• Geopolitical events (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) and resulting OFAC sanctions, adverse trade policies, enforcement of\nU.S. laws related to countering the financing of terrorism, economic sanctions and anti-corruption, or other types of government\nactions could lead affected or other jurisdictions to take actions in response that could adversely affect our business. Moreover,\ngiven our decision to suspend business operations in Russia, other separate jurisdictions may decide to begin to or increase their\nfocus on growing local payment networks and other solutions.\n• Regional groups of countries are considering, or may consider, efforts to restrict our switching of regional transactions.\n• Governments have been increasingly creating and expanding local payments structures (such as the Brazilian Instant Payment\nSystem-PIX, FedNow in the U.S. and UPI in India), which are increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic\npayment solutions and schemes such as ours.\nSuch developments prevent us from utilizing our global switching capabilities for domestic or regional customers. In addition, to the\nextent a jurisdiction determines us not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements (including those related to data\nlocalization), we have been, and may again in the future be, subject to resource and time pressures in order to come back into\ncompliance. Our inability to effect change in, or work with, these jurisdictions could adversely affect our ability to maintain or\nincrease our revenues and extend our global brand.\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions have implemented, or may implement, foreign ownership restrictions, which could potentially have\nthe effect of forcing or inducing the transfer of our technology and proprietary information as a condition of access to their markets.\nSuch restrictions could adversely impact our ability to compete in these markets.\nPrivacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security\nRegulation and enforcement of privacy, data, AI, information security and the digital economy could increase our costs and lead\nto legal claims and fines, as well as negatively impact our growth and reputation.\nWe are subject to increasingly complex, fragmented and divergent laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection, data\nuse and governance, AI and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business. While policymakers around the globe\nlook to the EU and the GDPR when adopting new or updated privacy and data protection laws, divergences have occurred and\ncontinue to occur. As a result, new or updated privacy and data protection and information security laws and regulations have led,\nand may continue to lead, to similar, stricter or at times conflicting requirements, creating an uncertain regulatory environment. For\nexample, some jurisdictions have implemented or are otherwise considering requirements to collect, store and/or process data\nwithin their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications.\nOther jurisdictions have adopted or are otherwise considering adopting sector-specific regulations for the payments industry and\nother industries in which we participate, including forced data sharing requirements or additional verification requirements. In\naddition, laws and regulations on AI, data governance and credit decisioning may overlap or conflict with, or diverge from, general\nprivacy rules. Overall, these myriad laws and regulations may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, incur\nsubstantial compliance-related costs and expenses, and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business. Failure to comply with\nany of these laws, regulations and requirements could result in fines, sanctions or other enforcement actions or penalties, which\ncould materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business, as well as have an impact on our reputation.\nAs a user and deployer of AI technology, we are also subject to increasing and evolving laws and regulations related to AI governance\nand new applications of existing laws and regulations to AI. How our use and deployment of AI will be regulated remains uncertain\ngiven the uncertainty that exists as to how AI technology will develop. In addition, the use of AI creates or amplifies risks that are\nchallenging to fully prevent or mitigate. In particular, AI algorithms may generate inaccurate, unintended, unfair or discriminatory\noutcomes, which may not be easily detectable or explainable, and may inadvertently breach intellectual property, privacy or other\nrights, as well as confidential information. Our implementation of robust AI governance and risk management frameworks aimed at\ncomplying with emerging laws and regulations may not be sufficient protection against these emerging risks.\nFurther, as we acquire new companies and develop integrated and personalized products and services to meet the needs of a\nchanging marketplace, we have expanded our data profile through additional data types and sources, across multiple channels, and\ninvolving new partners. This expansion has amplified the impact of these various laws and regulations on our business. As a result,\nwe are required to constantly monitor our data practices and potentially change them when necessary or appropriate. We also need\nto provide increased care in our data management, governance and quality practices, particularly as it relates to the use of data in\nproducts leveraging AI.\nNew requirements or changing interpretations of existing requirements in these areas, or the development of new regulatory\nschemes related to the digital economy in general, may also increase our costs and/or restrict our ability to leverage data or use AI\nfor innovation. This could impact the products and services we offer and other aspects of our business, such as fraud monitoring,\nthe need for improved data management, governance and quality practices, the development of information-based products and\nsolutions, and technology operations. In addition, these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 29\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nproducts or using information products, which may, in turn, decrease the number of our products that they offer. While we intend\nto comply with all regulatory requirements, innovate responsibly and deploy Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance\napproaches to all of our product development, the speed and pace of changes in laws (as well as stakeholder interests) may not\nallow us to meet rapidly evolving regulatory and stakeholder expectations. Any of these developments could materially and\nadversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nOther Regulation\nRegulations that directly or indirectly apply to Mastercard as a result of our participation in the global payments industry may\nmaterially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our products and services are\nused. Many of our customers are also subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions that, at times,\nconsequently affect us. Such regulation has increased significantly in the last several years (as described in “Business - Government\nRegulation” in Part I, Item 1). Examples include:\n• Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption - We are subject to\nAML and CFT laws and regulations globally. Economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions\nand other dealings with certain countries and geographies, and persons and entities. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws\nand regulations globally, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the\npurpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage.\n• Account-based Payments Systems - In the U.K., aspects of our Vocalink business are subject to the U.K. payment system\noversight regime and are directly overseen by the Bank of England.\n• Issuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation - Certain regulations (such as PSD2 in the EEA) may impact various\naspects of our business. For example, PSD2’s strong authentication requirement could increase the number of transactions that\nconsumers abandon if we are unable to secure a frictionless authentication experience under these standards. An increase in\nthe rate of abandoned transactions could adversely impact our volumes or other operational metrics.\nIncreased regulatory focus on us has resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or\notherwise increase our costs. Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the\nvolume of transactions processed through our systems, or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our products. Actions by\nregulators could influence other organizations around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measures, amplifying any\npotential compliance burden. Additionally, our compliance with new economic sanctions and related laws with respect to particular\njurisdictions or customers could result in a loss of business, which could be significant. Moreover, while our risk-based compliance\nprogram obligates issuers and acquirers to comply with U.S., EU and local sanctions programs (among other obligations), the failure\nof those issuers and acquirers to identify potential non-compliance issues either during or after their customer onboarding processes\ncould ultimately impact our compliance with economic sanctions and related laws. Finally, failure to comply with the laws and\nregulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties. In particular, a violation and\nsubsequent judgment or settlement against us, or those with whom we may be associated, under economic sanctions and AML, CFT,\nand anti-corruption laws could subject us to substantial monetary penalties, damages, and/or have a significant reputational impact.\nEach instance may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance and/or our overall business\nand results of operations, as well as have an impact on our reputation.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nCurrent and potential future changes in existing tax laws, including regulatory guidance, are continuously being considered and have\nbeen or may be enacted (such as guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which\nimpact how multinational enterprises are taxed on their global profits). These changes have and in the future may continue to have\nan impact on our effective income tax rate and tax payments. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our\ncustomers and counterparties, or the economy generally, have impacted and may continue to impact us as well.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with\napplicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Jurisdictions\naround the globe have also increased tax-related audits, which require time and resources to resolve.\nAny changes in enacted tax laws, rules, regulatory or judicial interpretations or guidance; any adverse outcome in connection with\ntax audits in any jurisdiction; or any changes in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and\nadversely impact our effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\n30 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nLitigation\nLiabilities we may incur or limitations on our business related to any litigation or litigation settlements could materially and\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are a defendant in a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations, including among others, those\nalleging violations of competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property claims (as described in Note 21 (Legal\nand Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8). In the event we are found liable in\nany material litigations or proceedings (particularly in a large class-action lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the\nplaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable), we could be subject to significant damages, which\ncould have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nCertain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation and litigation settlements, such as changes\nto our no-surcharge rule in the U.S. and Canada. Any future limitations on our business resulting from the outcomes of any litigation\nor regulatory proceeding, including any changes to our rules or business practices, could impact our relationships with our\ncustomers, including reducing the volume of business that we do with them, which may materially and adversely affect our overall\nbusiness and results of operations.\nBusiness and Operations\nCompetition and Technology\nSubstantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall\nbusiness and results of operations.\nThe global payments industry is highly competitive. Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside of\nthe global payments industry and compete in all payment categories, including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic\npayments. We compete against general purpose payments networks, debit and local networks, ACH and real-time account-based\npayments systems, digital wallets and other fintechs (focused on online activity across various channels and processing payments\nusing in-house capabilities), government-backed networks and digital currencies. We also face competition from companies that\nprovide alternatives to our value-added services and new adjacent network capabilities (including open banking and digital identity).\nOur traditional competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of\nprograms, services, and payment capabilities than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to\nachieve broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we have. They may also introduce their own innovative\nprograms, value-added services and capabilities that adversely impact our growth.\nCertain of our competitors to our core payment network operate three-party payments systems with direct connections to both\nmerchants and consumers, potentially providing competitive advantages. If we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than\nthese competitors because we operate a four-party system, or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which\nour competitors are not, we could lose business to these competitors. See “Business - Competition” in Part I, Item 1.\nCertain of our competitors have developed alternative payments systems, e-commerce payments systems and payments systems for\nmobile devices, as well as physical store locations. A number of these competitors rely principally on technology to support their\nservices that provides cost advantages, and as a result may enjoy lower costs than we do. Many of these competitors are also able\nto use existing payment networks without being subject to many of the associated costs. Moreover, these competitors also occupy\nvarious roles in the payments ecosystem that enable them to influence payment choice of other participants. Any of these factors\ncould put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation,\ncompetition-related regulatory proceedings and both central bank and legislative activity.\nIf we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively align our\nresources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats. Our failure to compete\neffectively against any of the foregoing threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 31\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nDisintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.\nAs the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, including:\n• Parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment\nprocess. For example, merchants could switch (and in some cases are switching) transactions directly with issuers. Additionally,\nprocessors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Large scale consolidation within processors could\nresult in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some cases switching the entire transaction on their own\nnetwork, thereby disintermediating us.\n• Industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account-based payments, which could\nfacilitate P2M transactions that compete with both our core payment network and our additional payment capabilities.\n• Regulation (such as PSD2 in the EEA) may disintermediate issuers by enabling third-party providers opportunities to route\npayment transactions away from our network and products and towards other forms of payment by offering account\ninformation or payment initiation services directly to those who currently use our products. Such regulation may also provide\nthese processors with the opportunity to commoditize the data that are included in the transactions they are servicing. If our\ncustomers are disintermediated in their business, we could face diminished demand for our products and services.\n• Although we partner with fintechs and technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that leverage our\ntechnology, platforms and networks to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us\nfrom digital payments and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy. These companies may also develop products or\nservices that compete with our customers within the payments ecosystem and, as a result, could diminish demand for our\nproducts and services. When we do partner with fintechs and technology companies, we face a heightened risk when we share\ndata as part of those relationships. While we share this data in a controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and\nprivacy and data standards, sharing this data without proper oversight could provide partners with a competitive advantage.\n• Competitors, customers, fintechs, technology companies, governments and other industry participants may develop products\nthat compete with or replace products and services we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payments\nofferings. These products could either replace, or force us to change our pricing or practices, for these offerings. In addition,\ngovernments that develop or encourage the creation of national or international payments platforms may promote their\nplatforms in such a way that could put us at a competitive disadvantage in those markets, or require us to compete differently.\n• Participants in the payments industry may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may\nstrengthen their existing business services or create new payment products and services that compete with our products and\nservices.\nOur failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall\nbusiness and results of operations.\nContinued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nIn order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our products and services, we seek to enter into business\nagreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support that promote our products. In\norder to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts so as to meet customer\ndemand for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives, which moderates our growth. Our inability to switch\nadditional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower\nfees or increased costs in the future could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. In addition,\nincreased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those\nrelating to customer incentives.\nIn the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling\nto offer, and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the\nindustry. Some of our competitors are larger with greater financial resources and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to\nour customers. In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further\nincrease transaction volumes or the amount of services provided in order to benefit from such agreements and to increase revenue\nand profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. Our customers also may\nimplement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives\nor greater cost stability. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we face pricing pressure related to real-time account-based payment schemes and cross-border payments (including\nthe increased use of domestic real-time account-based payment schemes offering increasingly lower or subsidized pricing for P2M\ntransactions as well as continued downward pressure on pricing for cross-border payments resulting from competition from real-\ntime account-based payment schemes and from initiatives to lower the cost of cross-border payments to end users (such as the G20\n32 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRoadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments)). These factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and\nresults of operations.\nRapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of\noperations or limit our future growth.\nThe payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact our business in several ways:\n• Technological changes (including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices, contactless\nand mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and blockchain, AI, machine learning, privacy enhancement and\ncybersecurity) could result in new technologies that may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in\nour programs and services. Moreover, these changes could result in new and innovative payment methods, products and\nservices that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our products and services.\n• We rely in part on third parties (including some of our competitors and potential competitors) for the development of and access\nto new technologies. The inability of these companies to keep pace with technological developments, or the acquisition of these\ncompanies by competitors, could negatively impact our offerings.\n• Our ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards (such\nas those related to EMV, tokenization or other safety and security technologies), and by resistance from customers or merchants\nto such changes.\n• Our ability to develop evolving systems and products may be inhibited by any difficulty we may experience in attracting and\nretaining employees with technology expertise.\n• Our ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties. We have received,\nand we may in the future receive, notices or inquiries from patent holders (including operating companies or non-practicing\nentities) suggesting that we may be infringing patents or that we need to license the use of their patents to avoid infringement.\nSuch notices may, among other things, threaten litigation against us or our customers or demand significant license fees.\n• Our ability to develop new technologies and reflect technological changes in our payments offerings requires resources, which\nhas resulted in and may further result in additional expenses.\n• We work with fintechs, technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) and traditional customers that use\nour technology to enhance payment safety and security and to deliver their payment-related products and services quickly and\nefficiently to consumers. Our inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customers to\nwork with us, and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete against us.\n• Regulatory or government requirements have and could continue to require us to host and deliver certain products and services\non-soil in certain markets, requiring us to alter our technology and delivery model, potentially resulting in additional expenses.\n• Various central banks are experimenting with CBDCs which may be launched with their own networks to transfer money\nbetween participants. Policy and design considerations that governments adopt could impact the extent of our role in facilitating\nCBDC-based payment transactions, potentially impacting the transactions that we may process over our network.\nWe cannot predict the effect of future technological changes on our business, and our future success will depend, in part, on our\nability to anticipate, develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. Failure to keep pace with these\ntechnological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in the use\nof our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nOperating a real-time account-based payments network presents risks that could materially affect our business.\nU.K. regulators have designated Vocalink, our real-time account-based payments network platform, to be a “specified service\nprovider” and regulators in other countries may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real-time account-based payments\nsystems in similar ways. In addition, any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impacts,\nincluding potential intervention by the Bank of England and significant reputational risk to Vocalink and us. For a discussion of the\nregulatory risks related to our real-time account-based payments platform and oversight by regulators, see our risk factor in “Risk\nFactors - Payments Industry Regulation” in this Part I, Item 1A. Furthermore, the complexity of this payment technology requires\ncareful management to address information security vulnerabilities that are different from those faced on our core payment\nnetwork. Operational difficulties, such as the temporary unavailability of our services or products, or information security breaches\non our real-time account-based payments network could cause a loss of business for these products and services, result in potential\nliability for us and adversely affect our reputation.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 33\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWorking with new customers and end users as we expand our multi-rail solutions and products and services can present\noperational and onboarding challenges, be costly and result in reputational damage if the new products or services do not\nperform as intended.\nThe payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving\nindustry standards and changing customer and consumer needs. In order to remain competitive and meet the needs of the\npayments markets, we are continually involved in developing and implementing complex multi-rail solutions and diversifying our\nproducts and services. These efforts carry the risks associated with any diversification initiative, including cost overruns, delays in\ndelivery and performance problems. These projects also carry risks associated with working with different types of customers (such\nas corporations that are not financial institutions, non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”) and new end users). These differences\nmay present new operational challenges, such as enhanced infrastructure and monitoring for less regulated customers.\nOur failure to effectively design and deliver these multi-rail solutions and products and services could make our other offerings less\ndesirable to these customers, or put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, if there is a delay in the implementation of our\nproducts or services (which could include compliance obligations, such as AML and CFT, and licensing requirements for our products\nand services that operate under regulatory licenses), if our products or services do not perform as anticipated, or we are unable to\notherwise adequately anticipate risks related to new types of customers, we could face additional regulatory scrutiny, fines,\nsanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as\nnegatively impact our brand and reputation.\nInformation Security and Operational Resilience\nInformation security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, increase\nour costs and cause losses.\nInformation security risks for payments and technology companies such as ours have significantly increased in recent years in part\nbecause of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial\ntransactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, “hacktivists”, terrorists, nation-states, state-\nsponsored actors and other external parties. These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third\nparties, or may result from human error, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failure or other technological\nfailure. These threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, malicious code (including\nransomware), social-engineering attacks (including phishing attacks) or information security breaches and could lead to the\nmisappropriation or loss of consumer account and other information and identity theft. These types of threats have risen\nsignificantly due to a significant portion of our workforce working in a hybrid environment. These threats also may be further\nenhanced in frequency or effectiveness through threat actors’ use of AI.\nOur operations rely on the secure transmission, storage and other processing of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal\ninformation and technology in our computer systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers. Our\ncustomers and other parties in the payments value chain, as well as account holders, rely on our digital technologies, computer\nsystems, software and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers and\naccount holders increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control. We,\nlike other financial technology organizations, routinely are subject to cyber-threats and our technologies, systems and networks, as\nwell as the systems of our third-party providers, have been subject to attempted cyber-attacks. Because of our position in the\npayments value chain, we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks. Geopolitical events and\nresulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected or sympathizing jurisdictions or\nother actors, which could put our information and assets at risk, as well as result in network disruption.\nTo date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. However,\nfuture attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems (including third-party provider systems) or\ndevices that our customers use to access our products and services, which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure,\nrelease, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal information (including\naccount data information) or data security compromises. Such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions,\nmalfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure, networks or operations systems that support our business and\ncustomers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added services), as well as the operations of our customers or other third\nparties. In addition, they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers, other stakeholders and the broader payments\necosystem, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs),\nregulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business\nopportunities. These consequences could be further pronounced in jurisdictions in which we are deemed critical national\ninfrastructure. If such attacks are not detected immediately, or disclosed as required by law, their effect could be compounded.\n34 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to information security risks for our systems and networks, we also routinely encounter account data compromise events\ninvolving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment transaction data, which affect\nmillions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of account holders. Further events of this type may subject\nus to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands. Damage to our reputation or that of our\nbrands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems and networks or the systems and networks of our customers,\nmerchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products and services. Such events could also slow\nor reverse the trend toward electronic payments. In addition to reputational concerns, the cumulative impact of multiple account\ndata compromise events could increase the impact of the fraud resulting from such events by, among other things, making it more\ndifficult to identify consumers. Moreover, while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct\nclaims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could still face damage claims, which, if upheld,\ncould materially and adversely affect our results of operations. While we offer cyber and intelligence products that are designed to\nprevent, detect and respond to fraud and cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that such security solutions will perform as\nexpected or address all possible security threats. Real or perceived defects, failures, errors or vulnerabilities in our security\nsolutions, such as our cyber and intelligence products, could adversely impact our reputation, customer confidence in our solutions\nand our business and may subject us to litigation, governmental audits and investigation or other liabilities. Such events could have\na material adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs\nby leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us.\nIn addition, fraudulent activity and increasing cyber-attacks have encouraged legislative and regulatory intervention, and could\ndamage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services or increase our compliance costs. Criminals\nare using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture consumer personal information to engage in illegal activities such as\ncounterfeiting or other fraud and may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of AI. As outsourcing and specialization become\ncommon in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our payment products.\nWhile we are continuing to take measures to make card and digital payments more secure, increased fraud levels involving our\nproducts and services, or misconduct or negligence by third parties switching or otherwise servicing our products and services, could\nlead to legislative or regulatory intervention, such as enhanced security requirements and liabilities, as well as damage to our\nreputation. See “Risk Factors - Privacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security Compliance” in this Part I, Item 1A for more\ndetail concerning related legal risks and obligations.\nDespite various mitigation efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material breaches and\nresulting losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage, such coverage may not be adequate to protect us from such\nlosses as well as any liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of our confidential, proprietary, sensitive or\npersonal information or our technologies, systems or networks. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage\nwill continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Our risk\nand exposure to these matters remain heightened due to, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent\nrole in the global payments ecosystem, our continued implementation of our strategic priorities, our extensive use of third-party\nvendors and potential vulnerabilities from previous and future acquisitions, strategic investments or related opportunities. As a\nresult, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to\nprotect our computer systems, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us.\nAs cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or\nenhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described\nabove could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nService disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could reduce our operational\nresilience and materially affect our overall business and results of operations.\nOur transaction switching systems and other offerings have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience\ninterruptions as a result of technology malfunctions, supply-chain attacks, fire, floods, earthquakes, weather events, power outages,\ntelecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events (including those related to\nclimate change). Our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists, activists, or\nhackers who intend to disrupt our facilities, networks and/or systems. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the\ntimely transmission of information across our global data network. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also\nresult in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those markets. If one of our service providers fails to\nprovide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism,\nhacking or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Although we maintain an enterprise resiliency program to\nanalyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be\nimmune to these risks, because of the intrinsic importance of our switching systems to our business, any interruption or degradation\ncould adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall\nbusiness and our results of operations.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 35\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nStakeholder Relationships\nLosing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in\nthe longer term, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.\nMany of our customer relationships are not exclusive. Our customers can reassess their future commitments to us subject to the\nterms of our contracts, and they separately may develop their own services that compete with ours. Our business agreements with\nthese customers may not ultimately reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with\nus in favor of relationships with our competitors, or for other reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. Loss of business from any of our\nlarge customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nExclusive/near exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness.\nWhile we have exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with certain of our customers to issue payment products, other\ncustomers have similar exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These relationships may make it difficult\nor cost-prohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with these customers to increase our revenues. In addition, these\ncustomers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our payment products, which could\nput us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearly-exclusive relationships\nwith our competitors. Such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors\nwith which they are principally aligned. A significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business.\nConsolidation amongst our customers could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\nOur customers’ industries have undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation in the past. These consolidations have included\ncustomers with a substantial Mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor.\nPotential future consolidation could occur as a result of bank failures, similar to those that occurred in the U.S. during 2023. If\nsignificant consolidation among customers were to continue, it could result in the substantial loss of business for us, which could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business and prospects. In addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with,\nor acquire, one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business.\nConsolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers, which could increase their bargaining power and lead to\nlower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers. These developments could materially and adversely affect our results\nof operations.\nOur business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and, in\nmany jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.\nWhile we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system (including merchants, governments, fintechs and large\ndigital companies and other technology companies), we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships\nwith our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and\nservices. Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the\nmarket. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other\nfees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition,\nwe do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring\ncustomers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring\ncustomers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over\nwhich we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by\ncompetitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or\nwe may be exposed to settlement risk. See “Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations” in this Part I, Item 1A with\nrespect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations.\nWith the exception of the U.S. and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions\nconducted using cards with our brands are switched by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic\nswitching services in these countries or have direct relationships with account holders, we depend on our close working relationships\nwith our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these\ncountries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these\ncountries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to\nbe in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.\n36 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nMerchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our\nincentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nMerchants are important constituents in our payments system. We rely on both our relationships with them, as well as their\nrelationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our products and services. We also\nwork with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase\nrevenues and fight fraud. In the retail industry, we believe a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence are\nhaving a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have\nsupported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard has been defending, including the U.S.\nmerchant litigations. Some merchants are increasingly asking regulators to review and potentially regulate our own network fees, in\naddition to interchange. See “Risk Factors – Payments Industry Regulation” in this Part I, Item 1A. The continued focus of merchants\non the costs of accepting various forms of payment (including digital) may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nCertain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer\ncustomers as a condition to accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create co-\nbranded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of\nincentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive\nand regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of\nmerchant acceptance growth slows, our business could suffer.\nOur work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of\noperations.\nAs we increase our work with national, state and local governments, both indirectly through financial institutions and with them\ndirectly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments. These risks\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n• Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Changes in governmental priorities or other political\ndevelopments, including disruptions in governmental operations, could impact approved funding and result in changes in the\nscope, or lead to the termination, of the arrangements or contracts we or financial institutions enter into with respect to our\npayment products and services.\n• Our work with governments is heavily regulated, subjecting us to additional potential exposure under U.S. and international anti-\ncorruption laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), as well as compliance with various\nprocurement and other laws, regulations, standards and contract terms. Any violation and subsequent judgment or settlement\nrelated to the above could subject us to substantial monetary penalties and damages and have a significant reputational impact.\nMoreover, as a government contractor, we are subject to a government’s right to conduct audits and investigations into both our\ncontract performance and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Any adverse finding could\nsubject us to civil or criminal penalties, sanctions, or suspension or disbarment.\n• Working or contracting with governments, either directly or via our financial institution customers, can subject us to heightened\nreputational risks, including extensive scrutiny and publicity, as well as a potential association with the policies of a government\nas a result of a business arrangement with that government. Any negative publicity or negative association with a government\nentity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.\nGlobal Economic and Political Environment\nGlobal economic, political, financial and societal events or conditions could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall\nbusiness and results of operations.\nAdverse economic trends. Adverse economic trends in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial\nperformance. Such impact may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n• Customers mitigating their economic exposure by limiting the issuance of new Mastercard products and requesting greater\nincentive or greater cost stability from us\n• Consumers and businesses lowering spending, which could impact domestic and cross-border spend\n• Debt limit and budgetary discussions in the U.S. has affected, and could further affect, the U.S. credit rating, impacting consumer\nconfidence and spending\n• Government intervention (including the effect of laws, regulations and/or government investments on or in our financial\ninstitution customers), as well as uncertainty due to changing political regimes in executive, legislative and/or judicial branches of\ngovernment, that may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter\ntheir strategic direction away from our products\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 37\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n• Tightening of credit availability that could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of\nour credit facility\nCross-border transactions. We switch substantially all cross-border transactions using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded\ncards and generate a significant amount of revenue from cross-border volume fees and fees related to switched transactions.\nRevenue from switching cross-border and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and\ndestinations of cross-border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. Cross-border\nactivity has, and may continue to be, adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic, health, weather and other conditions.\nThese include or have included:\n• the global COVID-19 pandemic (and the potential of any post-pandemic global economic impact) and potential separate\noutbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases (any of which could result in future epidemics or pandemics)\n• current and potential future geopolitical conflicts, as well as expansion into regional or global conflicts, and the resulting impacts\nto our business (this includes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the actions taken by the U.S., the EU, other governments and\nMastercard in response)\n• the threat of terrorism and major environmental and extreme weather events (including those related to climate change)\nThe impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these events or factors could ultimately decrease cross-border activity.\nAdditionally, any regulation of interregional interchange fees could also negatively impact our cross-border activity (for example, the\ntargets announced by the G20 Financial Stability Board related to cross-border payments). In each case, decreased cross-border\nactivity could decrease the revenue we receive.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the cross-border impacts described above, our compliance with sanctions and our\ndecision to suspend our business operations in Russia has led, and could further lead, to other legal ramifications and operational\nchallenges, including fines, the nationalization of our subsidiary and any resulting impacts, and/or lawsuits.\nStandards. Our operations as a global payments network rely in part on global interoperable standards to help facilitate safe and\nsimple payments. To the extent geopolitical events result in jurisdictions no longer participating in the creation or adoption of these\nstandards, or the creation of competing standards, the products and services we offer could be negatively impacted.\nFactors such as those discussed above have adversely impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition, and any\nof these developments potentially could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations.\nDuring 2023, approximately 70% of our revenue was generated from activities outside the U.S. This revenue (and the related\nexpense) could be transacted in a non-functional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the\nentity generating the revenues. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income. Our risk management activities\nprovide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates\nof exposures to these currencies.\nIn addition, some of the revenue we generate outside the U.S. is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluation\nof currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthens compared to\ncurrencies in which we generate revenue, this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected. Furthermore,\nwe may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion into U.S. dollars of our other\nrevenue currencies and financial assets.\nThe occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nBrand, Reputational Impact and ESG\nNegative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business.\nOur brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain\nthem depends upon the external perception of us and our industry:\n• Our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers, merchants or other organizations that impact the perception of\nour brands or the payments industry in general. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be\nin the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory”. Moreover, adverse\ndevelopments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers or other companies and organizations that use our\nproducts and services (including certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms,\nalcohol and tobacco) may also, by association, impair our reputation, or result in greater public, regulatory or legislative scrutiny,\n38 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nas well as potential litigation. We may also face similar scrutiny to the extent that we are unable to detect and/or prevent illegal\nactivities using our payment products or otherwise occurring over our network.\n• We have been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace. Under some circumstances, our use of\nsocial media, or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes, could also cause rapid, widespread\nreputational harm to our brands by disseminating rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us, our\nproducts or merchants or other end users who utilize our products.\n• We are headquartered in the U.S. As such, a negative perception of the U.S. could impact the perception of our company, which\ncould adversely affect our business.\nAny of the above issues could have a material and adverse effect on our overall business.\nLack of visibility of our brand in our products and services, or in the products and services of our partners who use our technology,\nmay materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs more players enter the global payments ecosystem, the layers between our brand and consumers and merchants increase. In\norder to compete with other powerful consumer brands that are also becoming part of the consumer payment experience, we often\npartner with those brands on payment solutions. These brands include large digital companies and other technology companies\nwho are our customers and use our networks to build their own acceptance brands. In some cases, our brand may not be featured\nin the payment solution or may be secondary to other brands. Additionally, as part of our relationships with some issuers, our\npayment brand is only included on the back of the card. As a result, our brand may either be invisible to consumers or may not be\nthe primary brand with which consumers associate the payment experience. This brand invisibility, or any consumer confusion as to\nour role in the consumer payment experience, could decrease the value of our brand, which could adversely affect our business.\nESG matters and related stakeholder reaction may impact our reputation, expose us to legal requirements and liability and/or\nhave other business impacts, which could adversely affect our overall business and/or results of operations.\nOur brand and reputation are associated with our public commitments to various ESG initiatives, including our goals relating to\nclimate (such as our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040), financial inclusion, and DEI. Consumers, investors,\nemployees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG practices. To the extent any of our ESG disclosures, public\nstatements and metrics are subsequently viewed as inaccurate, or we are unable to execute on our ESG initiatives, we may be\nviewed negatively by stakeholders concerned about these matters. Stakeholders (including those in support of or in opposition to\nESG principles) may also have a negative view of us to the extent we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to their ESG\nconcerns or take positions that are contrary to their views or expectations.\nIn addition, various jurisdictions are increasingly adopting or considering laws and regulations that have or would impact us\npertaining to ESG governance, strategy, risk management and metrics/targets/results. These include required corporate reporting\nand disclosures on specific topics (such as climate and human rights) as well as broader matters (such as other environmental\nmatters, treatment of employees and diversity of workforce). These requirements have, and are likely to continue to, result in\nincreased compliance costs for our business and supply chain, which may increase our operating costs.\nMoreover, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressure to address climate change and other ESG matters, these\nstakeholders may express new expectations and focus investments in ways that could cause significant shifts in commerce and\nconsumption behaviors. The impact of and uncertainty that could result from such shifts could ultimately impact our business.\nAny of the above issues could have a material or adverse impact to our overall business and/or results of operations.\nTalent and Culture\nWe may not be able to attract and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, or maintain our corporate culture, which could\nharm our overall business and results of operations.\nOur performance largely depends on the skills, capabilities and motivation of our employees (including our people leaders), as well\nas the environment we create for them to enable them to perform their jobs effectively. While attrition and pace of hiring has\nslowed due to economic uncertainty, the market for specialized skill-sets remains highly competitive, particularly in technology and\nother areas that are important to the growth of our business. To the extent we are unable to differentiate our value proposition in\nthe market, effectively develop leaders and build robust succession pipelines, it could impact our ability to deliver for our customers.\nTo the extent we cannot design our processes and practices to support equitable outcomes, our ability to attract talent may be\nsignificantly impacted and we may experience talent attrition. In addition, escalations in global conflict and a rise in mental health\nneeds are also impacting the well-being of our people. To the extent we are unable to communicate effectively on these issues and\nprovide support to our employees, we could experience a significant impact on our business, reputation and culture. Further,\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 39\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nchanges in and enforcement of immigration and work permit laws and visa regulations have made it difficult for employees to work\nin, or transfer among, jurisdictions where we operate, potentially impairing our ability to attract and retain talent.\nOur flexibility policies and programs (in particular, those related to work arrangements) may impact the well-being and productivity\nof our workforce, which in turn could have a negative impact on the quality of our corporate culture and our ability to innovate. To\nthe extent these policies (including our team-based agreements) do not meet candidate or employee expectations for flexibility, this\ncould also impact our ability to attract and retain talent.\nFailure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent could leave us vulnerable to not\nanticipating or identifying emerging customer or market opportunities. We also rely on our people leaders to display integrity and\ndecency. To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that is not consistent with our values, we could experience significant impact\nto our brand and reputation, as well as to our corporate culture.\nAny one or more of the above could harm our overall business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions and Strategic Investments\nOur efforts to enter into acquisitions, strategic investments or new businesses could be impacted or prevented by regulatory\nscrutiny and could otherwise result in issues that could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation.\nWe continue to evaluate our strategic acquisitions of, and investments in, complementary businesses, products or technologies. As\nwe do so, we face increasing regulatory scrutiny with respect to antitrust, national security and other considerations that could\nimpact these efforts. We also face competition for acquisition targets due to the nature of the market for technology companies. As\na result, we could be prevented from successfully completing such acquisitions in the future. If we are not successful in these\nefforts, we could lose strategic opportunities that are dependent, in part, on inorganic growth.\nTo the extent we do make these acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them, despite original\nintentions and focused efforts. Such an integration also may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and\ndisrupt our operations. Moreover, we have spent, and may continue to spend, time and money on acquisitions or projects that do\nnot sufficiently meet our expectations (either strategically or financially), which has resulted (and may in the future result) in\ndivesting from or otherwise exiting these investments or businesses. Additionally, to the extent we pay the purchase price of any\nacquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with\nour stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, we have inherited and may in the future inherit litigation risk which\nhas or may increase our post-acquisition costs of operations and/or impact our ability to successfully finance that business.\nAny acquisition, investment or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations, both directly as a result of the new\nbusiness as well as in the other existing parts of our business, with which we would need to comply. This compliance could increase\nour costs, and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements.\nAdditionally, targets that we acquire have had, and may in the future have, data practices that do not initially conform to our\nprivacy, data protection and information security standards and data governance model, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and\nreputational harm. These targets also have resulted in, and may in the future lead to, information security vulnerabilities for us.\nSettlement and Third-Party Obligations\nOur role as guarantor, as well as other contractual obligations and discretionary actions, expose us to risk of loss or illiquidity.\nWe are a guarantor of certain third-party obligations, including those of certain of our customers and service providers. In this\ncapacity, we are exposed to credit and liquidity risk. We may incur significant losses in connection with transaction settlements if a\ncustomer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems, liquidity shortfalls, insolvency or other reasons. The\nrecent increased speed of bank failures as recently seen in the U.S. could increase the potential for such losses. Concurrent\nsettlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several smaller customers either on a given day or over a\ncondensed period of time may exceed our available resources. Additionally, certain non-guaranteed transactions as well as\nchargebacks to acquirers in the event of acquirer default could result in elevated brand risk and the potential for financial loss.\nThese impacts could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have significant contractual indemnification obligations with certain customers. Should an event occur that triggers these\nobligations, such an event could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n40 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nClass A Common Stock and Governance Structure\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover provisions and have an impact\non change-in-control.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could be considered\nanti-takeover provisions, including provisions that could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders\nconsider favorable. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely\na change in control, which could harm our stock price. For example, subject to limited exceptions, our amended and restated\ncertificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15% of any of the Class A common stock or any\nother class or series of our stock with general voting power, or more than 15% of our total voting power. In addition:\n• our stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors\n• our stockholders are not entitled to act by written consent\n• any representative of a competitor of Mastercard or of Mastercard Foundation is disqualified from service on our board of\ndirectors\nMastercard Foundation’s substantial stock ownership, and restrictions on its sales, may impact corporate actions or acquisition\nproposals favorable to, or favored by, the other public stockholders.\nAs of February 8, 2024, Mastercard Foundation owned 97,543,508 shares of Class A common stock, representing approximately\n10.5% of our general voting power. Historically, Mastercard Foundation had been restricted from selling or otherwise transferring\nits shares of Class A common stock prior to May 1, 2027, except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement\nrequirements, for which purpose earlier sales were permitted and had occurred. In July 2023, pursuant to an application in\nconsultation with Mastercard, Mastercard Foundation received court approval to advance that date to January 1, 2024. As a result,\nMastercard Foundation is now permitted to sell all or part of its remaining shares, subject to certain conditions. Mastercard\nFoundation would do so pursuant to an orderly and structured plan to diversify its Mastercard shares over a seven-year period,\nwhile remaining a long-term Mastercard stockholder and retaining a significant holding of Mastercard shares in its portfolio. The\ndirectors of Mastercard Foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers. The ownership of Class A common\nstock by Mastercard Foundation, together with the seven-year diversification plan, could discourage or make more difficult\nacquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the Class A common stock. In addition, because Mastercard Foundation\nintends to sell its shares over an extended period of time, it may not have the same interest in short or medium-term movements in\nour stock price as, or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to, our other stockholders.\nItem 1B.

Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity program\nAs a technology company in the global payments industry entrusted with the safeguarding of sensitive information (including\npersonal information), cybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management program. A\nrobust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats is critical to managing risk effectively. Our\nnetwork and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and security protection. Our programs\nare assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in\nmany efforts to mitigate information security challenges, including maintaining an information security program, an enterprise\nresilience program and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. We work\nwith experts across the organization (as well as through other sources such as public-private partnerships) to monitor and respond\nquickly to a range of cyber and physical threats, including threats and incidents associated with the use of services provided by third-\nparty providers. Our cybersecurity program provides (among other things) a framework for handling cybersecurity threats and\nincidents, which includes steps for identifying the nature of a cybersecurity threat (including whether the threat is associated with a\nthird-party provider), assessing the severity of a cybersecurity threat (including advancing to key members of management where\nappropriate for determination of potential materiality) and implementing cybersecurity processes and procedures.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 41\nPART I\nITEM 1C.

These executives include:\n• Chief Security Officer (CSO), who develops and oversees the programs, policies and controls we have implemented across the\norganization to reduce and prevent logical and physical risks, including information security and cyber risks to our people,\nintellectual property, data and tangible property\n• Chief Privacy and Data Responsibility Officer, who establishes and oversees the programs, policies, processes and controls we\nhave implemented across the organization to ensure compliance with worldwide laws and regulations regarding how we collect,\nuse, share, store, transfer and otherwise process data and leverage AI, while also managing our relevant engagements with\nregulators, policymakers and key stakeholders\n• Chief Data Officer, who oversees our efforts to maintain an ethical, responsible enterprise data program that adheres to our high\nstandards for data quality, curation and governance while minimizing data risks\n• Data Protection Officer, who reports to the Chief Privacy and Data Responsibility Officer and ensures that we continue to adhere\nto the GDPR and local privacy requirements, including by handling privacy requests from individuals and regulators\nIn order to be appointed to one of the roles described above, we require expertise with cybersecurity or data privacy (as applicable),\nas demonstrated by prior work or other cybersecurity or data privacy experience or possession of a cybersecurity or data privacy\ndegree or certification. The individuals currently serving in these roles each meet the applicable expertise requirements.\n42 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nHow management is informed of and monitors incidents\nOur management is responsible for identifying, considering and assessing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis,\nestablishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risks are monitored, implementing appropriate mitigation\nmeasures and maintaining our cybersecurity programs. Our cybersecurity programs are under the direction of our CSO (in\ncoordination with our Chief Privacy and Data Responsibility Officer, Chief Data Officer, among others), who receives reports from our\ncybersecurity teams and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Our\nmanagement, including the CSO and our cybersecurity teams, follow a risk-based escalation process to notify the Risk Committee\noutside of the regular reporting cycle as appropriate when they identify an emerging risk or material issue.\nReporting to our Board\nGiven the importance of information security and privacy to our stakeholders, our Board receives an annual report from our CSO to\ndiscuss our program for managing information security risks, including cyber and data security risks. The Risk Committee also\nreceives periodic briefings on data privacy from the Chief Privacy and Data Responsibility Officer. Our Risk Committee receives\nregular reports on our cyber readiness, our risk profile status, our cybersecurity programs, material cybersecurity risks and\nmitigation strategies, third-party assessments of our cybersecurity program and other cybersecurity developments. The Risk\nCommittee chair provides reports to the Board on such topics. In addition, our Board and the Risk Committee also receive\ninformation about these topics as part of regular business and legal and regulatory updates. In addition, we engage directors as part\nof cybersecurity and data breach incident simulations.\nDespite our efforts to identify and respond to cybersecurity threats, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or\nprovide assurances that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident. See “Risk Factors – Information Security\nand Operational Resilience” in Part I, Item 1A for more information about these and other risks related to information security.\nItem 2.

We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants,\ngovernments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those\npayment transactions safe, simple, smart, and accessible. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of\npayment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®.\nWe operate a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers.\nThrough our unique and proprietary core global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions.\nWe have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time\naccount-based payments). Using these capabilities, we offer payment products and services and capture new payment flows. Our\nvalue-added services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions designed to allow all parties to transact securely, easily\nand with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on our principled and responsible use of\nsecure consumer and merchant data. Our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity\ncapabilities, support and strengthen our payments and services solutions. Each of our capabilities support and build upon each\nother and are fundamentally interdependent. For our core global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and\nground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. We employ a multi-\nlayered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.\nMastercard is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or\nother fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’\nacceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\nFinancial Results Overview\nThe following table provides a summary of our key GAAP operating results, as reported:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n2023 2022 2021\nIncrease/ Increase/\n(in millions, except per share data) (Decrease) (Decrease)\nNet revenue $ 25,098 $ 22,237 $ 18,884 13% 18%\nOperating expenses $ 11,090 $ 9,973 $ 8,802 11% 13%\nOperating income $ 14,008 $ 12,264 $ 10,082 14% 22%\nOperating margin 55.8 % 55.2 % 53.4 % 0.7 ppt 1.8 ppt\nIncome tax expense $ 2,444 $ 1,802 $ 1,620 36% 11%\nEffective income tax rate 17.9 % 15.4 % 15.7 % 2.6 ppt (0.4) ppt\nNet income $ 11,195 $ 9,930 $ 8,687 13% 14%\nDiluted earnings per share $ 11.83 $ 10.22 $ 8.76 16% 17%\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding 946 971 992 (3)% (2)%\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 49\nPART II\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nNon-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts\nso as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our\nequity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition and\nthe related tax impacts. Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which\nrepresent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts (“Special Items”). We\nalso present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the non-\nGAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison\nof our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in\nrelation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based\ncompensation. We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the\nCompany separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. Net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other\nincome (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses\non our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\n• During 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded net pre-tax losses of $61 million ($36 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share), net\npre-tax losses of $145 million ($126 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share) and net pre-tax gains of $645 million\n($497 million after tax, or $0.50 per diluted share), respectively. These net gains and losses were primarily related to unrealized\nfair market value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities. In addition, in 2021, net gains also included\nrealized gains on sales of marketable equity securities.\nSpecial Items\nLitigation provisions\n• During 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $539 million ($376 million after tax, or $0.40 per diluted share) related to litigation\nprovisions, which included pre-tax charges of:\n◦ $344 million as a result of changes in the estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant\nclass litigation, and\n◦ $195 million as a result of settlements with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\n• During 2022, we recorded pre-tax charges of $356 million ($263 million after tax, or $0.27 per diluted share) related to litigation\nprovisions, which included pre-tax charges of:\n◦ $223 million as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants, and\n◦ $133 million as a result of a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class\nlitigation.\n• During 2021, we recorded pre-tax charges of $94 million ($74 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to litigation\nsettlements and estimated attorneys’ fees with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\nRussia-related impacts\n• During 2022, we recorded a net pre-tax charge of $30 million ($24 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share), directly related to\nimposed sanctions and the suspension of our business operations in Russia. The net charge was comprised of general and\nadministrative expenses of $67 million, primarily related to incremental employee-related costs and reserves on uncollectible\nbalances with certain sanctioned customers. This charge was offset by net benefits of $37 million in net revenue, primarily\nrelated to a reduction in payment network rebates and incentives liabilities as a result of lower estimates of customer\nperformance for certain customer business agreements due to the suspension of our business operations in Russia.\nIndirect tax matter\n• During 2021, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $88 million ($69 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) to resolve a foreign\nindirect tax matter for 2015 through 2021 and the related interest expense. The charge was comprised of general and\nadministrative expenses of $82 million and other income (expense) of $6 million.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 51\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSee Note 7 (Investments) and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part\nII, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion related to certain of our non-GAAP financial measures.\nCurrency-neutral Growth Rates\nCurrency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for\nboth the translational and transactional impacts on operating results and are non-GAAP financial measures. The impact of currency\ntranslation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar\nreporting currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in\na currency other than the functional currency of the entity. The impact of the related realized gains and losses resulting from our\nforeign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments is recognized in the respective financial\nstatement line item on the statement of operations when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings. We believe the\npresentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to facilitate an understanding of our operating results.\nThe translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivative contracts\ndesignated as cash flow hedging instruments (“Currency impact”) has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates and has\nbeen identified in the non-GAAP information below and our “Drivers of Change” tables. See “Foreign Currency - Currency Impact”\nfor further information on our currency impacts and “Financial Results - Net Revenue” and “Financial Results - Operating Expenses”\nfor our “Drivers of Change” tables.\nThe following tables reconcile our reported financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to the respective adjusted non-\nGAAP financial measures:\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nOther Effective Diluted\nNet Operating Operating income income Net earnings\nrevenue expenses margin (expense) tax rate income per share\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReported - GAAP $ 25,098 $ 11,090 55.8 % $ (369) 17.9 % $ 11,195 $ 11.83\n(Gains) losses on equity investments ** ** ** 61 0.1 % 36 0.04\nLitigation provisions ** (539) 2.1 % ** 0.5 % 376 0.40\nAdjusted - Non-GAAP $ 25,098 $ 10,551 58.0 % $ (308) 18.5 % $ 11,607 $ 12.26\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nOther Effective Diluted\nNet Operating Operating income income Net earnings\nrevenue expenses margin (expense) tax rate income per share\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReported - GAAP $ 22,237 $ 9,973 55.2 % $ (532) 15.4 % $ 9,930 $ 10.22\n(Gains) losses on equity investments ** ** ** 145 — % 126 0.13\nLitigation provisions ** (356) 1.6 % ** 0.3 % 263 0.27\nRussia-related impacts (37) (67) 0.2 % ** — % 24 0.02\nAdjusted - Non-GAAP $ 22,200 $ 9,549 57.0 % $ (387) 15.7 % $ 10,342 $ 10.65\nYear ended December 31, 2021\nOther Effective Diluted\nNet Operating Operating income income Net earnings\nrevenue expenses margin (expense) tax rate income per share\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReported - GAAP $ 18,884 $ 8,802 53.4 % $ 225 15.7 % $ 8,687 8.76\n(Gains) losses on equity investments ** ** ** (645) (0.5) % (497) (0.50)\nLitigation provisions ** (94) 0.5 % ** 0.1 % 74 0.07\nIndirect tax matter ** (82) 0.4 % 6 0.1 % 69 0.07\nAdjusted - Non-GAAP $ 18,884 $ 8,627 54.3 % $ (413) 15.4 % $ 8,333 $ 8.40\nNote: Tables may not sum due to rounding.\n** Not applicable\n52 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

We\nbelieve that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a\nmeaningful comparison of our results between periods.\nOperating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income\n(expense) and income tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\nKey Drivers\nGross Dollar Volume (“GDV”)1 measures dollar volume of activity, including both domestic and cross-border volume, on cards\ncarrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume\nplus cash volume; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the\nrelevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance\ntransfers and convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. Information denominated in\nU.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in\nwhich our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each\nquarter. We report period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency\ninformation, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of\nchange.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 53\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCross-border Volume Growth2 measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and\nU.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.\nSwitched Transactions2 measures the number of transactions switched by Mastercard, which is defined as the number of\ntransactions initiated and switched through our network during the period.\n1 Data used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking\nagainst information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or\nMastercard’s customers. Starting in the first quarter of 2022, data related to sanctioned Russian banks was not reported to us and therefore\nsuch amounts are not included. Subsequent to the suspension of our business operations in Russia in March 2022, there is no Russian data to be\nreported.\n2 Growth rates are normalized to eliminate the effects of differing switching and carryover days between periods, as needed. Carryover days are\nthose where transactions and volumes from days where the Company does not clear and settle are processed.\nThe following tables provide a summary of the growth trends in our key drivers.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nUSD Local USD Local\nMastercard-branded GDV growth 1 10% 12% 6% 12%\nUnited States 6% 6% 10% 10%\nWorldwide less United States 13% 15% 4% 13%\nCross-border volume growth 1 25% 24% 33% 45%\nMastercard-branded GDV growth adjusted for Russia 1,2 11% 12% 10% 18%\nWorldwide less United States GDV growth adjusted for Russia 1,2 13% 15% 11% 22%\nCross-border volume growth adjusted for Russia 1,2 25% 25% 37% 50%\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nSwitched transactions growth 14% 12%\nSwitched transactions growth adjusted for Russia 2 16% 21%\n1 Excludes volume generated by Maestro and Cirrus cards.\n2 Starting in the first quarter of 2022, as a result of imposed sanctions and the suspension of our business operations in Russia, we have provided\nadjusted growth rates for our key drivers excluding activity from Russian issued cards from the prior periods.\nKey Metrics related to the Payment Network\nAssessments represent agreed upon standard pricing provided to our customers based on various forms of payment-related activity.\nAssessments are used internally by management to monitor operating performance as it allows for comparability and provides\nvisibility into cardholder trends. Assessments do not represent our net revenue.\nThe following provides additional information on our key metrics related to the payment network:\n• Domestic assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that carry the Company’s brands where the merchant\ncountry and the country of issuance are the same. These assessments are primarily driven by the domestic dollar volume of\nactivity (e.g., domestic purchase volume, domestic cash volume) or the number of cards issued.\n• Cross-border assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that carry the Company’s brands where the merchant\ncountry and the country of issuance are different. These assessments are primarily driven by the cross-border dollar volume of\nactivity (e.g., cross-border purchase volume, cross-border cash volume).\n54 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n• Transaction processing assessments are charges primarily driven by the number of switched transactions on our payment\nnetwork. Switching activities include:\n◦ Authorization, the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval\n◦ Clearing, the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a\ntransaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction\n◦ Settlement, which facilitates the determination and exchange of funds between parties\nThese assessments can also include connectivity services and network access which are based on the volume of data transmitted\nand the number of authorization and settlement messages.\n• Other network assessments are primarily charges for licensing, implementation and other franchise fees.\nThe following table provides a summary of our key metrics related to the payment network.\nYear ended December 31, 2023 2022\nIncrease/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)\nCurrency- As Currency-\n2023 2022 2021 As reported neutral Reported neutral\n($ in millions)\nDomestic assessments $ 9,566 $ 8,794 $ 8,064 9% 9% 9% 12%\nCross-border assessments 8,409 6,597 4,646 27% 28% 42% 53%\nTransaction processing assessments 12,067 10,646 9,041 13% 13% 18% 23%\nOther network assessments 963 766 668 26% 26% 15% 14%\nForeign Currency\nCurrency Impact\nOur primary revenue functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and the Brazilian real. Our overall operating\nresults are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional\ncurrency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.\nOur operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of\nconverting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. Changes in currency\nexchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“GDV”), which are used in the calculation of our key metrics\nrelated to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives. GDV is\ncalculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars and euros using average exchange rates for the period.\nAs a result, our key metrics related to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates\nand incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar and euro versus local currencies. For example, our\nbilling in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar. The transactional currency\nimpact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. The\nstrengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV\ngrowth on a local currency basis. In 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.4%, while GDV on a local currency basis\nincreased 11.9% versus 2022. In 2022, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 5.9%, while GDV on a local currency basis\nincreased 12.3% versus 2021.

On both an as adjusted\nand currency-neutral basis, net revenue increased 13%. The increase in net revenue on both an as reported and as adjusted basis\nwas attributable to growth in our payment network and value-added services and solutions.\nNet revenue from our payment network increased 10%, on both an as reported and currency neutral basis, in 2023 versus 2022. The\nincrease was primarily driven by growth in domestic and cross-border dollar volumes and an increase in the number of switched\ntransactions, reflecting trends of growth in our key drivers. Net revenue from our payment network includes $15,182 million of\nrebates and incentives provided to customers, which increased 22% on both an as reported and currency-neutral basis, in 2023\nversus 2022, primarily due to an increase in our key drivers as well as new and renewed deals.\nNet revenue from our value-added services and solutions increased 18%, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2023 versus 2022.\nThe increase was driven primarily by the continued growth of (i) our cyber and intelligence solutions, driven by our underlying key\ndrivers and the scaling of our fraud and security solutions, as well as (ii) our consulting, marketing and loyalty solutions.\nSee Note 3 (Revenue) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for a further discussion of how we recognize\nrevenue.\n56 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

A significant\nportion of our net revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2023, the net revenue from these customers was\napproximately $5.6 billion, or 22%, of total net revenue. The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could\nadversely impact our revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased 11% in 2023 versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses increased 10%, or 11% on a currency-\nneutral basis, versus the prior year, which includes a 1 percentage point increase from acquisitions.

Adjusted other income (expense) decreased $79 million versus the prior\nyear, primarily due to an increase in our investment income, partially offset by increased interest expense related to our debt\nportfolio as well as losses on sales of certain assets.\nThe components of other income (expense) were as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022\n($ in millions)\nInvestment income $ 274 $ 61 $ 11 ** **\nGains (losses) on equity investments, net (61) (145) 645 ** **\nInterest expense (575) (471) (431) 22 % 9 %\nOther income (expense), net (7) 23 — ** **\nTotal other income (expense) (369) (532) 225 (31) % **\n(Gains) losses on equity investments 1 61 145 (645) ** **\nSpecial Items 1 — — 6 ** **\nAdjusted total other income (expense) 1 $ (308) $ (387) $ (413) (20) % (6) %\nNote: Table may not sum due to rounding.\n** Not meaningful\n1 See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” for further information on our non-GAAP adjustments and the reconciliation to GAAP reported amounts.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 17.9% and 15.4%, respectively. The adjusted\neffective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 18.5% and 15.7%, respectively. Both the as\nreported and as adjusted effective income tax rates were higher in 2023, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance\nassociated with the deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits. In 2022, we recognized a discrete tax benefit of $333\nmillion to release the valuation allowance resulting from U.S. tax regulations published in the first quarter of 2022 (the “2022\nRegulations”). In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the 2022 Regulations changed due to the foreign tax legislation\nenacted in Brazil and Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”), released by the U.S. Department of Treasury (“Treasury”). Therefore, we\nrecognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance. The discrete tax expense\nrecognized in 2023 was partially offset by our ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the\nNotice released by Treasury.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Pillar 2 guidelines published to date include transition and\nsafe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar 2 global minimum tax of 15%. Based on current enacted legislation\neffective in 2024 and our structure, we do not expect a material impact in 2024. We are monitoring developments and evaluating\nthe impacts these new rules will have on our future effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nSee Note 20 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 59\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and\nsettlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations.

This amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash\nequivalents of $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our\naccess to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding\ncommitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations which include\nlitigation provisions and credit and settlement exposure.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. We guarantee the settlement of\nmany of the transactions between our customers. Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant;\nhowever, historical trends may not be indicative of potential future losses. The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to\nindividual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic and market conditions, including, but not limited to the\nhealth of the financial institutions in a country or region. See Note 22 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated\nfinancial statements in Part II, Item 8 for a description of these guarantees.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to\nwhich we are a party. For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Legal\nand Regulatory Risks and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II,\nItem 8.\nCash Flow\nThe table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 11,980 $ 11,195 $ 9,463\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,351) (1,470) (5,272)\nNet cash used in financing activities (9,488) (10,328) (6,555)\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $0.8 billion in 2023 versus the prior year, primarily due to higher net income\nafter adjusting for non-cash items and an increase in restricted security deposits held for customers, partially offset by restricted\ncash paid for litigation settlement, higher employee incentives paid and higher customer incentives payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $0.1 billion in 2023 versus the prior year, primarily due to less cash paid for business\nacquisitions in the current year, partially offset by an increase in purchases of investments in time deposits.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $0.8 billion in 2023 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower debt payments and\nhigher proceeds from debt issuances in the current year, partially offset by higher repurchases of our Class A common stock and\nhigher dividend payments.\n60 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDebt and Credit Availability\nIn March 2023, we issued $750 million principal amount of notes due March 2028 and $750 million principal amount of notes due\nMarch 2033 (collectively the “2023 USD Notes”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 USD Notes, after deducting the\noriginal issue discount, underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $1.489 billion. In April 2023, we entered into an\nadditional unsecured INR4.97 billion ($61 million as of the date of settlement) term loan, originally due July 2023 (the “April 2023\nINR Term Loan”). In July 2023, we modified and combined the existing 2022 INR Term Loan and April 2023 INR Term Loan (the “2023\nINR Term Loan”), increasing the total unsecured loans to INR28.1 billion ($342 million as of the date of settlement). The 2023 INR\nTerm Loan is due July 2024.\nOur total debt outstanding was $15.7 billion at December 31, 2023, with the earliest maturity of $1.0 billion of principal occurring in\nApril 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), under which we are authorized\nto issue up to $8 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. In conjunction with the\nCommercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $8 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which now\nexpires in November 2028.\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to be used to provide liquidity for general corporate\npurposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers. In addition, we may borrow\nand repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. We had no borrowings outstanding under the\nCommercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at December 31, 2023.\nSee Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the\nCommercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nWe have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Subject to\nlegally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at\nthe sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating\nresults, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.\nThe following table summarizes the annual, per share dividends paid in the years reflected:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions, except per share data)\nCash dividend, per share $ 2.28 $ 1.96 $ 1.76\nCash dividends paid $ 2,158 $ 1,903 $ 1,741\nOn December 5, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.66 per share paid on February 9, 2024 to\nholders of record on January 9, 2024 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this\ndividend was $616 million.\nOn February 6, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.66 per share payable on May 9, 2024 to holders\nof record on April 9, 2024 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend is\nestimated to be $616 million.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 61\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRepurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock. In December 2023, December 2022 and November 2021,\nour Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs of our Class A common stock authorizing us to repurchase up to $11.0\nbillion, $9.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. The program approved in 2023 will become effective after the completion of the\nshare repurchase program approved in 2022. The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a\nvariety of factors, including cash requirements to meet the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, as well as the share\nprice and economic and market conditions. The following table summarizes our share repurchase authorizations and repurchase\nactivity of our Class A common stock through December 31, 2023:\n(in millions, except\nper share data)\nRemaining authorization at December 31, 2022 $ 12,174\nDollar-value of shares repurchased in 2023 1 $ 9,032\nRemaining authorization at December 31, 2023 $ 14,142\nShares repurchased in 2023 23.8\nAverage price paid per share in 2023 $ 379.49\n1 The dollar-value of shares repurchased does not include a 1% excise tax that became effective January 1, 2023. The incremental tax is recorded\nin treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheet and is payable annually beginning in 2024.\nSee Note 16 (Stockholders' Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect\nour reported financial condition. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nRevenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives\nWe enter into business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives when customers meet certain\nvolume thresholds or other incentives tied to customer performance. We consider various factors in estimating customer\nperformance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical\nexperience with that customer. Rebates and incentives are recorded within net revenue based on these estimates primarily when\nvolume- and transaction- based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Differences between actual results and our\nestimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. If our customers’ actual performance is not\nconsistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and\nassess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the\namount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the\ndetermination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of\nthe legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of\nuncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional\ninformation becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our\nestimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate,\nour judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.\nIncome Taxes\nIn calculating our effective income tax rate, estimates are required regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items\nwhich will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation of local tax regulations,\nadjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although we\nbelieve that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the\nestimated amounts.\n62 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we\nconsider all sources of taxable income, including projected future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences and\nongoing tax planning strategies. If it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value\nor to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a\ndetermination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.\nWe record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be\npartially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the\ntax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so,\nhow current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit\nwhich is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would generally increase earnings in the period. In certain situations,\nwe will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.\nDeferred taxes are established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or losses for foreign earnings that are not considered\npermanently reinvested, which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as incurred. Ultimately, the working\ncapital requirements of foreign affiliates will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective jurisdictions.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition purchase price, including\ncontingent consideration, if any, is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and intangible assets, liabilities assumed and any\nnon-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess of\npurchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The\namounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future\namortization expense. We use various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-\nfrom-royalty and multi-period excess earnings for estimating the value of intangible assets. These valuation techniques include\ncomparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions.\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the expected\nuseful lives, requires management’s judgment. The significance of management’s estimates and assumptions is relative to the size\nof the acquisition. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and\nunpredictable.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market\nrisk\nMarket risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in\nfactors such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and\nforeign exchange rates is limited. Management monitors risk exposures on an ongoing basis and establishes and oversees the\nimplementation of policies governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.\nForeign currency and interest rate exposures are managed through our risk management activities, which are discussed further in\nNote 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage currency exposure associated with anticipated receipts and\ndisbursements occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. We may also enter into foreign exchange\nderivative contracts to offset possible changes in value of assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations. The objective of\nthese activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our\nfunctional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the\nfunctional currencies could result in a fair value loss of approximately $414 million and $94 million on our foreign exchange\nderivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, before considering the offsetting effect of the\nunderlying hedged activity.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 63\nPART II\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are also subject to foreign exchange risk as part of our daily settlement activities. To manage this risk, we enter into short\nduration foreign exchange derivative contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective currency\nposition. This risk is typically limited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement\nwith our customers. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the functional currencies would not have a material impact\nto the fair value of our short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nWe are further exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to translation of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the\nfunctional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. To manage this risk, we may enter into foreign exchange\nderivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any\nforeign exchange derivative contracts designated as a net investment hedge. As of December 31, 2022, the effect of a hypothetical\n10% adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar could result in a fair value loss of approximately $203 million on our foreign\nexchange derivative contracts designated as a net investment hedge before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying\nhedged activity.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur available-for-sale debt investments include fixed and variable rate securities that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our\npolicy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant\nexposure. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair value of our\ninvestments at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWe are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate debt. To manage this risk, we may enter into interest rate\nderivative contracts to hedge a portion of our fixed-rate debt that is exposed to changes in fair value attributable to changes in a\nbenchmark interest rate. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material\nimpact to the fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts designated as a fair value hedge of our fixed-rate debt at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity.\n64 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nThe management of Mastercard Incorporated (“Mastercard”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, management has assessed the effectiveness of Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2023. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management has concluded that, based\non its assessment, Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. The effectiveness of\nMastercard’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the next page.\n66 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mastercard Incorporated\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Mastercard Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred\nto as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position\nof the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in\nthe period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAlso in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control\nover financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying Management’s Report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.\nOur audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 67\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides certain customers with rebates and\nincentives which are a portion of total net revenue of $25.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has\nbusiness agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives within net revenue that could be either fixed or\nvariable. Variable rebates and incentives are recorded primarily when volume- and transaction-based revenues are recognized over\nthe contractual term. Variable rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimated customer performance, such as volume\nthresholds, and the terms of the related business agreements. As disclosed by management, various factors are considered in\nestimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected\npayments and historical experience with that customer.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to rebates and incentives is a critical audit\nmatter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing estimates related to rebates and incentives based on\ncustomer performance; and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\nmanagement’s estimates related to customer performance, including the reasonableness of the various applicable factors\nconsidered by management in the estimate.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion\non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to rebates and\nincentives, including controls over evaluating estimated customer performance. These procedures also included, among others,\nevaluating the reasonableness of estimated customer performance for a sample of customer agreements, including (i) evaluating the\nagreements to identify whether all rebates and incentives are identified and recorded accurately; (ii) testing management’s process\nfor developing estimated customer performance, including evaluating the reasonableness of the various applicable factors\nconsidered by management; and (iii) evaluating estimated customer performance as compared to actual results in the period the\ncustomer reports actual performance.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 13, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1989.\n68 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nMastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard\nInternational” and together with Mastercard Incorporated, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), is a technology company in the global\npayments industry. Mastercard connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and\nother organizations worldwide by enabling electronic forms of payment and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart\nand accessible. The Company makes payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and\nservices through its family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. The Company operates\na multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and Mastercard customers. Through its\nunique and proprietary core global payments network, the Company switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions.\nThe Company has additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-\ntime account-based payments). Using these capabilities, the Company offers payment products and services and captures new\npayment flows. The Company’s value-added services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions designed to allow all\nparties to transact securely, easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on\nMastercard’s principled and responsible use of secure consumer and merchant data. The Company’s investments in new networks,\nsuch as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen payments and services solutions. Each of the\nCompany’s capabilities support and build upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent. For the core global payments\nnetwork, Mastercard’s franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and\nallows for interoperability among them. The Company employs a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments\necosystem in which it operates.\nMastercard is not a financial institution. The Company does not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from\ninterest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with\nmerchants’ acceptance of the Company’s products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the\nCompany’s financial institution customers.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation and basis of presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majority-\nowned and controlled entities, including any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.\nInvestments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as\nmarketable, equity method or measurement alternative method investments and recorded in other assets on the consolidated\nbalance sheet. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no significant VIEs which required consolidation and the investments\nwere not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates acquisitions as of the date on\nwhich the Company has obtained a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2023 presentation. The reclassifications had no\nimpact on previously reported total net revenue, operating income or net income. The Company follows accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the Company and are recorded for consolidated entities in\nwhich the Company owns less than 100% of the interests. Changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its\ncontrolling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and upon loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured\nat fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. For 2023, 2022 and 2021, net income/(losses) attributable to non-\ncontrolling interests were not material and, as a result, amounts are included on the consolidated statement of operations within\nother income (expense).\nUse of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Future events and their\neffects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. These financial\nstatements were prepared using information reasonably available as of December 31, 2023 and through the date of this Report. The\naccounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur,\nas more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes. Actual\nresults may differ from these estimates.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 75\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue recognition - Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nRevenue from the Company’s payment network is primarily generated by charging fees to customers (issuers, acquirers and other\nmarket participants) for providing switching and other network-related services, as well as by charging fees to customers based\nprimarily on the gross dollar volume of activity (GDV, which includes both domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry\nthe Company’s brands. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the related transactions and volume occur. Certain volume-\nbased revenue is determined from information reported by customers.\nRevenue from the Company’s value-added services and solutions is generated through either fixed or transaction-based fees. These\nservices and solutions can be integrated and sold with the Company’s payment network services or can be sold on a stand-alone\nbasis. Revenue from the Company’s value-added services and solutions is recognized in the period in which the related services and\nsolutions are performed or transactions occur. For services provided to customers where delivery involves the use of a third-party,\nthe Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis if it acts as the principal, controlling the service to the customer, or on a net basis\nif it acts as the agent, arranging for the service to be provided.\nMastercard has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives within net revenue that could\nbe either fixed or variable. Fixed incentives typically represent payments to a customer directly related to entering into an\nagreement, which are generally capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement on a straight-line basis. Variable rebates\nand incentives are recorded primarily when volume- and transaction-based revenues are recognized over the contractual term.\nVariable rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimated customer performance, such as volume thresholds, and the\nterms of the related business agreements.\nCertain of the Company’s contracts may include options to receive additional value-added services and solutions. The Company\naccounts for the option as a distinct performance obligation if the option provides a material right to the customer. Material rights\nare incremental to the standard offerings, which a customer would not have received without entering into the contract. If a\nmaterial right exists in a contract, revenue allocated to the option is deferred and recognized as revenue when those future products\nor services are transferred or when the option expires. The value of the option is based on observable prices in the contract or on a\nrelative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service\nseparately in similar circumstances to similar customers.\nContract assets include unbilled consideration typically resulting from executed value-added services and solutions performed for\ncustomers in connection with Mastercard’s payments network service arrangements. Collection for these services typically occurs\nover the contractual term. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nThe Company defers the recognition of revenue when consideration has been received prior to the satisfaction of performance\nobligations. As these performance obligations are satisfied, revenue is subsequently recognized. Deferred revenue primarily relates\nto certain value-added services and solutions. Deferred revenue is included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nBusiness combinations - The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The\nCompany measures the tangible and intangible identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the\nacquiree and contingent consideration at fair value as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred\nand are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Any excess purchase price\nover the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. Measurement period\nadjustments, if any, to the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangibles assets as of the acquisition date are recorded in\ngoodwill.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets - Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of goodwill and customer relationships. Goodwill\nrepresents the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition date and the assembled workforce. Finite-lived intangible assets\nconsist of capitalized software costs, other intangible assets acquired in business combinations (including customer relationships and\nacquired technology) and other intangible assets. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful\nlives, on a straight-line basis, which range from one to twenty years. Capitalized software includes internal and external costs\nincurred directly related to the design, development and testing phases of each capitalized software project.\nThe valuation methods for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations involve assumptions concerning\ncomparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The\nCompany uses various valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its intangible assets, primarily discounted cash flows\nanalysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets are based on\n76 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nmanagement’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified in Level 3 of the Valuation\nHierarchy (as defined in Fair value subsection below).\nImpairment of assets - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment at the\nreporting unit level in the fourth quarter, or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. The impairment\nevaluation for goodwill utilizes a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.\nThe qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, operating\nenvironment, financial performance and other relevant events. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill is\nimpaired, then the Company is required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill is\nimpaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment charge.\nThe impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate relevant events and\ncircumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the\nqualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, then a quantitative\nassessment is required. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the carrying value, the asset is not impaired.\nIf the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the asset is impaired and the excess of the\nasset’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment charge.\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered\nfrom estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, the fair value of the asset is calculated using the present value\nof estimated net future cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment is recorded.\nImpairment charges, if any, are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\nLitigation - The Company is a party to certain legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. The Company\nevaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and accrues a loss\ncontingency when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies are recorded in provision for litigation on the\nconsolidated statement of operations. These judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings,\nthe merits of its defenses and consultation with in-house and external legal counsel. Legal costs are expensed as incurred and\nrecorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\nSettlement and other risk management - Mastercard’s rules guarantee the settlement of many of the payment network transactions\nbetween its customers. Settlement exposure is the outstanding settlement risk to customers under Mastercard’s rules due to the\ndifference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement. For those transactions the Company\nguarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the settlement obligation to the extent the settlement obligation is not\notherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\nThe Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third\nparties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or\ntransactions with the Company. As the extent of the Company’s obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the\noccurrence of future events, the Company’s potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable.\nThe Company accounts for each of its guarantees by recording the guarantee at its fair value at the inception or modification date\nthrough earnings.\nSettlement assets/obligations - The Company operates systems for settling payment transactions among participants in the\npayments ecosystem in which the Company operates. Settlement is generally completed on a same-day basis. In some\ncircumstances, however, funds may not settle until subsequent business days. In addition, the Company may receive or post funds\nin advance of transactions related to certain payment capabilities over its multi-rail payments network. The Company classifies the\nbalances arising from these various activities as settlement assets and settlement obligations.\nIncome taxes - The Company follows an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes as required under GAAP.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences\nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are\ndisplayed separately as noncurrent assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Valuation allowances are provided\nagainst assets which are not more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes all material tax positions, including\nuncertain tax positions in which it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits and if\nchallenged by the relevant taxing authorities. At each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions are reassessed to\ndetermine whether subsequent developments require a change in the amount of recognized tax benefit. The allowance for\nuncertain tax positions is recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 77\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrecords interest expense related to income tax matters as interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations. The\nCompany includes penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision.\nCash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include certain investments with daily liquidity and with an original maturity\nof three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.\nRestricted cash - The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents as restricted when it is unavailable for withdrawal or use in its\ngeneral operations. The Company has the following types of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents which are included in\nthe reconciliation of beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n• Restricted cash for litigation settlement - The Company had restricted cash for litigation within a qualified settlement fund\nrelated to the settlement agreement for the U.S. merchant class litigation. During 2023, the Company fully reduced its Restricted\ncash for litigation settlement balance as the settlement became final in August 2023. Refer to Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory\nProceedings) for further details.\n• Restricted security deposits held for customers - The Company requires certain customers to enter into risk mitigation\narrangements, including cash collateral and/or other forms of credit enhancement such as letters of credit and guarantees, for\nsettlement of their transactions. Certain risk mitigation arrangements for settlement, such as standby letters of credit and bank\nguarantees, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company also holds cash deposits and certificates of\ndeposit from certain customers as collateral for settlement of their transactions, which are recorded as assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheet. These assets are fully offset by corresponding liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe amount of these security deposits and the duration held are determined by the risk profile of the individual customer and\nthe Company’s risk management practices.\n• Other restricted cash balances - The Company has other restricted cash balances which include contractually restricted deposits,\nas well as cash balances that are restricted based on the Company’s intention with regard to usage. These funds are classified on\nthe consolidated balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets.\nFair value - The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis by estimating the price\nthat would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.\nThe Company also measures certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, when a\nchange in fair value or impairment is evidenced. The Company classifies these recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements\ninto a three-level hierarchy (“Valuation Hierarchy”).\nThe Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement\ndate. A financial instrument’s categorization within the Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement. The three levels of the Valuation Hierarchy are as follows:\n• Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n• Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in inactive markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability.\n• Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be directly corroborated by observable market data.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include investment securities available-for-\nsale, marketable securities, derivative instruments and deferred compensation. The Company’s financial assets measured at fair\nvalue on a nonrecurring basis include nonmarketable securities. The Company’s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis include property, equipment and right-of-use assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and are subject to fair\nvalue adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment.\nContingent consideration - Certain business combinations involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is\ncontingent upon the achievement of performance milestones. These liabilities are classified within Level 3 of the Valuation\nHierarchy as the inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. The fair value of the\ncontingent consideration at the acquisition date and subsequent periods is determined utilizing an income approach based on a\nMonte Carlo technique and is recorded in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes to\nprojected performance milestones of the acquired businesses could result in a higher or lower contingent consideration liability. The\nchanges in fair value as a result of updated assumptions are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated\nstatement of operations.\n78 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInvestment securities - The Company classifies investments as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the date of acquisition.\n• Available-for-sale debt securities:\n◦ Investments in debt securities that are available to meet the Company’s current operational needs are classified as current\nassets and the securities that are not available for current operational needs are classified as noncurrent assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nThe debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a separate component\nof accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Net realized\ngains and losses on debt securities are recognized in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. The\nspecific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses.\nThe Company evaluates its debt securities for impairment on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value\nof a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes an impairment if: (1) it has the intent to sell the\nsecurity; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis;\nor (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component of the\nimpairment is recognized as an allowance and recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of\noperations while the non-credit related loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized from\na sale or subsequent impairment.\n• Held-to-maturity securities:\n◦ Time deposits - The Company classifies time deposits with original maturities greater than three months as held-to-\nmaturity. Held-to-maturity securities that mature within one year are classified as current assets within investments on the\nconsolidated balance sheet while held-to-maturity securities with maturities of greater than one year are classified as other\nassets. Time deposits are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheet and are intended to be held until\nmaturity.\nEquity investments - The Company holds equity securities of publicly traded and privately held companies.\n• Marketable equity securities - Marketable equity securities are strategic investments in publicly traded companies and are\nmeasured at fair value using quoted prices in their respective active markets with changes recorded through gains (losses) on\nequity investments, net on the consolidated statement of operations. Marketable equity securities that are expected to be held\nas part of the Company’s long-term investment strategy are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n• Nonmarketable equity investments - The Company’s nonmarketable equity investments, which are reported in other assets on\nthe consolidated balance sheet, include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values.\nThe Company uses discounted cash flows and market assumptions to estimate the fair value of its nonmarketable equity\ninvestments when certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company’s nonmarketable equity\ninvestments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method or equity method.\n◦ Measurement alternative method - The Company accounts for investments in common stock or in-substance common stock\nunder the measurement alternative method of accounting when it does not exercise significant influence, generally when it\nholds less than 20% ownership in the entity or when the interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company is less\nthan 5% and the Company has no significant influence over the operations of the investee. Investments in companies that\nMastercard does not control, but that are not in the form of common stock or in-substance common stock, are also\naccounted for under the measurement alternative method of accounting. Measurement alternative investments are\nmeasured at cost, less any impairment and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Fair value adjustments, as well as impairments, are\nincluded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statement of operations.\n◦ Equity method - The Company accounts for investments in common stock or in-substance common stock under the equity\nmethod of accounting when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee, generally\nwhen it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity. The excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of\ninvestments accounted for under the equity method is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities\nbased on fair values at the date of acquisition. The amortization of the excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of\ninvestments and Mastercard’s share of net earnings or losses of entities accounted for under the equity method of\naccounting is included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations.\nIn addition, investments in flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies are also\naccounted for under the equity method when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the\noperations of the investee, generally when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of the\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 79\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\noutstanding ownership interest. The Company’s share of net earnings or losses for these investments are included in gains\n(losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statement of operations.\nDerivative and hedging instruments - The Company’s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on\nthe balance sheet and measured at fair value. The Company’s foreign exchange and interest rate derivative contracts are included in\nLevel 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair value of the contracts are based on inputs that are observable based on broker quotes\nfor the same or similar instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nFor derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, realized and unrealized gains and losses from the change in fair value\nof the derivatives are recognized in current earnings.\nThe Company’s derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments are required to meet established accounting criteria. In\naddition, an effectiveness assessment is required to demonstrate that the derivative is expected to be highly effective at offsetting\nchanges in fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposure both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis.\nThe method of assessing hedge effectiveness and measuring hedge results is formally documented at hedge inception and assessed\nat least quarterly throughout the designated hedge period.\nThe Company may designate derivative instruments as cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges, as follows:\n• Cash flow hedges - Fair value adjustments to derivative instruments are recorded, net of tax, in other comprehensive income\n(loss) on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Any gains and losses deferred in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) are subsequently reclassified to the corresponding line item on the consolidated statement of\noperations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings. For hedges that are no longer deemed highly effective,\nhedge accounting is discontinued prospectively, and any gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that the\nforecasted transaction will no longer occur, the associated gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nare reclassified to the corresponding line item on the consolidated statement of operations in current earnings.\n• Fair value hedges - Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the\ngain or loss on the hedged asset or liability (“hedged item”) that is attributable to the hedged risk. All amounts recognized in\nearnings are recorded to the corresponding line item on the consolidated statement of operations as the earnings effect of the\nhedged item. Hedged items are measured on the consolidated balance sheet at their carrying amount adjusted for any changes\nin fair value attributable to the hedged risk (“basis adjustments”). The Company defers the amortization of any basis\nadjustments until the end of the derivative instrument’s term. If the hedge designation is discontinued for reasons other than\nderecognition of the hedged item, the remaining basis adjustments are amortized in accordance with applicable GAAP for the\nhedged item.\n• Net investment hedges - The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries\nare exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or\nderivative instruments to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange\nrates. The effective portion of the foreign currency gains and losses related to the hedging instruments are reported in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet as a cumulative translation adjustment\ncomponent of equity. Gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings only if\nthe Company sells or substantially liquidates its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Amounts excluded from effectiveness\ntesting of net investment hedges are recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. The Company evaluates\nthe effectiveness of the net investment hedge each quarter.\nProperty, equipment and right-of-use assets - Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and\namortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Depreciation of leasehold improvements and amortization of finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization\nexpense on the consolidated statement of operations. Operating lease amortization expense is included in general and\nadministrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company determines if a contract is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. The Company’s right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are\nprimarily related to operating leases for office space, automobiles and other equipment. Leases are included in property, equipment\nand right-of-use assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the\npresent value of lease payments over the lease term. In addition, ROU assets include initial direct costs incurred by the lessee as\nwell as any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, and exclude lease incentives. As most of the Company's\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the\n80 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncommencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined by using\nthe rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments for a\nsimilar term and in a similar economic environment. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is\nreasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases with a term of one year or less are excluded from ROU assets\nand liabilities.\nThe Company excludes variable lease payments in measuring ROU assets and lease liabilities, other than those that depend on an\nindex, a rate or are in-substance fixed payments. Lease and nonlease components are generally accounted for separately. When\navailable, consideration is allocated to the separate lease and nonlease components in a lease contract on a relative standalone price\nbasis using observable standalone prices.\nPension and other postretirement plans - The Company recognizes the funded status of its single-employer defined benefit pension\nplans and postretirement plans as assets or liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet and recognizes changes in the funded status\nin the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The funded status is measured as\nthe difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at December 31, the measurement date.\nOverfunded plans, if any, are aggregated and recorded in other assets, while underfunded plans are aggregated and recorded as\naccrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nNet periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost/(income), excluding the service cost component, is recognized in other income\n(expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations. These costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets,\namortization of prior service costs or credits and gains or losses previously recognized as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss). The service cost component is recognized in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nDefined contribution plans - The Company’s contributions to defined contribution plans are recorded as employees render service to\nthe Company. The charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\nAdvertising and marketing - Expenses incurred to promote Mastercard’s brand, products and services are recognized in advertising\nand marketing on the consolidated statement of operations. The timing of recognition is dependent on the type of advertising or\nmarketing expense.\nForeign currency remeasurement and translation - Monetary assets and liabilities in a currency other than the functional currency\nare remeasured using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at\nhistorical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are remeasured at the weighted-average exchange rate for the period.\nResulting exchange gains and losses related to remeasurement are included in general and administrative expenses on the\nconsolidated statement of operations.\nWhere a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to U.S. dollars is performed for\nbalance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using\na weighted-average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss).\nTreasury stock - The Company records the repurchase of shares of its common stock at cost on the trade date of the transaction.\nThese shares are considered treasury stock, which is a reduction to stockholders’ equity. Treasury stock is included in authorized\nand issued shares but excluded from outstanding shares.\nShare-based payments - The Company measures share-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the estimated fair\nvalue of the award and uses the straight-line method of attribution, net of estimated forfeitures, for expensing awards over the\nrequisite employee service period. The Company estimates the fair value of its non-qualified stock option awards (“Options”) using a\nBlack-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is determined and fixed on the grant date based on\nthe Company’s stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents. The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used\nto determine the grant date fair value of performance stock units (“PSUs”) granted. All share-based compensation expenses are\nrecorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\nRedeemable non-controlling interests - The Company’s business combinations may include provisions allowing non-controlling equity\nowners the ability to require the Company to purchase additional interests in the subsidiary at their discretion. The interests are\ninitially recorded at fair value and in subsequent reporting periods are accreted or adjusted to the estimated redemption value. The\nadjustments to the redemption value are recorded to retained earnings or additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance\nsheet. The redeemable non-controlling interests are considered temporary and reported outside of permanent equity on the\nconsolidated balance sheet at the greater of the carrying amount adjusted for the non-controlling interest’s share of net income\n(loss) or its redemption value.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 81\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEarnings per share - The Company calculates basic earnings per share (“EPS”) by dividing net income by the weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and unvested\nstock units using the treasury stock method. The Company may be required to calculate EPS using the two-class method as a result\nof its redeemable non-controlling interests. If redemption value exceeds the fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests,\nthe excess would be a reduction to net income for the EPS calculation.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures - In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued\naccounting guidance to improve the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and address requests from investors for\nadditional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023, and interim periods after December 15, 2024. The Company will adopt this guidance in its Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2024. This guidance is expected to impact the disclosures only with no impact to the results of\noperations, financial position or cash flows.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures - In December 2023, the FASB issued accounting guidance to enhance the transparency and\ndecision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The guidance includes improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to\nthe rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with\nearly adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating when it will adopt this guidance and the potential effects this\nguidance will have on its disclosures.\nNote 2. Acquisitions\nIn 2023, the Company did not complete any material business acquisitions.\nIn April 2022, Mastercard acquired a 100% equity interest in Dynamic Yield LTD (“Dynamic Yield”) for cash consideration of $325\nmillion. The net assets acquired primarily relate to intangible assets, including goodwill of $200 million that is primarily attributable\nto the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition date. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for local tax\npurposes.\nIn 2021, the Company acquired several businesses for total consideration of $4.7 billion representing both cash and contingent\nconsideration.\nIn March 2021, Mastercard acquired a majority of the Corporate Services business of Nets Denmark A/S (“Nets”) for €3.0 billion\n(approximately $3.6 billion as of the date of acquisition) in cash consideration based on a €2.85 billion enterprise value, adjusted for\ncash and net working capital at closing. The business acquired is primarily comprised of clearing and instant payment services and e-\nbilling solutions. The net assets acquired primarily relate to intangible assets, including goodwill of $2.1 billion, of which $0.8 billion\nis expected to be deductible for local tax purposes. The goodwill arising from this acquisition is primarily attributable to the\nsynergies expected to arise through geographic, product and customer expansion, the underlying technology and workforce\nacquired.\nIn June 2021, Mastercard acquired a 100% equity interest in Ekata, Inc. (“Ekata”) for cash consideration of $861 million, based on an\n$850 million enterprise value, adjusted for cash and net working capital at closing. The acquisition of Ekata is expected to broaden\nthe Company’s digital identity verification capabilities.

Revenue\nMastercard is a payments network service provider that generates revenue from a wide range of payment solutions provided to\ncustomers. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when services are performed in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services (i.e., fees charged to customers). The\nCompany disaggregates its net revenue from contracts with customers into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added\nservices and solutions. The Company’s net revenue categories, payment network and value-added services and solutions, are\nrecognized net of rebates and incentives provided to customers. Rebates and incentives can be either fixed or variable and are\nattributed to the category of revenue to which they pertain.\nPayment network\nMastercard’s payment network involves four participants in addition to the Company: account holders (a person or entity who holds\na card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuers (the account holders’ financial institutions), merchants and acquirers\n(the merchants’ financial institutions). Revenue from the Company’s payment network is primarily generated by charging fees to\ncustomers (issuers, acquirers and other market participants) for providing switching and other network-related services, as well as\nby charging fees to customers based primarily on the gross dollar volume of activity (GDV, which includes both domestic and cross-\nborder volume) on the cards that carry the Company’s brands. As a payments network service provider, the Company provides its\ncustomers with continuous access to its global payments network and stands ready to provide transaction processing over the\ncontractual term. Consideration is variable and is recognized as revenue in the period in which volumes and transactions occur.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 83\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nValue-added services and solutions\nThe Company generates revenues from value-added services and solutions through either fixed or transaction-based fees. These\nservices and solutions can be integrated and sold with the Company’s payment network services or can be sold on a stand-alone\nbasis. These services and solutions primarily include cyber and intelligence, data and services, processing and gateway, ACH batch\nand real-time account-based payments and solutions, open banking and digital identity. Revenue from these value-added services\nand solutions is recognized in the period in which the related services and solutions are performed or transactions occur.\nThe Company’s disaggregated net revenue by category and geographic region were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nRevenue by category:\nPayment network $ 15,824 $ 14,358 $ 11,943\nValue-added services and solutions 9,274 7,879 6,941\nNet revenue $ 25,098 $ 22,237 $ 18,884\nNet revenue by geographic region:\nNorth American Markets 1 $ 8,359 $ 7,809 $ 6,667\nInternational Markets 16,739 14,428 12,217\nNet revenue $ 25,098 $ 22,237 $ 18,884\n1 North American Markets includes the United States and Canada, excluding the U.S. Territories.\nThe Company’s customers are generally billed weekly, with certain billings occurring on a monthly and quarterly basis. The frequency\nof billing is dependent upon the nature of the performance obligation and the underlying contractual terms. The Company does not\ntypically offer extended payment terms to customers.

As a payments network service provider, the Company provides its customers with\ncontinuous access to its global payments network and stands ready to provide transaction processing and related services over the\ncontractual term. Consideration is variable as the Company generates volume- and transaction-based revenues from charging fees\non its customers’ current period activity. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining\nperformance obligations related to its payments network services. The Company also earns revenue from value-added services and\nsolutions. At December 31, 2023, the estimated aggregate consideration allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations for these\nvalue-added services and solutions is $1.5 billion, which is expected to be recognized through 2028. The estimated remaining\nperformance obligations related to these revenues are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including modifications\nand terminations and are not expected to be material to any future annual period.\n84 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8.

Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company’s financial instruments are carried at fair value, cost or amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheet. The\nCompany classifies its fair value measurements of financial instruments into a three-level hierarchy (the “Valuation Hierarchy”).\nFinancial Instruments - Carried at Fair Value\nFinancial instruments carried at fair value are categorized for fair value measurement purposes as recurring or nonrecurring in\nnature.\nRecurring Measurements\nThe distribution of the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis within the Valuation Hierarchy\nwere as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nQuoted Significant Quoted Significant\nPrices Other Significant Prices Other Significant\nin Active Observable Unobservable in Active Observable Unobservable\nMarkets Inputs Inputs Markets Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\n(in millions)\nAssets\nInvestment securities available-for-\nsale 1:\nGovernment and agency securities 33 53 — 86 35 54 — 89\nCorporate securities — 200 — 200 — 183 — 183\nDerivative instruments 2:\nForeign exchange contracts — 36 — 36 — 108 — 108\nMarketable securities 3:\nEquity securities 506 — — 506 399 — — 399\nDeferred compensation plan 4:\nDeferred compensation assets 93 — — 93 74 — — 74\nLiabilities\nDerivative instruments 2:\nForeign exchange contracts $ — $ 104 $ — $ 104 $ — $ 21 $ — $ 21\nInterest rate contracts — 79 — 79 — 105 — 105\nDeferred compensation plan 5:\nDeferred compensation liabilities 91 — — 91 73 — — 73\n1 The Company’s U.S. government securities are classified within Level 1 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair values are based on unadjusted\nquoted prices for identical assets in active markets. The fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale non-U.S. government and agency\nsecurities and corporate securities are based on observable inputs such as quoted prices, benchmark yields and issuer spreads for similar assets\nin active markets and are therefore included in Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy.\n2 The Company’s foreign exchange and interest rate derivative asset and liability contracts have been classified within Level 2 of the Valuation\nHierarchy as the fair value is based on observable inputs such as broker quotes for similar derivative instruments. See Note 23 (Derivative and\nHedging Instruments) for further details.\n3 The Company’s Marketable securities are publicly held and classified within Level 1 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair values are based on\nunadjusted quoted prices in their respective active markets.\n4 The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan where assets are invested primarily in mutual funds held in a rabbi trust, which is\nrestricted for payments to participants of the plan. The Company has elected to use the fair value option for these mutual funds, which are\nmeasured using quoted prices of identical instruments in active markets and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheet.\n5 The deferred compensation liabilities are measured at fair value based on the quoted prices of identical instruments to the investment vehicles\nselected by the participants. These are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n88 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNonrecurring Measurements\nNonmarketable Securities\nThe Company’s Nonmarketable securities are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods after initial recognition under\nthe equity method or measurement alternative method. Nonmarketable securities are classified within Level 3 of the Valuation\nHierarchy due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and unobservable inputs used to measure fair\nvalue that require management’s judgment. The Company uses discounted cash flows and market assumptions to estimate the fair\nvalue of its Nonmarketable securities when certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. See Note 7\n(Investments) for further details.\nFinancial Instruments - Not Carried at Fair Value\nDebt\nDebt instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost. The Company estimates the fair value of its debt\nbased on either market quotes or observable market data. Debt is classified as Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as it is generally\nnot traded in active markets. At December 31, 2023, the carrying value and fair value of debt was $15.7 billion and $14.7 billion,\nrespectively. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value and fair value of debt was $14.0 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively. See\nNote 15 (Debt) for further details.\nOther Financial Instruments\nCertain other financial instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost or amortized cost basis, which\napproximates fair value due to their short-term, highly liquid nature. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents,\nrestricted cash, time deposits, accounts receivable, settlement assets, restricted security deposits held for customers, accounts\npayable, settlement obligations and other accrued liabilities.\nNote 9.

Compensation expense is recorded net of estimated\nforfeitures, with estimates adjusted as appropriate.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 101\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThere are approximately 116 million shares of Class A common stock authorized for equity awards under the LTIP. Although the LTIP\npermits the issuance of shares of Class B common stock, no such shares have been authorized for issuance. Shares issued as a result\nof Option exercises and the conversions of RSUs and PSUs were funded primarily with the issuance of new shares of Class A common\nstock.\nStock Options\nOptions expire ten years from the date of grant and vest ratably over three years for awards granted on or after March 1, 2022. For\nawards granted before March 1, 2022, they vest ratably over four years. For Options granted, a participant’s unvested awards are\nforfeited upon termination. In the event a participant terminates employment due to disability or retirement more than seven\nmonths after receiving the award, however, the participant retains all of their awards without providing additional service to the\nCompany. Retirement eligibility is dependent upon age and years of service. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting\nperiod as stated in the LTIP.\nThe fair value of each Option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table\npresents the weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation and the resulting weighted-average fair value per Option granted\nfor the years ended December 31:\n2023 2022 2021\nRisk-free rate of return 4.2 % 1.6 % 0.9 %\nExpected term (in years) 6.00 6.00 6.00\nExpected volatility 29.5 % 24.6 % 26.1 %\nExpected dividend yield 0.6 % 0.6 % 0.5 %\nWeighted-average fair value per Option granted $ 123.22 $ 86.92 $ 91.70\nThe risk-free rate of return was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant. The expected term and the\nexpected volatility were based on historical Mastercard information. The expected dividend yields were based on the Company’s\nexpected annual dividend rate on the date of grant.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted-\nWeighted- Average\nAverage Remaining Aggregate\nExercise Contractual Intrinsic\nOptions Price Term Value\n(in millions) (in years) (in millions)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 4.7 $ 173\nGranted 0.3 $ 354\nExercised (1.9) $ 124\nForfeited (0.1) $ 338\nExpired 0.0 $ 283\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 3.0 $ 217 5.0 $ 632\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 2.4 $ 184 4.2 $ 581\nOptions vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023 3.0 $ 217 5.0 $ 632\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $16 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested Options.

In 2022, the Company recognized a\ndiscrete tax benefit of $333 million to release the valuation allowance resulting from U.S. tax regulations published in the first\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 105\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nquarter of 2022 (the “2022 Regulations”). In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the 2022 Regulations changed due to\nforeign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”), released by the U.S. Department of Treasury (“Treasury”).\nTherefore, the Company recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance. The\ndiscrete tax expense recognized in 2023 was partially offset by the Company’s ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated\nin 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice released by Treasury.\nThe effective income tax rate for 2022 was lower than the effective income tax rate for 2021, primarily due to a discrete tax benefit\nin the first quarter of 2022 related to final U.S. tax regulations published in 2022. These regulations resulted in a valuation allowance\nrelease of $333 million associated with the U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset. The regulations limited the\nCompany’s ability to generate foreign tax credits starting in 2022 for certain foreign taxes paid, resulting in additional U.S. tax\nexpense. Additionally, a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in 2022 contributed to the lower effective tax rate. The lower\neffective income tax rate in 2022 was partially offset by:\n• the recognition of U.S. tax benefits in 2021 (the majority of which were discrete) resulting from a higher foreign derived\nintangible income deduction and greater utilization of foreign tax credits in the U.S.\n• a discrete tax benefit in 2021 related to the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax asset in the U.K. due to an\nenacted tax rate change in 2021\n• a discrete tax expense related to an unfavorable court ruling in 2022\nSingapore Income Tax Rate\nIn connection with the expansion of the Company’s operations in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, the Company’s\nsubsidiary in Singapore, Mastercard Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. (“MAPPL”) received an incentive grant from the Singapore Ministry of\nFinance in 2010. The incentive had provided MAPPL with, among other benefits, a reduced income tax rate for the 10-year period\ncommencing January 1, 2010 on taxable income in excess of a base amount. The Company continued to explore business\nopportunities in this region, resulting in an expansion of the incentives being granted by the Ministry of Finance, including a further\nreduction to the income tax rate on taxable income in excess of a revised fixed base amount commencing July 1, 2011 and\ncontinuing through December 31, 2025. Without the incentive grant, MAPPL would have been subject to the statutory income tax\nrate on its earnings. For 2023, 2022 and 2021, the impact of the incentive grant received from the Ministry of Finance resulted in a\nreduction of MAPPL’s income tax liability of $571 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, $454 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, and\n$300 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, respectively.\nIndefinite Reinvestment\nAs of December 31, 2023 the Company does not accrue taxes on $3.6 billion of foreign earnings which remain permanently\nreinvested outside the U.S. The Company expects that taxes associated with any future repatriation of these earnings are\nimmaterial.\n106 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8.

Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted after considering facts and\ncircumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation. Within the next\ntwelve months, the Company believes that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local examinations is reasonably\npossible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur. While such a change may be significant, it is\nnot possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statutes of limitation\nexpire. The Company has effectively settled its U.S. federal income tax obligations through 2014. With limited exception, the\nCompany is no longer subject to state and local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2014.\nNote 21. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\nMastercard is a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business.\nSome of these proceedings are based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages.\nAccordingly, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages, and therefore, Mastercard has not\nestablished liabilities for any of these proceedings, except as discussed below. When the Company determines that a loss is both\nprobable and reasonably estimable, Mastercard records a liability and discloses the amount of the liability if it is material. When a\nmaterial loss contingency is only reasonably possible, Mastercard does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the\namount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Unless otherwise stated below\nwith respect to these matters, Mastercard cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss based on one or more of\nthe following reasons: (1) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of monetary damages or the amounts are\nunsupportable or exaggerated, (2) the matters are in early stages, (3) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or\nmotions, (4) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, (5) the proceedings involve multiple defendants or potential\ndefendants whose share of any potential financial responsibility has yet to be determined and/or (6) there are novel legal issues\npresented. Furthermore, except as identified with respect to the matters below, Mastercard does not believe that the outcome of\nany individual existing legal or regulatory proceeding to which it is a party will have a material adverse effect on its results of\noperations, financial condition and overall business. However, an adverse judgment or other outcome or settlement with respect to\nany proceedings discussed below could result in fines or payments by Mastercard and/or could require Mastercard to change its\nbusiness practices. In addition, an adverse outcome in a regulatory proceeding could lead to the filing of civil damage claims and\npossibly result in significant damage awards. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Mastercard’s results of\noperations, financial condition and overall business.\n108 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInterchange Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings\nMastercard’s interchange fees and other practices are subject to regulatory, legal review and/or challenges in a number of\njurisdictions, including the proceedings described below. When taken as a whole, the resulting decisions, regulations and legislation\nwith respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s prospects for future\ngrowth and its overall results of operations and financial condition.\nUnited States. In June 2005, the first of a series of complaints were filed on behalf of merchants (the majority of the complaints\nwere styled as class actions, although a few complaints were filed on behalf of individual merchant plaintiffs) against Mastercard\nInternational, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions. Taken together, the\nclaims in the complaints were generally brought under both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibit monopolization and\nattempts or conspiracies to monopolize a particular industry, and some of these complaints contain unfair competition law claims\nunder state law. The complaints allege, among other things, that Mastercard, Visa, and certain financial institutions conspired to set\nthe price of interchange fees, enacted point-of-sale acceptance rules (including the “no surcharge” rule) in violation of antitrust laws\nand engaged in unlawful tying and bundling of certain products and services, resulting in merchants paying excessive costs for the\nacceptance of Mastercard and Visa credit and debit cards. The cases were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York in MDL No. 1720 (the “U.S. MDL Litigation Cases”). The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class\naction complaint seeking treble damages.\nIn July 2006, the group of purported merchant class plaintiffs filed a supplemental complaint alleging that Mastercard’s initial public\noffering of its Class A Common Stock in May 2006 (the “IPO”) and certain purported agreements entered into between Mastercard\nand financial institutions in connection with the IPO: (1) violate U.S. antitrust laws and (2) constituted a fraudulent conveyance\nbecause the financial institutions allegedly attempted to release, without adequate consideration, Mastercard’s right to assess them\nfor Mastercard’s litigation liabilities. The class plaintiffs sought treble damages and injunctive relief including, but not limited to, an\norder reversing and unwinding the IPO.\nIn February 2011, Mastercard and Mastercard International entered into each of: (1) an omnibus judgment sharing and settlement\nsharing agreement with Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions;\nand (2) a Mastercard settlement and judgment sharing agreement with a number of financial institutions. The agreements provide\nfor the apportionment of certain costs and liabilities which Mastercard, the Visa parties and the financial institutions may incur,\njointly and/or severally, in the event of an adverse judgment or settlement of one or all of the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases. Among a\nnumber of scenarios addressed by the agreements, in the event of a global settlement involving the Visa parties, the financial\ninstitutions and Mastercard, Mastercard would pay 12% of the monetary portion of the settlement. In the event of a settlement\ninvolving only Mastercard and the financial institutions with respect to their issuance of Mastercard cards, Mastercard would pay\n36% of the monetary portion of such settlement.\nIn October 2012, the parties entered into a definitive settlement agreement with respect to the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases (including\nwith respect to the claims related to the IPO) and the defendants separately entered into a settlement agreement with the individual\nmerchant plaintiffs. The settlements included cash payments that were apportioned among the defendants pursuant to the\nomnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing agreement described above. Mastercard also agreed to provide class members\nwith a short-term reduction in default credit interchange rates and to modify certain of its business practices, including its no\nsurcharge rule. The court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2013. Following an appeal by objectors and as a\nresult of a reversal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the district court divided the merchants’ claims into two\nseparate classes - monetary damages claims (the “Damages Class”) and claims seeking changes to business practices (the “Rules\nRelief Class”). The court appointed separate counsel for each class.\nIn September 2018, the parties to the Damages Class litigation entered into a class settlement agreement to resolve the Damages\nClass claims, with merchants representing slightly more than 25% of the Damages Class interchange volume ultimately choosing to\nopt out of the settlement. The district court granted final approval of the Damages Class settlement in December 2019, which was\nupheld by the appellate court in March 2023 and became final in August 2023 pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Mastercard\nhas commenced settlement negotiations with a number of the opt-out merchants and has reached settlements and/or agreements\nin principle to settle a number of these claims.\nSeparately, settlement negotiations with the Rules Relief Class are ongoing. Briefing on summary judgment motions in the Rules\nRelief Class and opt-out merchant cases was completed in December 2020. In September 2021, the district court granted the Rules\nRelief Class’s motion for class certification. In January 2024, the district court denied certain of the defendants’ motions for\nsummary judgment and the parties are awaiting decisions on the remaining motions.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Mastercard had accrued a liability of $596 million and $894 million, respectively, for the U.S.\nMDL Litigation Cases. During 2023, Mastercard reduced both the accrued liability and restricted cash for litigation settlement by\n$600 million, including accrued interest, as the Damages Class settlement became final in August 2023. As such, as of December 31,\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 109\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2023, Mastercard had no balance remaining in a qualified cash settlement fund related to the Damages Class litigation. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company had $589 million in a qualified cash settlement fund classified as restricted cash on its\nconsolidated balance sheet. During 2023, Mastercard recorded additional accruals of $344 million as a result of changes in the\nestimate with respect to the claims of merchants who opted out of the Damages Class litigation. The liability as of December 31,\n2023 for the opt-out merchants represents Mastercard’s best estimate of its probable liabilities in these matters and does not\nrepresent an estimate of a loss, if any, if the matters were litigated to a final outcome. Mastercard cannot estimate the potential\nliability if that were to occur.\nEurope. Since May 2012, a number of United Kingdom (“U.K.”) merchants filed claims or threatened litigation against Mastercard\nseeking damages for excessive costs paid for acceptance of Mastercard credit and debit cards arising out of alleged anti-competitive\nconduct with respect to, among other things, Mastercard’s cross-border interchange fees and its U.K. and Ireland domestic\ninterchange fees (the “U.K. Merchant claimants”). In addition, Mastercard, has faced similar filed or threatened litigation by\nmerchants with respect to interchange rates in other countries in Europe (the “Pan-European Merchant claimants”). Mastercard has\nresolved a substantial amount of these damages claims through settlement or judgment. During 2023, Mastercard incurred charges\nof $195 million as a result of settlements with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants. During 2022, Mastercard incurred\ncharges of $223 million as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants. During\n2021, Mastercard incurred charges of $94 million to reflect both the litigation settlements and estimated attorneys’ fees with a\nnumber of U.K. and Pan-European merchants. Following these settlements, approximately £1 billion (approximately $1.3 billion as\nof December 31, 2023) of unresolved damages claims remain.\nMastercard continues to litigate with the remaining U.K. and Pan-European Merchant claimants and it has submitted statements of\ndefense disputing liability and damages claims. A number of those matters are now progressing with motion practice and discovery.\nA hearing involving multiple merchant cases is scheduled for February 2024 concerning certain liability issues with respect to\nmerchant claims for damages related to post-Interchange Fee Regulation consumer interchange fees as well as commercial and\ninter-regional interchange fees.\nIn a separate matter, Mastercard and Visa were served with a proposed collective action complaint in the U.K. on behalf of\nmerchants seeking damages for commercial card transactions in both the U.K. and the European Union. In June 2023, the court\ndenied the plaintiffs’ collective action application. In December 2023, the plaintiffs filed a revised application claiming damages\nagainst Mastercard in excess of £1 billion (approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2023) and the court has scheduled a\nhearing on this application for April 2024.\nIn September 2016, a proposed collective action was filed in the United Kingdom on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages for\nintra-EEA and domestic U.K. interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by merchants between 1992 and 2008.\nThe complaint, which seeks to leverage the European Commission’s 2007 decision on intra-EEA interchange fees, claims damages in\nan amount that exceeds £10 billion (approximately $13 billion as of December 31, 2023). Following various hearings since July 2017\nregarding collective action and scope, in August 2021, the trial court issued a decision in which it granted class certification to the\nplaintiffs but narrowed the scope of the class. Since January 2023, the trial court has held hearings on various issues, including\nwhether any causal connection existed between the levels of Mastercard’s intra-EEA interchange fees and U.K. domestic interchange\nfees and regarding Mastercard’s request to narrow the number of years of damages sought by the plaintiffs on statute of limitations\ngrounds.\nMastercard has been named as a defendant in a proposed consumer collective action filed in Portugal on behalf of Portuguese\nconsumers. The complaint, which seeks to leverage the 2019 resolution of the European Commission’s investigation of Mastercard’s\ncentral acquiring rules and interregional interchange fees, claims damages of approximately €0.4 billion (approximately $0.4 billion\nas of December 31, 2023) for interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by Portuguese merchants for a period of\napproximately 20 years. Mastercard has submitted a statement of defense that disputes both liability and damages.\nIn April 2023, the Serbian Competition Commission issued a Statement of Objections (“SO”) against Mastercard. The SO covers\nhistoric domestic interchange fees from 2013 to 2018. The SO seeks monetary fines and costs but no business practices changes.\nAustralia. In May 2022, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) filed a complaint targeting certain\nagreements entered into by Mastercard and certain Australian merchants related to Mastercard’s debit program. The ACCC alleges\nthat by entering into such agreements, Mastercard engaged in conduct with the purpose of substantially lessening competition in\nthe supply of debit card acceptance services. The ACCC seeks both declaratory relief and monetary fines and costs. A hearing on\nliability issues has been scheduled for March 2025.\n110 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nATM Non-Discrimination Rule Surcharge Complaints\nUnited States. In October 2011, a trade association of independent Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) operators and 13\nindependent ATM operators filed a complaint styled as a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\nagainst both Mastercard and Visa (the “ATM Operators Complaint”). Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of non-bank operators of\nATM terminals that operate in the United States with the discretion to determine the price of the ATM access fee for the terminals\nthey operate. Plaintiffs allege that Mastercard and Visa have violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by imposing rules that require\nATM operators to charge non-discriminatory ATM surcharges for transactions processed over Mastercard’s and Visa’s respective\nnetworks that are not greater than the surcharge for transactions over other networks accepted at the same ATM. Plaintiffs seek\nboth injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the alleged violations and\ntheir costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees.\nSubsequently, multiple related complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging both federal\nantitrust and multiple state unfair competition, consumer protection and common law claims against Mastercard and Visa on behalf\nof putative classes of users of ATM services (the “ATM Consumer Complaints”). The claims in these actions largely mirror the\nallegations made in the ATM Operators Complaint, although these complaints seek damages on behalf of consumers of ATM services\nwho pay allegedly inflated ATM fees at both bank and non-bank ATM operators as a result of the defendants’ ATM rules. Plaintiffs\nseek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the alleged\nviolations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees.\nIn January 2012, the plaintiffs in the ATM Operators Complaint and the ATM Consumer Complaints filed amended class action\ncomplaints that largely mirror their prior complaints. In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed with the district court their motions for\nclass certification in which the plaintiffs, in aggregate, allege over $1 billion in damages against all of the defendants. In August 2021,\nthe trial court issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ request for class certification. In July 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court affirmed the\ndistrict court order granting class certification. In January 2024, the defendants requested that the U.S. Supreme Court hear the\ndefendants’ appeal of the certification decision.\nEurope. Mastercard was named as a defendant in an action brought by Euronet 360 Finance Limited, Euronet Polska Spolka z.o.o.\nand Euronet Services spol. s.r.o. (“Euronet”) alleging that certain rules affecting ATM access fees in Poland, the Czech Republic and\nGreece by Visa and Mastercard, and certain of their subsidiaries, breach various competition laws. Euronet sought damages, costs\nand injunctive relief to prevent the defendants from enforcing these rules. The matter was resolved via a settlement in October\n2023.\nU.S. Liability Shift Litigation\nIn March 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class action complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa,\nAmerican Express and Discover (the “Network Defendants”), EMVCo, and a number of issuing banks (the “Bank Defendants”)\nengaged in a conspiracy to shift fraud liability for card present transactions from issuing banks to merchants not yet in compliance\nwith the standards for EMV chip cards in the United States (the “EMV Liability Shift”), in violation of the Sherman Act and California\nlaw. Plaintiffs allege damages equal to the value of all chargebacks for which class members became liable as a result of the EMV\nLiability Shift on October 1, 2015. The plaintiffs seek treble damages, attorney’s fees and costs and an injunction against future\nviolations of governing law, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In September 2016, the district court denied the Network\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint, but granted such a motion for EMVCo and the Bank Defendants. In May 2017, the\ndistrict court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases described\nabove. In August 2020, the district court issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ request for class certification and in January 2021,\nthe Network Defendants’ request for permission to appeal that decision was denied. The plaintiffs have submitted expert reports\nthat allege aggregate damages in excess of $1 billion against the four Network Defendants. The Network Defendants have\nsubmitted expert reports rebutting both liability and damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submitted.\nTelephone Consumer Protection Class Action\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) class action pending in Florida. The plaintiffs are\nindividuals and businesses who allege that approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them advertising a Mastercard co-\nbrand card issued by First Arkansas Bank (“FAB”). The TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard\nhas asserted various defenses to the claims, and has notified FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In\nDecember 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply\nto faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In December 2021, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ request\nfor class certification, but narrowed the scope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard’s request to appeal that\ndecision was denied. Briefing on plaintiffs’ motion to amend the class definition and Mastercard’s cross-motion to decertify the\nstand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 111\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. Federal Trade Commission Investigation\nIn June 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Competition (“FTC”) informed Mastercard that it initiated a formal\ninvestigation into compliance with the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In\nparticular, the investigation focused on Mastercard’s compliance with the debit routing provisions of the Durbin Amendment. In\nDecember 2022, the FTC voted to issue an administrative complaint and accept a consent agreement with Mastercard. Pursuant to\nthis agreement, Mastercard agreed to provide primary account numbers (PANs) so that merchants can route tokenized online debit\ntransactions to alternative networks. The consent agreement does not include any monetary penalty. Following a public comment\nperiod, the FTC finalized the consent agreement in May 2023.\nU.S. Department of Justice Investigation\nIn March 2023, Mastercard received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division\n(“DOJ”) seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act. The CID focuses\non Mastercard’s U.S. debit program and competition with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating\nwith the DOJ in connection with the CID.\nNote 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management\nMastercard’s rules guarantee the settlement of many of the payment network transactions between its customers (“settlement\nrisk”). Settlement exposure is the settlement risk to customers under Mastercard’s rules due to the difference in timing between the\npayment transaction date and subsequent settlement. For those transactions the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the\nfull amount of the settlement obligation to the extent the settlement obligation is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the\nsettlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.\nGross settlement exposure is estimated using the average daily payment volume during the three months prior to period end\nmultiplied by the estimated number of days of exposure. The Company has global risk management policies and procedures, which\ninclude risk standards, to provide a framework for managing the Company’s settlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed\nsettlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company’s rules to recover potential\nlosses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures.\nAs part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company’s risk standards to enter into risk\nmitigation arrangements, including cash collateral and/or forms of credit enhancement such as letters of credit and guarantees. This\nrequirement is based on a review of the individual risk circumstances for each customer. Mastercard monitors its credit risk\nportfolio and the adequacy of its risk mitigation arrangements on a regular basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company\nreviews its risk management methodology and standards. As such, the amounts of estimated settlement exposure are revised as\nnecessary.\nThe Company’s estimated settlement exposure was as follows at December 31:\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nGross settlement exposure $ 75,023 $ 64,885\nRisk mitigation arrangements applied to settlement exposure 1 (12,167) (9,224)\nNet settlement exposure 1 $ 62,856 $ 55,661\n1 The Company corrected its estimated net settlement exposure as of December 31, 2022. The correction was not material to the net settlement\nexposures previously reported and had no impact to any of the Company’s financial statement line items.\nMastercard also provides guarantees to customers and certain other counterparties indemnifying them from losses stemming from\nfailures of third parties to perform duties. This includes guarantees of Mastercard-branded travelers cheques issued, but not yet\ncashed of $340 million and $342 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which the Company has risk mitigation\narrangements for $272 million and $273 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the Company enters into\nagreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses\nand expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with the Company.\nCertain indemnifications do not provide a stated maximum exposure. As the extent of the Company’s obligations under these\nagreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, the Company’s potential future liability under these agreements\nis not determinable. Historically, payments made by the Company under these types of contractual arrangements have not been\nmaterial.\n112 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 23. Derivative and Hedging Instruments\nThe Company monitors and manages its foreign currency and interest rate exposures as part of its overall risk management program\nwhich focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of\nthese markets may have on its operating results. A primary objective of the Company’s risk management strategies is to reduce the\nfinancial impact that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates principally through the use of both foreign\nexchange derivative contracts and foreign currency denominated debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate\nderivative contracts to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including\npotential future debt issuances. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts, including forwards and options, to manage the impact of foreign\ncurrency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses, which fluctuate based on currencies other than the functional currency of\nthe entity. The objective of these hedging activities is to reduce the effect of movement in foreign exchange rates for a portion of\nrevenues and expenses forecasted to occur. As these contracts are designated as cash flow hedging instruments, gains and losses\nresulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are\nsubsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings.\nIn addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the\nCompany’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances, and designate such derivatives as hedging\ninstruments in a cash flow hedging relationship. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred\nin accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the\nrespective terms of the hedged debt issuances. As of December 31, 2023, a cumulative loss of $118 million, after tax, remains in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with these contracts and will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest\nexpense over the respective terms of the 2020 USD Notes due in March 2030 and March 2050.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to manage the effects of interest rate\nmovements on the fair value of the Company's fixed-rate debt and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a fair value\nhedging relationship. Changes in fair value of these contracts and changes in fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in\nthe hedged benchmark interest rate generally offset each other and are recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statement\nof operations. Gains and losses related to the net settlements of interest rate swaps are also recorded in interest expense on the\nconsolidated statement of operations. The periodic cash settlements are included in operating activities on the consolidated\nstatement of cash flows.\nIn 2021, the Company entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge related to $1.0 billion of the 3.850% Senior\nNotes due March 2050. In effect, the interest rate swap synthetically converts the fixed interest rate on this debt to a variable\ninterest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) Overnight Index Swap Rate. The net impact to interest\nexpense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was not material.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge a portion of its net\ninvestment in foreign subsidiaries against adverse movements in exchange rates. The effective portion of the net investment hedge\nis recorded as a currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Forward points are excluded\nfrom the effectiveness assessment and are recognized in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of\noperations over the hedge period. The amounts recognized in earnings related to forward points for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not\nmaterial.\nIn 2015 and 2022, the Company designated its €1,650 million and €750 million euro-denominated debt, respectively, as hedges of a\nportion of its net investment in its European operations. In 2022, €700 million of the 2015 euro-denominated debt matured and was\nde-designated as a net investment hedge. In 2023, the Company de-designated an aggregate notional amount of €2,825 million\nforeign exchange derivative contracts and €109 million of the euro-denominated debt as net investment hedges to effectively\nmanage changes in its net investment exposures in foreign subsidiaries. The Company accounts for the de-designated foreign\nexchange derivative contracts as economic hedges as of the de-designation date. The foreign currency transaction gains and losses\non the euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recorded in general and\nadministrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations, net as of the de-designation date. The de-designated foreign\nexchange derivative contracts and euro-denominated debt will serve as economic hedges to offset possible changes in monetary\nassets due to foreign exchange fluctuations.\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 113\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had €1.6 billion and €1.7 billion euro-denominated debt outstanding designated as\nhedges of a portion of its net investment in its European operations, respectively. During 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company\nrecorded a pre-tax net foreign currency loss of $67 million, gain of $176 million and gain of $155 million, respectively, in other\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had net foreign currency gains of $181 million and $309 million, after tax,\nrespectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with this hedging activity.\nNon-designated Derivatives\nThe Company may also enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to serve as economic hedges, such as to offset possible\nchanges in the value of monetary assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations, without designating these derivative\ncontracts as hedging instruments. In addition, the Company is subject to foreign exchange risk as part of its daily settlement\nactivities. This risk is typically limited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent\nsettlement with customers. To manage this risk, the Company may enter into short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts\nbased upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective currency position. The objective of these activities is to\nreduce the Company’s exposure to volatility arising from gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against its\nfunctional currencies. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in general and\nadministrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations, net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on\nmonetary assets and liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments and the related notional amounts:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDerivative Derivative Derivative Derivative\nNotional Assets Liabilities Notional Assets Liabilities\n(in millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nForeign exchange contracts in a cash flow hedge 1 $ 1,006 $ 2 $ 25 $ 642 $ 4 $ 15\nInterest rate contracts in a fair value hedge 2 1,000 — 79 1,000 — 105\nForeign exchange contracts in a net investment hedge 1 — — — 1,814 103 4\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nForeign exchange contracts 1 5,424 34 79 521 1 2\nTotal derivative assets/liabilities $ 7,430 $ 36 $ 183 $ 3,977 $ 108 $ 126\n1 Foreign exchange derivative assets and liabilities are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other current liabilities,\nrespectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.\n2 Interest rate derivative liabilities are included within other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe pre-tax gain (loss) related to the Company's derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are as follows:\nGain (Loss) Recognized in OCI Gain (Loss) Reclassified from AOCI\nYear ended December 31, Location of Gain Year ended December 31,\n(Loss) Reclassified\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021\nfrom AOCI into\n(in millions) Earnings (in millions)\nDerivative financial instruments in a\ncash flow hedge relationship:\nForeign exchange contracts $ (41) $ 1 $ 6 Net revenue $ (29) $ 16 $ 1\nInterest rate contracts $ — $ — $ — Interest expense $ (6) $ (6) $ (6)\nDerivative financial instruments in a\nnet investment hedge relationship:\nForeign exchange contracts $ (98) $ 177 $ 114\nThe Company estimates that the pre-tax amount of the net deferred loss on cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2023 that will be reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations within the\nnext 12 months is not material. The term of the foreign exchange derivative contracts designated in hedging relationships are\ngenerally less than 18 months.\n114 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe amount of gain (loss) recognized on the consolidated statement of operations for non-designated derivative contracts is\nsummarized below:\nYear ended December 31,\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments: 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nForeign exchange contracts\nGeneral and administrative $ 42 $ 21 $ (10)\nThe Company’s derivative financial instruments are subject to both market and counterparty credit risk. Market risk is the potential\nfor economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as\nforeign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other related variables. Counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure\nof the counterparty to perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms. The Company’s derivative contracts are subject\nto enforceable master netting arrangements, which contain various netting and setoff provisions. However, the Company has\nelected to present derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheet. To mitigate counterparty\ncredit risk, the Company enters into derivative contracts with a diversified group of selected financial institutions based upon their\ncredit ratings and other factors. Generally, the Company does not obtain collateral related to derivatives because of the high credit\nratings of the counterparties.\nNote 24. Segment Reporting\nMastercard has concluded it has one reportable operating segment, “Payment Solutions.” Mastercard’s Chief Executive Officer has\nbeen identified as the chief operating decision-maker. All of the Company’s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent\nupon and supportive of the other. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of Mastercard at the\nconsolidated level.\nRevenue by geographic market is based on the location of the Company’s customer that issued the card, the location of the\nmerchant acquirer where the card is being used or the location of the customer receiving services. Revenue generated in the U.S.\nwas approximately 30% of net revenue in 2023, 33% in 2022 and 32% in 2021. No individual country, other than the U.S., generated\nmore than 10% of net revenue in those periods.

This includes obligating\nissuers and acquirers to screen account holders and merchants, respectively, against the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets\nControl’s (“OFAC”) sanctions lists, including the List of Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN list”).\nWe identified through our compliance program that for the period covered by this Report:\n• acquirers located in the Europe and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa regions each acquired transactions over our\nnetwork for an Iranian airline\n• during the three months ended March 31, 2023, an acquirer located in the Asia/Pacific region acquired transactions\nover our network for consular services with an Iranian embassy\n• during the three months ended December 31, 2023, an acquirer located in the Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa\nregion acquired transactions over our network for consular services with an Iranian embassy\nOFAC regulations and other legal authorities provide exemptions for certain activities involving dealings with Iran. However,\nSection 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 requires us to disclose whether we, or any of our\naffiliates, have knowingly engaged in certain transactions or dealings involving the Government of Iran or with certain persons\nor entities found on the SDN list, regardless of whether these dealings constitute a violation of OFAC regulations.\nWe do not calculate net revenues or net profits associated with specific merchants (our customers’ customers). However, we\nused our fee schedule and the aggregate number and amount of transactions involving the above merchants to estimate the\nnet revenue and net profit we obtained with respect to the period covered by this Report. Both the number of transactions\nand our estimated net revenue and net profits for this period are de minimis."

There’s the potential for us all to do more and do it faster, bringing millions more\npeople into the digital economy for the first time.\nWe’re steering and supporting this momentum in our industry.\nWorking closely with our many partners, Mastercard created many of the payments technologies –\ncontactless cards, tokenization, cybersecurity defenses – that make this digitization possible. People\nuse our global network hundreds of millions of times a day to safely and easily transfer money, make\npayments and get paid.\nWe are pursuing a future that accelerates these changes to deliver more value, stronger relationships\nand greater efficiency. Banking and retail experiences that can be more personalized. Commercial\nservices that simplify processes for businesses of all sizes. AI-powered cybersecurity that allows us all\nto stay one step ahead of scammers.\nThis is how we’re powering economies and empowering people. It’s how we are helping to build\nresilience. And we are just getting started.\nOur 2023 at a glance\nIn 2023, we delivered another strong year as we remained focused on the strategic priorities that fuel\nour growth algorithm across payments, services and new networks.\nThe numbers speak for themselves, with net revenue, gross dollar volume and switched transactions all\ngrowing by double digits last year.\nOur joint venture in China received government approval, setting the stage for us to start processing\ndomestic transactions in the second most-populous nation in the world for the first time.\nThe impact of our work was widely recognized. We ranked No. 1 on Fair360’s list of top companies for\ndiversity. We again topped the International Institute for Management Development’s Future\nReadiness list. Our brand – ranked as one of the top 10 in the world by Kantar BrandZ – stands for\ntrust, reliability and priceless experiences.\nMomentum continues into 2024. We see significant runway to keep growing the choices people and\nbusinesses have in payments and beyond.\n4 2024 MASTERCARD PROXY\nANNUAL LETTERS FROM MASTERCARD LEADERSHIP 2024\nHow we power economies\nOur growth algorithm is about capturing the natural growth of economies, accelerating the secular shift to electronic\npayments, further penetrating the addressable market in new flows and growing our share of the market. It’s also\nabout growing in services and new networks by scaling our solutions to existing and new customer types, while\ncontinuing to build and deploy new solutions.\nHere’s what that looks like in the real world:\nExpanding in payments People have a choice in how they pay – card, account-to-account, buy now pay later and more.\nOur focus is on giving them a reason to choose Mastercard across all these areas. And they are.\nWe’re winning new business in consumer payments – proof that our efforts to expand digitization are working. Two\nquick examples – last year, we significantly expanded our partnership with UniCredit, with the group deciding to use\nMastercard across 12 markets and 13 of its banks. In the U.S., we became the exclusive payments network for Citizens\nBank, one of three regulated debit financial institutions to make that decision in 2023.\nThis is balanced with more merchants choosing to accept Mastercard. When new merchants – no matter how small or\nhow remote – tap into our network, they can immediately reach a thriving global digital market.\nPeople have a choice in how\nAnd we’re creating these ripple effects in other payment flows.\nthey pay – card, account-to-\nOur work in commercial payments has expanded into education, travel and many other new kinds of business.

Our focus is on\nFor example, some healthcare providers are using our virtual cards to replace the cumbersome process of manually\ngiving them a reason to\nsubmitting claims – unlocking faster, more reliable, more efficient commerce. Taken together, these commercial\nchoose Mastercard across all\nmarkets offer a significant opportunity to expand our business and drive long-term growth.\nthese areas. And they are.\nExtending our services Payments and services are deeply interconnected. As we help digitize more payments, that\nopens more opportunities for us to deliver value-added services – including data insights, consulting and cybersecurity.\nThe growth of those services drives more digital payments – and that flywheel keeps turning. Our value-added services\nand solutions now account for more than 35% of revenue and grew faster than our payment network last year.\nOur focus in services is all about creating efficiency and value. For example, Mastercard has been using predictive AI for\nyears, especially in our cybersecurity solutions and fraud detection work to protect the billions of transactions that run\nthrough our network. To keep up this work, earlier this year we unveiled Decision Intelligence Pro, which uses generative\nAI to predict the authenticity of transactions, boosting banks' fraud detection work.\nThere is still more predictive AI can deliver even as we explore the potential in generative AI. We are working to\nintegrate AI into even more of what we do in a principled manner to make every digital experience even smarter, even\nsafer and even more personalized.\n2024 MASTERCARD PROXY 5\nANNUAL LETTERS FROM MASTERCARD LEADERSHIP 2024\nOur approach to AI is the same as with any other technology – we’re focused on trust, security and consumer\nprotections first. That’s why this year we continued to evolve our data and tech responsibility principles – security and\nprivacy, transparency, accountability, fairness, inclusion, innovation, social impact – to ensure they remain relevant and\nvaluable guardrails. And we are using them to collaborate with partners and help shape trustworthy standards across\nindustries, including through the U.S. AI Safety Institute Consortium.\nEmbracing new networks We’re always looking to grow in adjacent spaces, using our expertise running a global\npayments network to create value for new and current customers. Our work to develop new ways to integrate digital\nidentification and open banking to integrate both technologies into our core payments and services is an example of\nthis effort. For instance, digital ID has quickly become a vital way for people in many countries to access government\nservices, vote and shop online. Our open banking assets provide connectivity to more than 95% of deposit accounts in\nthe U.S. and approximately 3,000 banks across Europe. Those connections allow consumers to seamlessly share data\nbetween trusted parties and improve the bill pay experience for customers of Verizon and Worldpay. There’s even\ngreater opportunity ahead as we bring digital ID and open banking together.\nHow we empower people\nThis only happens because our people make it possible – all 33,000+ Mastercard colleagues – coders, consultants,\neconomists, cybersecurity experts, everyone.\nOur culture and the way we\nOur culture and the way we work together combines high performance with high empathy. That’s how we achieve\nwork together combines high\neverything we do. The Mastercard Way is our guiding star for how we do it, focused on three tenets:\nperformance with high\n• Create value – for our partners, teams and investors by thinking big and bold, and innovating\nempathy.

We are executing on this strategy through a focus on three key priorities:\n• expand in payments for consumers, businesses and governments\n• extend our services to enhance transactions and drive customer value\n• embrace new network opportunities to enable open banking, digital identity and other adjacent network capabilities\nThese priorities are supported by six key drivers: People, Brand, Data, Technology, Franchise, and Doing well by doing good.

We view this level of stockholder support as affirmation of our current pay programs and our pay for performance philosophy.\n2024 MASTERCARD PROXY 17\nPROXY SUMMARY\nThe Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC) and management regularly review our compensation and benefit programs.

The program is designed to attract, motivate and retain senior executives to achieve financial and strategic results that\ncreate sustainable value for stockholders, primarily through grants of long-term equity awards rather than annual cash compensation. While our incentive\nprograms are substantially formulaic, the HRCC retains discretion to make adjustments to ensure that compensation appropriately reflects operating\nperformance and to achieve desired talent management objectives, including the engagement and retention of leadership talent needed to execute our business\nstrategy and create long-term value for stockholders.\nStockholder feedback\nAt our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, 96% of the votes cast on the annual say-on-pay proposal were in support of our executive compensation program.\nWe view this level of stockholder support as affirmation of our current pay programs and our pay for performance philosophy.\nThe HRCC, with input from the independent compensation consultant, considered the vote results, input from investors and current market practices as it\nevaluated whether changes to the compensation program were warranted.\n2024 MASTERCARD PROXY 63\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n2023 financial and operational highlights\nThe following are our key financial and operational highlights for 2023, including growth rates over the prior year:\nGAAP Cash flow from\nCapital returned to stockholders in 2023\noperations\nNet revenue Net income Diluted EPS\n$25.1B $11.2B $11.83 Repurchased\nTotal shares Dividends 2023\nup 13% up 13% up 16%\n$11.2B $9.0B $2.2B $12.0B\nNON-GAAP1 (currency-neutral)\nAdjusted net revenue Adjusted net income Adjusted diluted EPS\n$25.1B $11.6B $12.26 Stock price growth since IPO (2006)\nup 13% up 12% up 15%\nGross dollar volume Cross-border Switched\n(growth on a local volume growth transactions\ncurrency basis) (on a local\ncurrency basis)\n$9.0T 143.2B\nup 24%\nup 12% up 14%\n1 Non-GAAP results (including growth rates) exclude the impact of gains and losses on equity\ninvestments, Special Items and/or foreign currency.

In\nFebruary 2021, the HRCC determined that the payout rate for the 2021 PSUs would be tied to performance against a one-year adjusted EPS growth goal and\nmodified by Mastercard’s three-year relative TSR performance against S&P 500 companies. The EPS performance target and payout scale for our 2021 PSUs\nwere automatically adjusted per the award terms based on the variance between budgeted and actual PCE and cross-border travel.\nThe following table shows the performance assessment against the PCE and cross-border adjusted EPS metric:\nMeasurement Threshold1 Target1 Maximum1 Actual Score\nOne-year adjusted EPS growth2 11.2% 16.2% 20.2% 30.6% 150.0%\n1 PCE and cross-border travel was collectively 220 bps (basis points) above the forecast, and, as such, the original EPS target and payout scale was automatically adjusted upward by 220 bps\naccordingly.\n2 Results shown differ from 2021 EPS growth under GAAP because they exclude certain 2021 acquisitions, the impact of gains and losses on equity investments and special items (which represent\nlitigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items), translational and transactional impacts of foreign currency, and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivatives designated\nas cash flow hedging instruments. The actual impact on EPS from share buybacks versus the initial assumed impact did not result in any change to the final PSU score.\nThe following table shows the relative TSR performance assessment beginning on the grant date of March 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2023.

payment over an 18-month period and is equal to 1.5 times the sum of the executive’s 2023 base\nsalary plus bonus paid for services in 2022 (although Mastercard has discretion to provide such cash severance for up to 24 months). The amounts payable in connection with a change in control\nwould be paid over a 24-month period and is equal to two times the sum of the executive’s 2023 base salary and the average of bonus paid for services in 2021 and 2022. Cash severance reflects the\npresent value of this calculation using a discount rate of 6.33%, equal to 120% of the semiannual applicable short-term federal rates for December 2023. Cash severance amounts payable in\nconnection with a change in control reflect any applicable reduction needed to avoid the excise tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 280G, as required under Mastercard's Change in Control\nSeverance Plan if that would give the executive officer a better after-tax result.\n2 For the PSUs in the “Change in control” column, the amount reflects a change in control of Mastercard in which the company thereafter is unable to assess its performance against the specified\nobjectives. Accordingly, consistent with the terms of the PSU awards, the amounts represented in the “Death” and “Change in control” columns represent target levels of performance (with respect\nto awards granted in 2021, 2022 and 2023), as do the amounts in the “Disability” column. Further details with respect to these awards are included in Note 18 (Share-Based Payments) in\nMastercard’s 2023 Form 10-K. The deferred PSUs are not included in the above Potential payments tables. The payment of deferred PSUs will be accelerated upon the NEO’s death or qualifying\ntermination with six months preceding or two years following a change in control. The value of the deferred PSUs (including dividend equivalents) based on the closing market price per share of Class\nA common stock on the NYSE on the last trading day of 2023 is as follows: $1,402,420 for Mr. Miebach, $611,926 for Mr. Mehra, $1,118,939 for Mr. Vosburg, $1,110,375 for Mr. Murphy, $408,094\nfor Mr. McLaughlin, and $1,118,939 for Mr. Froman, as further disclosed in the 2023 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table.\n3 Includes continued health and welfare benefits; namely, health coverage, dental coverage, vision coverage, individual life insurance and individual disability insurance for 18 months following\ntermination and outplacement assistance.\n4 Amount is included in the “Voluntary” column for Messrs. Miebach, Vosburg, Murphy, McLaughlin and Froman because they have each satisfied the age and service requirements for retirement\neligibility. Mr. Froman moved into a part-time position on June 1, 2023, and the Annual Incentive Award represents the actual prorated 2023 bonus paid.\n2024 MASTERCARD PROXY 101\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nEquity compensation plan information\nThe table below presents information as of December 31, 2023 for the LTIP and our Amended and Restated 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation\nPlan, both of which previously have been approved by stockholders.

Mr. Miebach’s annual\ntotal compensation for 2023 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table was $25,746,498. Accordingly, for 2023, the ratio of the compensation of our\nCEO to the compensation for our median employee was estimated to be 183 to 1.\nConsistent with last year, we used the following methodology to identify the median employee:\n• We collected employee data of all employees globally, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or temporary basis as of December 31, 2023\n• We annualized the compensation of all new employees (other than temporary employees) who were hired by the company between January 1 and\nDecember 31, 2023 to reflect their estimated compensation over the entire year\n• We applied an exchange rate as of December 1, 2023 to convert all international currencies into U.S. dollars\n• We used total base pay and annual bonus target as of December 31, 2023 and actual long-term incentive award granted in 2023 as our consistently applied\ncompensation measure\nWe believe our pay ratio presented above is a reasonable estimate. As SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow\ncompanies to use different methodologies, estimates and assumptions, our pay ratio may not be comparable with the pay ratios reported by other companies.\nFurthermore, the SEC has stated that it did not believe a purpose of the pay ratio rule was to facilitate comparisons among companies.\n2024 MASTERCARD PROXY 103\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nPay versus performance disclosure\nThe following table reports the compensation of our Principal Executive Officer (PEO) and the average compensation of the other NEOs as disclosed in the\nSummary Compensation Table for the past four fiscal years, as well as their “compensation actually paid,” as calculated pursuant to recently adopted SEC rules,\nand certain performance measures required by the rules.
