It is consistent with recommendations made in the [National Cybersecurity Strategy](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acn.gov.it%2Fportale%2Fstrategia-nazionale-di-cybersicurezza&esheet=54155005&newsitemid=20241121695090&lan=en-US&anchor=National+Cybersecurity+Strategy&index=6&md5=f25a196dea3397617250ccd72fe34154), which was developed to plan, coordinate and implement measures to make Italy safer and more resilient. Because public administrative bodies generate, manage and store increasingly large amounts of sensitive data, they are highly valued targets for cyberattack, making cloud security a top priority. \n\nACN is the Italian national cybersecurity authority, chartered to protect national cybersecurity interests. It is responsible for protecting security and increasing resilience, preventing from and mitigating against IT attacks and to promote the achievement of technological autonomy. One of its main priorities is the implementation of the [National Cybersecurity Strategy](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acn.gov.it%2Fportale%2Fstrategia-nazionale-di-cybersicurezza&esheet=54155005&newsitemid=20241121695090&lan=en-US&anchor=National+Cybersecurity+Strategy&index=7&md5=b2021b2ca9f8db93010dbd80be6a1d83). \n\nThe CyberArk Identity Security Platform applies the right level of privilege controls to all identities, human and machine, with continuous threat detection and prevention across the entire identity lifecycle.

The service secures privileged access with vaulted credentials or Zero Standing Privileges, across shared and federated access models, while isolating and monitoring sessions to provide scalable risk reduction to the enterprise. \n  * [ **CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager** ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberark.com%2Fproducts%2Fendpoint-privilege-security%2F&esheet=54155005&newsitemid=20241121695090&lan=en-US&anchor=CyberArk+Endpoint+Privilege+Manager&index=11&md5=cbb0b9c0593457fc8eaa5e59bb2e604a) secures all human identities by extending identity security and Zero Trust to workstations and servers. It enables organizations to discover and remove local admin rights, enforce role-based least privilege, detect and defend against identity-based threats and get better visibility into credential-based attack paths and exposures. By reducing the endpoint attack surface and implementing comprehensive application control, it effectively defends against zero-day attacks, ransomware, and insider threats. Intelligent endpoint privilege controls and integrations with third-party solutions help automate workflows to reduce operational expenses and improve end user experience. Additionally, it helps achieve and demonstrate compliance with audit recommendations and regulations and meet cyber insurers’ requirements. \n\n\n\n\"Government bodies face numerous cloud-based risks that arise from new, dynamic environments and technologies,” said Eduarda Camacho, Chief Operating Officer at CyberArk. “Already in 2024 CyberArk SaaS solutions achieved [ FedRAMP ® High Authorization to Operate ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberark.com%2Fpress%2Fcyberark-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization%2F&esheet=54155005&newsitemid=20241121695090&lan=en-US&anchor=FedRAMP%26%23174%3B+High+Authorization+to+Operate&index=12&md5=77280e8bbfcf371d7a0d27a7a0c29445) (ATO) in the United States.

Having previously adopted a multi-layer security strategy, it still faced the challenge of unifying and protecting privileged access to its applications, servers and cloud services, which had been managed in a siloed way. This approach impacted incident response times and, because of an overall lack of visibility, potentially exposed the company to internal and external threats. Passwords were also managed separately in individual systems, so failures to change passwords after individuals transferred departments or left the company meant further risk exposure. \n\nTo be able to discover, secure and manage all identities on a single platform, Konoike Transport implemented [CyberArk Privileged Access Manager](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberark.com%2Fproducts%2Fprivileged-access-manager%2F&esheet=54153494&newsitemid=20241122141163&lan=en-US&anchor=CyberArk+Privileged+Access+Manager&index=4&md5=dc2a74fd95312c59a110a87bc08d00e5), a component of the [CyberArk Identity Security Platform](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberark.com%2Fproducts%2F&esheet=54153494&newsitemid=20241122141163&lan=en-US&anchor=CyberArk+Identity+Security+Platform&index=5&md5=b5760e0be28f6d757d76ca917924c99b). With a unified view of all privileged accounts, it now has a clear insight into user access within a few clicks. Besides better incident response time, with a log of all accounts, Konoike Transport can now conduct audits and meet compliance requirements such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act more efficiently. Further, CyberArk’s ability to enable cloud-based privileged access within a single architecture fits perfectly into Konoike Transport’s cloud-first strategy. \n\nMasaya Sato, Deputy Executive General Manager, ICT Promotion Division and General Manager, Digital Transformation Promotion Department, Konoike Transport said,“With CyberArk, our security is significantly boosted. End users now have secure access without sacrificing convenience and administrators can monitor multiple systems in an integrated manner, greatly reducing our attack surface.” \n\n“CyberArk is honored to be chosen by Konoike Transport to centralize its privileged access management,” said Mitsuro Kakizawa, Regional Director for Japan, CyberArk. “Threat actors seek out unsecured privileged accounts to enter an organization’s IT environment. CyberArk enables the highest levels of control, management and security for Konoike Transport’s privileged identities, adding a critical protection layer to the company’s key assets and supporting its digital transformation journey.” \n\nFor more information, please visit: [https://www.cyberark.com/customer-stories/konoike-transport-improves-identity-security-posture-by-200-with-cyberark-privilege-cloud/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberark.com%2Fcustomer-stories%2Fkonoike-transport-improves-identity-security-posture-by-200-with-cyberark-privilege-cloud%2F&esheet=54153494&newsitemid=20241122141163&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberark.com%2Fcustomer-stories%2Fkonoike-transport-improves-identity-security-posture-by-200-with-cyberark-privilege-cloud%2F&index=6&md5=691376c0b5f58f0deb5ffd43e7b8939c)\n\n**About CyberArk**\n\n[CyberArk](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberark.com%2F&esheet=54153494&newsitemid=20241122141163&lan=en-US&anchor=CyberArk&index=7&md5=a3fee3111add85f2dcc2b94ade50f14c) (NASDAQ: [CYBR](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.cyberark.com%2F&esheet=54153494&newsitemid=20241122141163&lan=en-US&anchor=CYBR&index=8&md5=746d1c797ece3091b62c8f328c01c023) ) is the global leader in identity security.

The two companies are joining forces to enable customers to strengthen their multi-cloud security posture with best-in-class visibility and control over privileged human and machine access, without impacting the speed and scale of cloud development. A central component of the partnership is an integration between the [CyberArk Identity Security Platform](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberark.com%2Fproducts%2F&esheet=54151273&newsitemid=20241113597984&lan=en-US&anchor=CyberArk+Identity+Security+Platform&index=4&md5=7e857189322d929c719ecb943a22934c) and the [Wiz Cloud Security Platform](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiz.io%2Fplatform&esheet=54151273&newsitemid=20241113597984&lan=en-US&anchor=Wiz+Cloud+Security+Platform&index=5&md5=6fd1889fb50c99bb126ea781e49a2983), available to customers immediately. \n\nCloud-native organizations with extensive multi-cloud environments are facing rapidly changing new environments and exponentially more identities, creating circumstances that are challenging for traditional security approaches. The lack of visibility and inability to manage the privileged access that developers often grant themselves results in greater vulnerability, risk and compliance issues. \n\n“Organizations like Encova have thousands of entitlements and permissions across their cloud environments. Visibility of excessive permissions and the extent of privileged access in these environments is often difficult to ascertain, creating not only unquantified security risk but also operational inefficiencies,” said Tony DeAngelo, CISO at Encova Insurance. “The Wiz and CyberArk integration is a positive step that will allow security teams to gain insight into risky cloud access and use that knowledge to enhance identity security for IT, CloudOps, developer and machine identities, which are often highly privileged.” \n\n“The integration of Wiz and CyberArk is a gamechanger for our enterprise customers,” said Hauke Moritz, Solution Manager for Cloud Security at Computacenter, a leading independent technology and services provider. “Larger organizations manage a multitude of development projects with numerous identities and entitlements distributed across hybrid cloud environments. Gaining clear visibility into the scope of privileged access, the surplus of entitlements and enforcing proper security controls are critical for reducing risk and preventing security incidents. Now, companies can effectively mitigate cloud access risks and increase their security resilience while benefiting from more efficient identity management.” \n\nBy combining Wiz’s capabilities for discovering toxic combinations of critical risks and misconfigured cloud access with CyberArk’s capabilities for implementing Zero Standing Privileges, cloud security teams can measurably reduce the risk of unauthorized access and rapidly satisfy audit and compliance requirements. As part of the partnership, CyberArk is joining the [Wiz Integration Network](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiz.io%2Fintegrations&esheet=54151273&newsitemid=20241113597984&lan=en-US&anchor=Wiz+Integration+Network&index=6&md5=f9142224998393565607607b35c4c100) (WIN), and Wiz is joining the [ CyberArk C 3 Alliance ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberark.com%2Fpartners%2Falliance-partners%2F&esheet=54151273&newsitemid=20241113597984&lan=en-US&anchor=CyberArk+C3+Alliance&index=7&md5=8279731fbede876f004649f1605035c7). \n\n“We are thrilled to partner with CyberArk to help customers secure human and machine identities in the cloud,” said Oron Noah, VP, Product Extensibility & Partnerships at Wiz. “By combining Wiz’s ability to analyze cloud entitlements with CyberArk’s ability to enforce dynamic privilege controls to all identities, we are enabling our customers to scale their cloud operations while ensuring that privileged access is identified and fully controlled across their multi-cloud environments.” \n\n“Cloud development is a primary driver of vast numbers of new human and machine identities that are being created every day, by different siloes within the organization and with differing – often unmanaged – permissions and access levels,” said Clarence Hinton, Chief Strategy Officer at CyberArk. “For security teams to keep up, there is a need to rethink our approach to how these identities are discovered and secured so that this significant attack surface is understood and can be acted on.

This acquisition enables CyberArk to further deliver on its vision to secure every identity – human and machine – with the right level of privilege controls. Together, CyberArk and Venafi will build end-to-end machine identity security solutions that help organizations vastly improve security and stop costly outages. Venafi adds complementary solutions that expand CyberArk’s total addressable market by $10 billion to approximately $60 billion. \n\n“We are thrilled to officially welcome the exceptional Venafi team to CyberArk. Over the past months, every interaction has further validated that this acquisition is a great fit from all perspectives – technology, people, culture and spirit of innovation,” said Matt Cohen, Chief Executive Officer, CyberArk. “Machines are the fastest growing and most complex identity and today, many organizations rely on manual processes and siloed tools to secure and manage them. By joining forces, CyberArk and Venafi will set a new paradigm, with the industry’s most comprehensive platform for end-to-end machine identity security at enterprise scale.” \n\nOngoing digital transformation, pervasive cloud computing and the rise of AI are driving an exponential increase in the number of machine identities, which can outnumber human identities by as much as 45-to-1, many of which remain undetected. If left unprotected and unmanaged, these identities can serve as a lucrative hunting ground for cybercriminals who seek to exploit their vulnerabilities. A new paradigm is required to keep pace with this rapid proliferation – shifting from inefficient manual, siloed approaches that create compliance and security risks to centralized management of machine identities across all applications and workloads for any cloud or IT environment at scale. \n\n“CyberArk's acquisition of Venafi underscores the growing recognition of the critical role machine identities play in securing modern digital environments,” said Katie Norton, Research Manager, DevSecOps and Software Supply Chain Security at IDC. “While organizations have heavily invested in human identity security, the automation and management of credentials for machine identities has not historically received the same attention. Together, the companies' complementary capabilities should enable organizations to implement a more comprehensive machine identity security strategy, reducing risk and enhancing operational efficiency.” \n\nAll machine identities, including workloads, code, applications, IoT devices and containers, must be discovered, managed, secured and automated to keep their connections and communications safe. The combination of Venafi’s certificate lifecycle management, enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), workload identity management, secure code signing and SSH security with CyberArk’s secrets management capabilities, will empower organizations to protect against misuse and compromise of machine identities at scale. \n\n**Details Regarding the Acquisition**\n\nUnder the [terms of the agreement](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net%2FCIK-0001598110%2Fb7debfd6-62f1-44f2-bfd1-e63a7a385509.pdf&esheet=54129349&newsitemid=20240930990953&lan=en-US&anchor=terms+of+the+agreement&index=4&md5=f54cb41f5364d39705c60a470dd55158) , CyberArk acquired Venafi for approximately $1.54 billion in a combination of cash and CyberArk ordinary shares (approximately $1 billion in cash and approximately $540 million in ordinary shares). \n\n**Advisors**\n\nMorgan Stanley & Co.

The subscription portion of ARR excludes maintenance contracts related to perpetual licenses.\nMaintenance Portion of Annual Recurring Revenue\n• Maintenance portion of ARR is defined as the annualized value of active maintenance contracts related to perpetual licenses. The Maintenance portion\nof ARR excludes SaaS and self-hosted subscription contracts in effect at the end of the reported period.\nNet New ARR\n• Net new ARR refers to the difference between ARR as of September 30, 2024 and ARR as of June 30, 2024.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR), Subscription portion of ARR and Maintenance portion of ARR are performance indicators that provide more visibility into\nthe growth of our recurring business in the upcoming year. This visibility allows us to make informed decisions about our capital allocation and level of\ninvestment. Each of these measures should be viewed independently of revenues and total deferred revenue as each is an operating measure and is not intended\nto be combined with or to replace either of those measures. ARR, Subscription portion of ARR and Maintenance portion of ARR are not forecasts of future\nrevenues and can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCyberArk believes that the use of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income and free\ncash flow is helpful to our investors. These financial measures are not measures of the Company’s financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be\nconsidered as alternatives to gross profit, operating loss, net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities or any other performance measures\nderived in accordance with GAAP.\n• Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated as GAAP gross profit excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets related to\nacquisitions, and impairment of capitalized software development costs.\n• Non-GAAP operating expense is calculated as GAAP operating expenses excluding share-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses,\nand amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions.\n• Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is calculated as GAAP operating loss excluding share-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses,\namortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, and impairment of capitalized software development costs.\n• Non-GAAP net income is calculated as GAAP net (loss) excluding share-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses, amortization of\nintangible assets related to acquisitions, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, change in fair value of derivative assets, gain from\ninvestment in privately held companies, impairment of capitalized software development costs, and the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments.\n• Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less purchase of property and equipment.\nThe Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that are adjusted by, as applicable, share-based compensation expense, acquisition related\nexpenses, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance cost,\nchange in fair value of derivative assets, and the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments and purchase of property and equipment allows for more meaningful\ncomparisons of its period to period operating results. Share-based compensation expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a\nsignificant recurring expense in the Company’s business and an important part of the compensation provided to its employees. Share based compensation\nexpense has varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and a variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash\nexpense. The Company believes that expenses related to its acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, change in fair value of\nderivative assets, and non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs do not reflect the performance of its core\nbusiness and impact period-to-period comparability. The Company believes free cash flow is a liquidity measure that, after the purchase of property and\nequipment, provides useful information about the amount of cash generated by the business.\nNon-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as\nother companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. In addition, there are\nlimitations in using non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude expenses that may have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial results. The\npresentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures\nprepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. CyberArk urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable U.S.\nGAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nGuidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes, as applicable, share-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses, amortization of\nintangible assets related to acquisitions, non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, non-cash change in fair value\nof derivative assets, the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments, and purchase of property and equipment. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential\nvariability and significance of, the amounts of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, and the non-\nrecurring expenses that are excluded from the guidance, as well as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which impact other GAAP performance\nmetrics. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures for future periods is not available\nwithout unreasonable effort.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements, which express the current beliefs and expectations of CyberArk’s (the “Company”) management.
