In 2015 we set out\nour growth strategy – outlining how we are built for\nglobal growth and committed to creating value for\nour stakeholders across different economic cycles.\nToday, we continue to see that strategy through.\nFrom 3 offices in 1982 to where we are now, with\n480 employees from 50 nationalities, working from\n12 offices across 3 continents – Investcorp has\nnever been so dynamic, and so diversified in its\npeople and asset classes.\nToday, we are also committed more than ever\nto conducting responsible business. Our global\ninvestment teams remain focused on identifying\ncompelling opportunities, and as a business, we\ncontinue to position our firm as a global alternative\nasset manager of choice for both institutional\ninvestors and UHNW individuals.\n01 Message to Shareholders\n06 Business Review\n54 Corporate Governance, Balance Sheet and Risk Management\n76 Consolidated Financial Statements\n132 Senior Management\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nMESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS\nThe Board of Directors of Investcorp is pleased to submit the consolidated audited financial statements for\nInvestcorp’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nDear Shareholders,\nThis year marks Investcorp’s 40th anniversary or, in other words, four decades of enriching the lives of future\ngenerations and fostering close client and investor relationships. In the past twelve months, more than ever, the\nchallenges we faced as a firm and as an industry have required relentless adaptation and resilience. We have\ncontinued to make significant progress on a range of strategic initiatives to realize our medium- and longer-term\nobjectives of reaching US$50 billion and US$100 billion in AUM, respectively.\nWe would like to thank you all for your ongoing support, partnership, and trust in Investcorp as we continue to\nnavigate complex times. This past year has seen immense difficulties for people across the globe as geopolitical\ndevelopments jeopardized food and energy security for millions, if not billions, of people. These developments, in\naddition to the continuing global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in market disruptions, as well as\nextremely difficult operating conditions for business owners and investors.\nWe are incredibly proud of our steadfast resilience in difficult circumstances. During our 40-year history, we have\nexperienced and succeeded through many crises by staying resilient, prudently managing risks, and capturing\nopportunities. Naturally, this experience and pride is rooted in our people and our business partners who have made\nthis all possible.\nFinancial performance\nWe are pleased to report yet another strong year of growth for Investcorp. Our sights are firmly set on the continued\npursuit of long-term growth, as we respond to the evolving needs of our expanding and diversifying client base.\nOver the last year, we have continued to carefully diversify the business to offer a greater range of options for our\nclients than ever before – across both our suite of products and our global geographies. Despite rising inflation and\nongoing economic headwinds, during the past year the business delivered 14% growth in AUM and reached a record\nhigh of US$42.7 billion.\nThe results were driven by robust levels of activity across our core businesses of private equity, real estate, credit\nmanagement and absolute return investments. This resulted in delivering a net profit attributable to the equity holders\nof Investcorp’s parent company of US$135 million compared to US$124 million in FY21 and diluted earnings per\nshare of US$1.31 compared to US$1.34 per share in FY21.\nThis growth reflects the increasing demand for our products across our business lines and the trust that our clients\nand business partners place in us. We continue to carefully identify robust business models in the businesses that\nwe invest in, which when coupled with their strong leadership and management teams enable us to be confident\nsupporting them through times of growth or diversification. To maintain our forward-looking approach, we have\ncontinued to introduce innovations such as our blockchain fund. We also continued to further develop our ESG\n01\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\npolicies and commitments and look to drive value for the communities in which we invest, our employees, as well as\nfor our shareholders.\nTotal shareholders’ equity (excluding non-controlling interests) increased 3% to US$1,314 million, compared to the\npast financial year’s US$1,270 million and total assets were US$2,295 million – a decrease from US$2,391 million.\nThe FY22 recommendation for distribution of preferred and ordinary dividends is US$ 57 million in aggregate with\nthe proposed ordinary dividend being US$ 0.30 per share. In terms of fundraising, we have reached a record high of\nUS$7.4 billion raised across private and institutional clients for new deal-by-deal offerings, fund products and also by\nthe SPAC company IPOs that we sponsored, as well as the pricing/issuance and resets of several CLOs.\nWhile market challenges undoubtedly remain, with the ebbs and flows of the market creating volatility for investors\nand businesses alike, we are making strong progress against our Long-Term Range Plan goal of US$100 billion in\nAUM and continue to drive forward with a continuing focus on delivering sustainable growth across the business.\nStrategic expansion continued amidst challenging market conditions\nWe have continued to expand our geographical footprint across the globe. Successes in the United States includes the\nopening of our Los Angeles office and the launch of a private infrastructure investment business. Investcorp has also\ndelivered growth in the Asian markets, with our first India domestic fundraising, NDR Warehousing Private Limited.\nAdditionally, in the Middle East, we launched the Investcorp Saudi Pre-IPO Growth Fund.\nWe have also diversified our offering to better navigate an unstable market. In the last twelve months, we successfully\nsponsored two NASDAQ listed IPOs. Both SPAC IPOs were oversubscribed and generated gross proceeds of over\nUS$600 million in aggregate. We have been monitoring the environment to create new products in line with market\ntrends. We have launched the first dedicated institutional blockchain and Shariah-compliant fund based in the GCC –\nto maximize our reach and ensure that we are providing tailored products to match our investors’ needs. Furthermore,\nwe held the final close of the Investcorp Strategic Capital Partners Fund with capital commitments of US$620 million.\nMoreover, we have pursued several initiatives across business sectors, including the ‘Investcorp Insurance Solutions’\nplatform, our newly formed business line that will focus on providing investment management services to meet the\nunique investment needs of insurers. Another example of diversification efforts includes our recent joint venture with\nUnited Talent Agency which is focused on making growth investments at the intersection of Web 3.0 and the “creator\neconomy”.\nResponsible Business\nOver the last financial year, Investcorp has made significant progress in our Environmental, Social and Governance\n(ESG) and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) efforts, where we have sought to build a firmwide program that, at\nits heart, seeks to deliver better results for all our stakeholders.\nOur resolute commitment to environmental and social responsibility forms a core component of our strategy, values\nand culture. This is in part reflected by the significant additional time and resources that we have devoted to these\nefforts, adding two full time employees into the ESG team, reporting into the firm’s Head of ESG, to enhance our\nglobal ESG capabilities and ultimately nurture behaviors that facilitate responsible investment decisions, sustainable\nbusiness operations, and better employment practices.\nAs an investment manager, we believe that our greatest lever to create impact is through the investments we make.\nOur revised Responsible Investment policy, which was launched in 2021 as part of an overarching ESG policy\nframework, guides our entire investment process from deal screening through portfolio stewardship and exit. Core to\nour approach is ongoing engagement with the management teams of our underlying portfolio companies, to firstly\nhelp them gain a good understanding of the material ESG risks and opportunities that are relevant to them, and to\nsubsequently work with them to monitor and improve performance on the most material issues – we believe that this\napproach will sustainably unlock additional value over the course of our investment.\nWe are also looking inward at our own business and are actively taking steps to improve the ESG performance of\nInvestcorp as a company. For instance, this past year we conducted the firm’s first ever carbon footprint assessment\nto measure, monitor and mitigate our environmental impact, and will drive further improvements over the coming\nyear.\n02\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nEqually important is responsible employment practices, which is another core business imperative for Investcorp. We\nhave long believed that a diverse workforce is an essential ingredient to delivering strong performance and positive\neconomic development. Through our DE&I initiatives, we have continued to promote a more inclusive recruitment\nprocess and work environment, and we’re particularly proud of our 2021 Recruitment Policy, for instance, where we\nhave pledged that 50% of our shortlisted candidates must come from diverse backgrounds.\nWe are encouraged by the steps we have taken in the past year – building on the initiatives outlined in our inaugural\n2021 Responsible Business report – to create sustainable economic value for our investors and other stakeholders.\nAs we go into the new fiscal year, we will look to scale projects that are already under way and launch new value\nenhancing initiatives.\nInvestcorp is an institution built to last, operated by a diverse and multiskilled talent pool. We are confident in\nour ability to remain diligent in our approach towards responsible investing and to further challenge ourselves to\ncontinually improve. Naturally, this will always be a work in progress as a rigorous approach requires constant\nevaluation and measurement, in pursuit of our corporate purpose to sustainably enrich the lives of future generations.\nOutlook\nThe past few years have been tumultuous. We have seen volatility across economies, geopolitics, public health and\nsocieties across the world. It is undeniable that in these fluid conditions it is imperative for us to remain nimble and\nadaptive to overcome adversity. We recognize the ongoing challenges such as rising inflation, supply chain disruptions\nand the energy and commodity crises that are impacting countries around the world. We see some businesses and\nsocieties struggling – but we also see significant resilience and strength.\nWhilst the short-term macro-economic and geopolitical outlook remains uncertain, we are confident that our\nexceptional people and resilient business model will enable us to navigate challenges efficiently to reach our US$50\nbillion in AUM medium-term objective and our US$100 billion in AUM longer-term objective. As a business, we have\nweathered difficult market conditions in the past and we remain focused and ambitious in our growth strategy. As a\nresponsible investment manager, we will continue to seek opportunities to drive yield and returns for our investors. As\nan investor and strategic partner, we will continue to advise and support our portfolio companies.\nAs we enter the next financial year, we will continue to rely on our expertise and learnings, and carefully monitor the\nenvironment to identify challenges and opportunities - as well as continuously adapt our approach to business while\nstaying true to our values. We have embedded dynamism and entrepreneurial thinking across the firm and together,\nwith your support, we are confident in our ability to navigate the challenges to come and continue to thrive in the\nlong-term.\nDr. Yousef Hamad Al-Ebraheem Mohammed Mahfoodh Alardhi\nChairman of the Board of Directors Executive Chairman\n03\nIINNVVEESSTTCCOORRPP AANNNNUUAALL RREEPPOORRTT 22002222\nBUSINESS REVIEW\n044\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCONTENTS\n06 Business Review\n06 Message from the Executive Chairman\n06 Business Highlights\n22 Discussion of Results\n30 Assets Under Management\n33 Portfolio Review\nFigures throughout may not add up due to rounding.\n05\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nWe are delighted to report another strong year of growth for Investcorp, as we pursue our long-term growth strategy and\nrespond to the evolving needs of our growing and diversifying client base.\nOver the last year, we continued to diversify our business to offer a greater range of options for our clients than ever before\n– across both our suite of products and our global geographies.

The IHL Series A Preference Shares, the IHL Series B\nPreference Shares and the IHL Series E Preference Shares owned by Investcorp Holdings entitle it to 100% of the\neconomic interest in IHL and, therefore, 100% of the economic interest in the 98.4% of the book value of the\nInvestcorp Group’s consolidated assets owned directly and/or indirectly by ISA.\nUnder the Articles of Association of IHL, in the event of the occurrence of any event, or a series of events, of an\nadverse nature that are reasonably likely to materially impair Investcorp Holdings’ ability to perform its obligations,\ncause a change of control of Investcorp Holdings or prevent it from continuing normal business activities, the\nDesignated Representatives, who are certain of Investcorp Holdings’ senior executive officers and certain of\nInvestcorp Holdings’ Directors, have the power to declare that an ‘investment protection event’ has occurred.\nExamples of circumstances that would constitute an ‘investment protection event’ include the hostile invasion of\nBahrain by the forces of a foreign state, the nationalization of Investcorp Holdings or substantial interference in\nthe conduct of business that is reasonably likely to result in a material adverse change in the business, operations,\nassets or financial condition of Investcorp Holdings.\nShould the Designated Representatives declare that an investment protection event has occurred, the IHL Series A\nPreference Shares, the IHL Series B Preference Shares and the IHL Series E Preference shares held by Investcorp\nHoldings will be automatically redeemed for nominal consideration. If the investment protection event is not\ntemporary, IHL will issue shares and cause them to be delivered to the shareholders of Investcorp Holdings so that\neach shareholder will own shares directly in IHL that are economically equivalent in all respects to the shares that\nthey own in Investcorp Holdings.\n58\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nOverview\nInvestcorp views corporate governance as the manner in which members of the Board of Directors, shareholders,\ninvestors, management and employees of Investcorp are organized and how they operate in practice. Good corporate\ngovernance involves keeping business practice above reproach and thus retaining the trust and confidence of all the\nstakeholders who enable Investcorp to operate, thrive and prosper.\nInvestcorp makes large investments in mostly illiquid asset classes such as corporate and real estate investments.\nThrough its regulated subsidiaries in the various jurisdictions where it operates, it places a large proportion of these\ninvestments with clients and retains a portion for its own balance sheet. These investment activities operate with\nabove- average risk levels and have led to the development of a comprehensive risk management infrastructure and\nstrong corporate governance over the past 40 years. Investcorp’s corporate governance practices have been structured\naround the following three principles:\ni. alignment of interests among shareholders, clients and management combined with protection of lenders’ interests;\nii. transparency of reporting and actions plus proactive risk control; and\niii. collective decision-making.\nAt June 30, 2022, Investcorp Holdings’ corporate governance was subject to the Bahrain Ministry of Industry and\nCommerce Corporate Governance Code (‘Governance Code’). Please see the Fiscal Year 2022 Corporate Governance\nReport for disclosure regarding Investcorp’s compliance with the Governance Code.\ni. Alignment of interests. A central tenet of Investcorp’s philosophy is to ensure that interests among shareholders, clients\nand management are optimally aligned and that lender interests are well protected. The diagram below summarizes the\nkey factors that drive this alignment.\nGood alignment of interest between key stakeholders\nClients\n29.66% of company\nowned by a group of 55\nstrategic shareholders\nMost shareholders are also clients Management typically co-invests alongside clients\nthat are highly regarded\nBalance sheet co-invests alongside client Carry-based incentive compensation programs\nthroughout the Gulf and are\nstrong brand ambassadors\nof Investcorp\nIndependent board of directors\nManagement invests in shares through IIP Management has 27.86%\nShareholders Management beneficial ownership of company\nOwnership structure and Ownership structure and\ncreditor protection mechanism creditor protection mechanism\nLenders\n59\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE, BALANCE SHEET AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe alignment of interest is ensured by the following mechanisms:\nCo-investments: Clients of the Investcorp Group, shareholders and management all participate in each of Investcorp’s\ninvestment products. Investcorp retains a stake in each private equity, real estate and strategic capital transaction or\nfund, placing the balance with clients through its regulated subsidiaries in the various jurisdictions where it operates.\nInvestcorp also invests a portion of its assets in the products of the Investcorp Group’s credit management business\nand in the absolute return investment products of Investcorp-Tages Limited. Hence, through ownership of Investcorp,\nshareholders indirectly participate in each of the investment products.\nIn addition, some of Investcorp’s employees typically co-invest alongside the Investcorp Group clients and Investcorp in\nthese investment products. As a result, all three groups are collectively exposed to the same risks and share the same\noutcomes. This emphasis on co-investment ensures that all stakeholders are motivated to grow Investcorp and enhance\nits value through the generation of superior risk-adjusted returns in each of the Investcorp Group products.\nPerformance-based incentive compensation: In addition, consistent with industry practice, Investcorp’s investment\nprofessionals participate in performance-based investment carried interest programs whereby a certain variable portion\nof exit proceeds due to investors from the realization of their investments is shared with the investment professionals,\nprovided that a certain pre-established minimum client investment performance objective is satisfied on the underlying\ninvestment.\nIn addition, the overall compensation paid to members of senior management and other Investcorp executives is highly\ncorrelated with Investcorp’s net income. Investcorp’s net income is driven by its ability to acquire, place, manage and\nrealize investments and realize gains from investments on its balance sheet (franchise value). The franchise value, in\nturn, depends on management’s ability to provide long-term value to the Investcorp Group clients and shareholders and\nprotection for its creditors.\nFurthermore, all of Investcorp’s employees at the level of Vice President, Principal and Managing Director who are\nabove designated levels of remuneration are required to defer a percentage of their variable (incentive) remuneration\nand utilize a portion of that deferred remuneration to purchase indirect beneficial interests in Investcorp Holdings’\nOrdinary Shares through the ISOPs or into the Deferred Cash Program (‘DCP’). Both programs are subject to vesting\nrequirements.\nAdditionally, certain of Investcorp’s management and employees have been invited to participate in the ownership of\nindirect beneficial interests in Investcorp Holdings’ Ordinary Shares through the IIPs.\nIn this manner, Investcorp’s executive compensation and share participation programs play a critical role in aligning\nmanagement’s interests with the interests of shareholders, clients and lenders.\nThe aggregate amount of compensation paid to senior management in respect of Fiscal Year 2022, including variable\nremuneration that is required to be deferred and utilized to purchase indirect beneficial interests in Ordinary Shares\nthat are subject to vesting requirements, is disclosed in Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements of Investcorp\nHoldings.\nThe names of the members of Senior Management and information regarding their roles within Investcorp and their\nprofessional backgrounds is included in the Senior Management section of this Annual Report.\nFurther information regarding the Investcorp Group’s remuneration policies and practices is provided in the Fiscal Year\n2022 Corporate Governance Report.\nii. Transparency and risk control. Transparency at Investcorp involves the open and proactive discussion of issues\nand problems with all stakeholders. The role and nature of the Board of Directors and its Standing Committees and\nInvestcorp’s management structure are vital elements of an Investcorp Group-wide framework for mitigating risks,\nallocating resources and making decisions with full accountability based on all relevant information.\n60\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nBoard of Directors\nUnder the Articles of Association of Investcorp Holdings the Board of Directors consists of not less than five and not\nmore than 15 Directors, and the number of Directors is determined by shareholder resolution. Following the resignation\nof Mr. John Fraser on November 5, 2021, there are, as at June 30, 2022, 14 Directors.

Investcorp’s Finance group has oversight and responsibility for management of the balance sheet structure and\nimplements strategy and policies within a framework set by the Financial and Risk Management Committee (FRMC),\nunder the oversight of the Board of Directors’ Audit and Risk Committee and the Board of Directors.\nThis conservative approach to balance sheet management is a deliberate strategy to mitigate the impact of refinancing\nand liquidity risk on Investcorp’s core business model of originating and syndicating alternative asset investments, and\nits ongoing commitment to stakeholder alignment by way of co-investing its balance sheet alongside investors in all its\nproducts. It also seeks to mitigate the impact on the business from market liquidity stresses or forced refinancing of\ndebt facilities during sustained periods of economic difficulty. It therefore targets to finance its entire portfolio of illiquid\nco-investments with permanent capital (equity), long dated debt and also debt secured by such co-investments.\nRatings\nInvestcorp recognizes the value of an investment-grade rating and is aiming for that objective over the medium term.\nRating agencies and lenders profile Investcorp as non-Gulf based credit risk, given that almost all of the Group’s assets\nare held under Investcorp S.A., a non-Gulf entity. As a matter of course, certain debt covenants require that Investcorp\nSome of the key themes referred to by the rating agencies in their reports are:\nl strong client franchise with a high degree of brand name recognition and respect in the Gulf region;\nl diversification benefits inherent to the business model from an increasingly globalized distribution platform and the\nestablishment and growth of new business lines;\nl the strength and longevity of tenure of the management team; and\nl the conservative balance sheet management approach for liquidity, funding and capital.\nFollowing the global financial crisis in FY09, rating agencies have repeatedly pointed to Investcorp’s balance sheet\nrisk arising from co-investment activities as a significant source of potential earnings and leverage stress in extreme\nscenarios. Rating agencies have also highlighted the negative impact from the global spread of the coronavirus on\ninvestment valuations. Investcorp recognized these challenges by deleveraging and strengthening its balance sheet\nthrough risk reduction and capital raising measures to support an eventual return to an investment grade credit rating\nin the future.\nLiquidity management\nInvestcorp targets an adequate level of accessible liquidity to meet peak levels of underwriting activity, operational cash\nto cover near term operating expenses and interest payments; and contractual debt repayments. This is achieved by a\ncombination of on-balance sheet liquidity, held in the form of invested short tenor liquid assets and off-balance sheet\nliquidity in the form of committed medium-term revolving credit facilities provided by close relationship banks. Such\nfacilities are mainly used in the normal course of business for acquisition underwriting of new corporate investment or\nreal estate investment deals prior to placement with clients, which takes place after the deal is closed. Bank revolvers,\ntherefore, supplement core liquidity, and together they provide a pool of accessible liquidity to underwrite multiple\nacquisitions, without having to redeem or dispose of co-investments to meet short-term working capital requirements.\nThe credit environment, lender preferences and the reliability of interbank markets will dictate the actual mix between\noff- balance sheet and on-balance sheet liquidity that Investcorp chooses to hold at any particular time.\nInvestcorp stress tests its liquidity on a regular basis to ensure that it has sufficient cash in the near-term to meet\nunforeseen obligations. This worst-case stress scenario assumes the disappearance of almost all short-term funding\nsources; and a need to provide additional capital support to portfolio companies.\n70\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nFunding structure\nThe conservative approach to balance sheet structure is also applied to Investcorp’s funding activity. Investcorp’s\nstrategy is to maintain strong lender relationships, provide lenders with regular dialogue on business developments and\nfinancial results, and to be responsive on issues and questions that arise. A prudent approach to financial management\nhas led to a deliberate strategy to secure long- and medium-term funding from a geographically diverse lender base.\nInvestcorp has a positive structural funding gap where the average maturity of liabilities has consistently been longer\nthan the average maturity of its assets. This has been achieved from the traditional global medium-term club and\nsyndicated bank loan markets, together with capital markets transactions such as public bonds and private placements\nwith institutional investors.\nRefinancing requirements are managed to avoid maturity concentration in any given period, and the Company continually\nreviews opportunities to access new financing markets or sources with new funding products.\nInvestcorp’s medium-term funding therefore comprises committed bank facilities (drawn and revolving), an Islamic term\nloan, capital markets notes and bonds. When the financing environment permits, this pool is targeted to have staggered\nmaturities to reduce repayment or refinancing concentration and to match the medium-term nature of Investcorp’s\nworking capital cycle. Investcorp’s long-term funding comprises private placements with international insurers with\nresidual maturities of approximately 10 years.\nA combination of high liquidity and committed term funding with actively managed maturities aims to provide adequate\ncoverage, in a worst-case scenario, for all near- and medium-term debt repayments.\nLeverage\nConsistent with its overall conservative approach to balance sheet management, Investcorp aims to maintain a\nmoderate leverage ratio, using debt where appropriate and ensuring a sufficient amount of accessible liquidity for peak\nunderwriting of new acquisitions. The de-leveraging initiatives of the last few years have reduced leverage to 0.5x equity\nwith FY20 been impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.\nInvestcorp’s debt covenants contain a ‘leverage’ and a ‘net leverage’ calculation.\nLeverage is calculated as total liabilities (excluding temporary liabilities that are generally transient in nature)\ndivided by the equity capital base. The drawdown of revolving credit facilities to fund the underwriting of corporate\ninvestments and real estate investments before they are placed with clients temporarily inflates total liabilities.\nThese are self-liquidating on receipt of client funds and Investcorp does not count these temporary liabilities in its\nleverage calculations\nThe leverage calculation above reflects a very basic measure of financial risk. It does not give any benefit to the fact\nthat a proportion of borrowed money may be retained in the form of cash. Net leverage however calculates leverage\nas total liabilities less the sum of balance sheet cash, other liquid assets and funded underwriting.\nInvestcorp is comfortable with its leverage levels, given that a continuous and thorough analysis of risks on the balance\nsheet is used to determine and ensure capital adequacy under severely stressed scenarios.\nWhile Investcorp does manage its balance sheet with the leverage ratio in mind, it also focuses on risk capital, which is, in\nInvestcorp’s opinion, a more holistic measure of the risks on the balance sheet and is described in the following section on\nRisk Management. Investcorp aims to size its capital base so it can withstand a prolonged stressed environment as well as\nevent risks, while maintaining cash flow and liquidity, sufficient to cover interest and debt repayment obligations.\n71\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE, BALANCE SHEET AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nInvestcorp takes an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, and the proactive identification and mitigation of all\nembedded risks is an integral part of the corporate decision-making process.\nThe Asset and Liability Council (‘ALCO’) which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes the Head of Risk\nManagement and other senior members of Investcorp, assesses and reviews various balance sheet risks arising from\ntreasury activities on an on-going basis and decides on mitigation strategies for these risks. The ALCO is overseen by\nthe Financial and Risk Management Committee, which is the risk management oversight committee that evaluates\nall tactical actions proposed and undertaken to manage the balance sheet and attendant risks from the standpoint of\nInvestcorp’s business model, funding profile, liquidity position, capital base and on-going operations in line with the\nAudit and Risk Committee and Board approved risk policies manual. In addition, separate risk review forums are used\nfor each line of business to determine specific risks surrounding each new investment, and actions to be taken in an\neffort to mitigate these risks.\nTYPES OF RISK1\nInvestcorp groups its predominant risks under the following categories:\nl counterparty credit risk Note 22(i)*1;\nl credit risk measurement Note 22(ii)*;\nl funding liquidity risk Note 22(iii)*;\nl concentration risk Note 22(iv)*;\nl foreign currency risk Note 22(v)(a)*;\nl interest rate risk Note 22(v)(b)*;\nl equity price risk Note 22(v)(c)*; and\nl operational risk Note 22(vi)*.\nInvestcorp has developed tools in conjunction with leading risk management consultants to perform detailed risk\nanalysis, specifically addressing the investment and concentration risks of each individual line of business.\nCredit risk management\nInvestcorp faces credit risk primarily through the activities such as placement of liquidity with counterparties, fair\nvalue of derivatives and hedging contracts, client related receivables, loans and advances to corporate structures and\nemployee compensation program related receivables. Investcorp monitors credit exposures by classifying exposures,\nestablishing credit limits, triggering a review and corrective action in case of credit deviations, and continually assessing\nthe creditworthiness of counterparties. The details of credit exposures on the balance sheet at June 30, 2022 is shown\nin Note 22(i)* of the financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C (c).\nInterest rate/currency risk management\nAssets and liabilities give rise to interest rate risk if changes to the level of interest rates impact the value of future cash\nflows generated from assets or the value of future cash flows paid in respect of liabilities. The exposure of Investcorp’s\nbalance sheet to interest rate risk is frequently measured and monitored using risk management tools that provide in-\ndepth analysis across investment and funding sources. The amount of interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet at\nJune 30, 2022 is shown in Note 22(v)(b)* of the financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C (c).\n1 * References are to footnotes in the fiscal 2022 Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. (c) consolidated financial statements.\n72\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nInvestcorp’s management team maintains a strategic position, unchanged from prior years, that shareholders’ equity\nis best protected from interest rate risk in the long run by maintaining a floating rate funding strategy. Overlaying this\nstrategy, Investcorp uses a combination of interest rate derivatives in order to protect against large movements in\ninterest rates, while at the same time preserving the benefit of potential lower rates.\nInvestcorp does not take any material foreign exchange positions on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies\nother than US dollars. Investcorp systematically hedges significant non-dollar asset and liability exposures in the\nforward foreign exchange market or by using currency derivatives. The small amount of residual net foreign currency\nexposure is shown in Note 22(v)(a)* of the consolidated financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C (c).\nLine of business investment risks\nPrivate equity investment. Private equity investment risk is a significant component of the balance sheet and is,\ntherefore, a key focus of analysis for the risk management team. The investment risk that is particular to the mid-\ncap private equity investment – North America, Europe, Asia & India business is mitigated by a set of tools that are\nused at all stages of the investment process. At pre-acquisition, the risk management team works alongside the deal\nteam to implement risk analyses based on the target company’s business plan. This enables identification of how the\ntarget company might perform under various scenarios, focusing, where appropriate, on specific characteristics of the\ndeal. Sensitivity analysis and risk contribution of identified drivers to the main outcomes (EBITDA, IRR) are essential\nelements of the risk assessment. The analysis is performed in addition to the extensive due diligence undertaken by the\nprivate equity investment team and enables the measurement of the target company’s risk compared to previous deals\nundertaken by Investcorp, as well as the fit of the target company from a client portfolio and balance sheet retention\nperspective.\nAll investment proposals are scrutinized rigorously by the Investment Committee prior to final approval by the Investment\nCouncil.\nOnce a company is acquired, Investcorp takes a portfolio approach to evaluate the risk impact of the investment on\nthe balance sheet. The risk management team regularly performs such risk analyses to ascertain how the risks of\nthe portfolio change over time and how it relates to internal limits and guidelines. Individual underwriting and sector\nexposure limits are imposed in order to manage any concentration risks. Finally, when exiting a portfolio company,\nhedging strategies may be used to mitigate risks associated with the exit process and to protect the expected realization\nproceeds from downside risks.\nAs in Investcorp’s private equity investment – North America, Europe, Asia & India business, the investment objective\nin each of the technology and MENA funds is to achieve returns that justify the risk being taken. The higher risks of\ntechnology and MENA investing are alleviated through board level representation with appropriate minority protections.\nThroughout the investment cycle, there is a strong emphasis on due diligence and proactive post-investment management.\nAbsolute Return Investments. ARI multi-manager solutions’ portfolio risk is managed both from a market strategy and\nmanager selection perspective. The most prevalent market risks emanate from an unfavorable market environment\nor from strategy-specific risks such as illiquidity. Manager risks include style drift, underperformance, excessive risk\ntaking, fraud/valuation errors and legal/documentation errors. These risks are mitigated through manager due diligence\nand selection, diversification, use of separate accounts, monitoring, stress testing, transparency and control of leverage.\nThe availability of portfolio detail, including through pre-negotiated transparency with hedge funds managers, enables\na more complete risk analysis, as well as meaningful strategy-specific exposure and profit attribution analyses.\nThe risk management function monitors and analyses ARI portfolios independent of the investment team. Among the\nrisks monitored are basis risk, concentration risk, scenario risk and tail risk. The function also conducts analysis on\nstrategy and asset class, stress tests and historical scenarios, exposure by strategy, security type, sectors, regions and\ncounterparty exposure and liquidity.\nWhile investment in ARI is designed to have a low level of correlation to various markets, liquidity can temporarily\ndecrease during periods of extreme stress, and correlations between previously uncorrelated strategies may increase,\nas occurred during March 2020, last quarter of calendar year 2008 and occurred to a lesser extent during 2011. The\n73\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE, BALANCE SHEET AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nARI team is mindful of these risks and has incorporated specific actions in its asset allocation, monitoring guidelines\nand separate accounts in order to cushion or mitigate these risks during periods of extreme market volatility and stress.\nReal estate investment. Risk management strategies used for private equity investment are also employed to mitigate\nrisks associated with the acquisition and retention of real estate investments. The real estate investment team further\nmitigates specific risk in three ways:\nl concentration on high quality, income producing properties with high occupancy rates;\nl establishment of partnerships with regional professionals, providing access to local knowledge and reputation; and\nl use of capital structures aimed at protecting properties against the negative impact of interest rate and/or occupancy\nfluctuations.\nTo this end, the team monitors interest rate and occupancy sensitivities on each property, both prior to acquisition\nand during the ownership phase. This process serves to identify and assess conditions and levels that may cause the\nproperty to incur cash flow difficulties.\nThe team is proactive in managing properties that show signs of potential difficulties. Risk management tools are used\nat all stages of the real estate investment process from pre-acquisition through to realization. During pre-acquisition,\nthe risk management team works alongside the real estate investment team to implement a detailed risk analysis based\non the target investment’s financial projections. This allows identification of how the property might perform under\nvarious scenarios, focusing, where appropriate, on specific characteristics of the investment. In addition to this analysis,\nthe extensive due diligence undertaken by the real estate team allows Investcorp to gauge the target property’s risk\ncompared to previous deals undertaken, as well as to gauge the fit of the target property from both client portfolio and\nbalance sheet retention perspectives.\nOnce an investment is made, Investcorp takes a portfolio approach to evaluate the risk impact of the investment on\nthe balance sheet. The risk management team regularly performs such risk analyses to ascertain how the risks of the\nportfolio change over time and how they relate to internal investment exposure limits and guidelines.\nCredit management investment. The credit management line of business investment risk represents risks primarily\nassociated with collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and the underlying credit investment, managed by the investment\nteam.\nThe investment team follows investment policy guidelines to screen new investment opportunities and identify any\nactual or potentially material risk during the pre-investment due diligence phase. The investment team also checks for\ncompliance with applicable local and international laws and regulations and, where appropriate, relevant international\nstandards. The investment team monitors performance of underlying investments against agreed action plans, targets\nand timetables.\nRisk management systematically assesses and reports on fund exposures including rating actions, price movements,\nsector exposures and performance, as well as portfolio management actions.\nDuring the warehouse and risk retention phase, Investcorp takes a portfolio approach to evaluate the impact of the\ninvestment on the balance sheet to continually assess the exposures relative to the internal investment exposure limits\nand guidelines. Risk management runs multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for prepayments, defaults\nand recoveries to assess how the portfolio would behave under different market cycles. The impact on cash flows from\nratings downgrade and default of specific loans is also assessed to measure the downside risk in the portfolio.\nOperational risk management\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or\nfrom external events (such as natural disasters, changes in regulation or outsourcing of operations). Investcorp includes\nin this definition legal risk but excludes reputational and strategic risks.\n74\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nWhile operational risks cannot be entirely eliminated, they are managed and mitigated by ensuring that appropriate\ninfrastructure, controls, systems, procedures and trained and competent people are in place throughout Investcorp.\nInternal audit makes regular, independent appraisals of the control environment in all identified risk areas. Contingency\narrangements, which are tested from time to time, are also in place to support operations in the event of a range of\npossible disaster scenarios. In addition, Investcorp carries ‘Errors and Omissions’ insurance against the legal risks\narising from its business.\nThe operational risk management framework adapted by Investcorp consists of the following: 1) ‘Risk Control and\nSelf-Assessment’: Self- assess operational risks by going through key business processes end-to-end, 2) Evaluate the\nadequacy of existing process controls, 3) Implement control modifications to reduce operational risks and determine\nresidual risks and 4) Monitor and report operational risk events to senior management.\nMaterial operational risks are escalated and reviewed by senior management via a formal governance process. This\nincludes documenting of root cause analysis of risk events and associated control remediation actions.\nAn inventory of risk events is maintained which facilitates a “look-across” of historical events aimed at identifying\npotential thematic issues – this process enables Investcorp to minimize the risk of repeated control issues.\nAdequacy of capital\nInvestcorp uses an enterprise VaR-like approach to determine capital adequacy for the combination of all balance sheet\nrisks, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to facilitate future growth plans and protect against periods of prolonged\nand extreme stress in the company’s operating environment, execution or performance.\nInvestcorp uses a risk-based capital allocation approach as the main tool to manage capital adequacy. Over the years,\nInvestcorp has been continuously assessing its capital adequacy methodology to take into account any increased risk\npremium, volatility and correlation for all asset classes. In designing the risk capital methodology, Investcorp strives\nto maintain a risk capital allocation that is independent of any specific market recovery expectations, accounting rule\nchanges and correlation assumptions. Investcorp continues to use the conservative assumption of 100% correlation\nbetween asset classes to provide an embedded cushion for protection against model risk inherent in model choice,\nmodel parameters estimation and model errors. Most importantly, the correlation constraint allows for an embedded\ncushion that will be counter-cyclical, since it is set for crisis like situations when asset correlation goes to one. Investcorp\nalso applies the requirement to establish an explicit equity capital surplus (equal to total book equity capital including\ndeferred fees minus total capital charges) that is set and monitored by ALCO. The capital surplus covers new business\ninitiatives, residual non-legal operational risk and market tail-risk stress events and provides for a buffer against potential\nexposures, as opposed to already capitalized existing exposures, under normal and stressed market conditions. Reviews\nof these risks and the adequacy of the capital allocation model and equity capital surplus are conducted on a regular\nbasis. The risk management team applies back-testing and stress-testing methodologies to continually assess the\nadequacy of the capital allocation model for each business line.\nThis approach to capital adequacy takes into account the illiquid nature of the underlying portfolios of private equity,\ncredit and real estate co-investments and, where possible, models other non-investment assets using a collateral\nbased VaR like model. The capital allocation is the linear sum of independently assessed risk capital charges for each\ninvestment asset, non-investment assets (receivables, advances, etc.) and the positive impact of any tail risk hedging\nstrategies executed for the Investcorp balance sheet.\n75\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nInvestcorp Holdings B.S.C.

(CLOSED)\nREPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOpinion\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. (closed) (“the Company”) and\nits subsidiaries (together “the Group”), which comprise of the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30\nJune 2022, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of other comprehensive income,\nconsolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes\nto the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated\nfinancial position of the Group as at 30 June 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows\nfor the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).\nBasis of Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those\nstandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nsection of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for\nAccountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards)\n(IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements\nin the Kingdom of Bahrain, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements\nand the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis\nfor our opinion.\nOther Information Included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report\nOther information consists of the information included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report, other than the consolidated\nfinancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. Prior\nto the date of this auditor’s report, we have obtained the following sections of the Group’s 2022 Annual Report, and the\nremaining sections are expected to be made available to us after that date.\n• Report of the Board of Directors;\n• Business Highlights;\n• Discussion of Results;\n• Assets Under Management; and\n• Portfolio Review\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form\nof assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information\nidentified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated\nfinancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on\nthe work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of the auditor’s report, we conclude that\nthere is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report\nin this regard.\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements\nin accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the\npreparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis\nof accounting unless Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic\nalternative but to do so.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs\nwill always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered\n78\nCONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS:\nINVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS\nB.S.C.\n(C)\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users\ntaken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism\nthroughout the audit. We also:\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud\nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient\nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from\nfraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate\nin the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related\ndisclosures made by the Board of Directors.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast\nsignificant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty\nexists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit\nevidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to\ncease to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the\ndisclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a\nmanner that achieves fair presentation.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities\nwithin the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,\nsupervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with the Audit and Risk Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the\naudit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\nWe report that:\na) as required by the Bahrain Commercial Companies Law,\nI. the Company has maintained proper accounting records and the consolidated financial statements are in agreement\ntherewith;\nII. the financial information contained in the Report of the Board of Directors is consistent with the consolidated\nfinancial statements; and\nIII. satisfactory explanations and information have been provided to us by management in response to all our requests.\nb) we are not aware of any violations of the Bahrain Commercial Companies Law or the terms of the Company’s\nmemorandum and articles of association during the year ended 30 June 2022 that might have had a material adverse\neffect on the business of the Company or on its consolidated financial position.\nc) as required by Article 8 of section 2 of chapter 1 of the Bahrain Corporate Governance Code, we report that the\nCompany:\nI. has appointed a Corporate Governance Officer; and\nII. has a board approved written guidance and procedures for corporate governance.\nPartner’s Registration No. 117\n30 July 2022\nManama, Kingdom of Bahrain\n79\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C.

An\nexample of a material event would be where a sale is imminent and credible bids have been received from third parties or\nvaluations have been received from banks engaged in the sale process. In these cases, the fair value would be established\nwith reference to the range of bids received and based on management’s assessment of the most likely realization value\nwithin that range. Another example of a material event would be where an arm’s length financing transaction has occurred\nrecently that is (a) material in nature, (b) involves third parties, and (c) attaches an implicit value to the company. In the\nevent that such a recent third-party measure of specific fair value for an individual investment is not available, the fair\nvalue is determined by using a multiples-based approach applied to the most recent and relevant operating performance\nmetric of the underlying company, typically EBITDA and sometimes sales. The multiple used is taken from a universe of\ncomparable publicly listed companies, recent M&A transactions involving comparable companies, and Discounted Cash\nFlow (“DCF”) analysis.\nManagement exercises its judgment in choosing the most appropriate multiple, on a consistent basis, from within the\nuniverse referred to above.\nOf the above, co-investments amounting to $35.1 million (June 30, 2021: $32.2 million) are classified as FVOCI\ninvestments.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Group’s management classifies hedges into two categories: (a) fair value hedges that hedge exposure to changes in\nfair value of a recognized asset or liability; and (b) cash flow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that\nis attributable to a particular risk associated with either a recognized asset or liability or a forecasted transaction highly\nprobable to occur.\nOther derivatives\nThe Group does not actively engage in proprietary trading activities in derivatives. However, on occasion, the Group may\nneed to undertake certain derivative transactions to mitigate economic risks under its asset-liability management and risk\nmanagement guidelines that may not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 (e.g. hedging of foreign currency risk on\nfair valued investments). Consequently, gains or losses resulting from the re-measurement to fair value of these derivatives\nare taken to the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nValuation of derivatives\nThe Group values the majority of its derivative financial instruments using internal models. The models use market\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies. Derivative assets and\nliabilities included in Level 2 (see Note 23) represent interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, currency forwards and\noption contracts. For derivatives that are not valued using internal models, the Group’s policy is to rely on third party\nvaluations, whilst benchmarking them against observable market data.\nThe Group’s outstanding derivative financial instruments comprise the following:\n2022 2021\nNotional Positive fair Negative fair Notional Positive fair Negative fair\nvalue value* value value value* value\nA) Derivatives Where Hedge\nAccounting Is Applied\nCurrency risk being hedged using\nforward foreign exchange contracts\ni) Fair value hedges\nOn balance sheet exposures 290 – (33) 338 – (7)\nii) Cash flow hedges\nForecasted transactions 29 2 (0) 33 1 (0)\nCoupon on long-term debt 45 – (5) 42 – (1)\nTotal forward foreign exchange contracts 364 2 (38) 413 1 (8)\nInterest rate risk being hedged using\ninterest rate swaps\ni) Fair value hedges - fixed rate debt 332 41 (1) 397 25 –\nii) Cash flow hedges - floating rate debt 25 – (0) 25 – (3)\nTotal interest rate hedging contracts 357 41 (1) 422 25 (3)\nTotal hedging derivatives 721 43 (39) 835 26 (11)\nB) Derivatives Where Hedge\nAccounting Is Not Applied\nInterest rate swaps 225 6 (8) 475 14 (12)\nForward rate agreements 17 0 (0) 4 0 (0)\nForward foreign exchange contracts 1,418 17 (11) 1,453 6 (4)\nCurrency options 12 0 – 43 – (3)\nFutures 17 0 – 16 – (0)\nTotal other derivatives 1,689 23 (19) 1,991 20 (19)\nTotal - Derivative Financial Instruments 2,410 66 (58) 2,826 46 (30)\n* Net collateral received by the Group amounting to $2 million has been taken against the fair values above (2021: $48.9 million).\n105\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C.

(CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nFurther, a tax query has been raised in relation to certain co-investments of the Group. The Group does not expect any\nlikely claim to arise in respect of this matter. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk management is an integral part of the Group’s corporate decision-making process. The Financial and Risk\nManagement Committee (FRMC) oversees the Group’s risk management activities, and sets the Group’s risk profile on an\nenterprise wide basis. The FRMC is comprised of members of senior management drawn from all key areas of the Group.\nThe Group’s primary risk management objective is to support its business objectives with sufficient economic capital.\nThe Group employs risk models to determine the capital needed to cover unexpected losses from investment or other\nrisks. This capital amount is known as economic capital. The economic capital requirement for each reporting segment\nis determined for a one year horizon and subsequently aggregated to determine the total economic capital. This total\neconomic capital is then stress tested under a dynamic VaR approach. The dynamic VaR is calculated by using a five-\nyear planning horizon, a 99% one-tailed confidence level and by recognizing diversification benefits across asset classes.\nIn addition to determining an adequate economic capital allocation for each reporting segment, the risk management\nteam has developed tools in conjunction with risk management consultants to perform detailed risk analyses that\nspecifically address the investment risks in each individual line of business.\nThe principal risks associated with the Group’s business, and the related risk management processes are explained\nbelow:\n(i) Counterparty credit risk\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on its short term funds, placements, fair value of derivatives,\nreceivables, advances, debt investments and guarantees. The Group manages counterparty credit risk by setting limits\nfor all counterparties. The Group also monitors credit exposures, and continually assesses the creditworthiness of\ncounterparties. Counterparty credit risk in respect of derivative financial instruments is limited to those with positive\nfair values. With respect to the counterparty credit risk exposure arising from other financial assets, the Group has\na maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments. The Group also actively attempts to mitigate\ncounterparty credit risks, where possible, through documented netting and margin arrangements with counterparties,\nunder ISDA and CSA agreements.\nThe risk management team maintains an overall external rating-based methodology for setting Board approved\ncounterparty limits. For rated counterparties, credit ratings from at least two rating agencies are used for developing\ncounterparty limits. All non-rated counterparties are screened through due diligence and credit analysis prior to the\nassumption of credit exposures to them by Investcorp.

(CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nSecuritization\nThe Group provides fund management services to funds which invest in CLOs and funds which provide syndicated\nlending to a variety of institutions. The Group also acts as an originator and sponsor for certain CLO investments and\nco-invests through specific SPVs in the CLO investments. The CLO investments are held within a business model whose\nobjective is to hold and sell assets in order to collect contractual cash flows on specified dates. The contractual terms\ngive rise to variable distributions (solely payments of principal and interest) based on CLO’s respective waterfall and\npriorities of payment. The Group manages its risk relevant to the securitization activity in line with its risk management\npolicies and procedures.\nThe Group’s securitization exposures through the CLOs are in the rated and unrated tranches of the notes and varies\nfrom fund to fund. The Group does not hold securitization positions with trading intent or to hedge positions with trading\nintent. The Group has not established and does not manage any synthetic securitization structures nor does it securitize\nrevolving exposures.\n(ii) Credit Risk Measurement\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nWhen determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial\nrecognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue\ncost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical\nexperience, expert credit assessment and forward-looking information.\nAs a practical expedient, IFRS 9 provides a low credit risk (‘LCR’) operational simplification that if a financial instrument\nhas low credit risk i.e. an investment grade credit rating, an entity is allowed to assume at the reporting date that no\nsignificant increase in credit risk has occurred.\nThe Group considers financial instruments with an external rating grade of ‘investment grade’ as LCR for the short-term\nliquid asset portfolio.\nThe receivables and advances of the Group are collateralized by the underlying investments. Hence, the Group considers\nfair-value movements of such investments and management judgement to assess whether there has been a significant\nincrease in credit risk for its receivables and advances portfolio.\nMeasurement of ECL\nThe Group measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default\n(LGD). PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation. EAD is based on the amounts\nthe Group expects to be owed at the time of default. LGD represents the group’s expectation of the extent of loss on\nthe exposure.\nFor the short-term liquid asset portfolio, external rating agency credit grades are used. These published grades are\ncontinuously monitored and updated. The PDs associated with each grade are determined based on realized default\nrates over the period of 12 months, as published by the rating agencies, after adjusting for forward-looking macro-\neconomic information.\nFor receivables and advances that arise in connection with the PE asset class, PDs are derived using an internal model\nand adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic information. PDs for receivables and advances of the RE asset class\nare derived based on internal categorization of the related investment and default rates published by a reputable rating\nagency adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic information.\nFor secured assets, LGDs are determined based on factors which impact the recoveries made post default. For unsecured\nassets, LGDs are based on regulatory guidelines.\nThe Group writes-off exposures if there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n110\nCONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS:\nINVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS\nB.S.C.\n(C)\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n(iii) Funding liquidity risk\nFunding liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to fund increases in assets and meet obligations when\nthey fall due, without incurring unacceptable losses. To mitigate this risk, the Group implements a comprehensive\nliquidity risk management framework, which includes the use of risk limits, monitoring systems and scenario analyses\nthat are incorporated into a contingency funding plan. The framework is subject to Board and senior management\noversight. Liquidity management aims to arrange diversified funding sources and maintain comfortable and laddered\ndebt maturities.

Investcorp includes\nin this definition legal risk but excludes reputational and strategic risks.\nWhile operational risks cannot be entirely eliminated, they are managed and mitigated by ensuring that appropriate\ninfrastructure, controls, systems, procedures and trained and competent people are in place throughout Investcorp. The\ninternal audit department makes regular, independent appraisals of the control environment in all identified risk areas.\nContingency arrangements, which are tested from time to time, are also in place to support operations in the event of\na range of possible disaster scenarios. In addition, Investcorp carries errors and omissions insurance against legal risks\narising from its business activities.\nInvestcorp applies the Basic Indicator Approach (‘BIA’) to measure operational risk and also is implementing a Board\nof Directors approved operational risk management framework. Under the BIA approach, the operational risk charge\nis calculated by taking Investcorp’s average gross income over the preceding two years and current financial year and\nmultiplying it by a fixed alpha coefficient (15 per cent). The operational risk management framework consists of the\nfollowing: 1) “Risk Control and Self-Assessment”: Self-assess operational risks by going through key business processes\nend-to-end, 2) Evaluate the adequacy of existing process controls, 3) Implement control modifications to reduce operational\nrisks and determine residual risks and 4) Monitor and report operational risk events to senior management and the Board.\n118\nCONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS:\nINVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS\nB.S.C.\n(C)\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the\ntransaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or\n• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing\nthe asset or liability, on the basis that market participants act in their economic best interest.\nThe Group has established guidelines for the valuation of its investments which are reviewed by the Board of Directors\nand abides by guidelines issued under IFRS on valuation of investments and guidelines recommended by the International\nPrivate Equity and Venture Capital Association. The Group performs valuations of its investments on a quarterly basis.\nThe business support teams work along with deal teams to prepare valuation packages in accordance with the valuation\nguidelines of the Group. The valuation packages are then presented to the Valuation Committee which is comprised of\nsenior members of the Finance team and investing lines of business. The Valuation Committee has the final responsibility\nof reviewing and approving the fair value of all investments.\nUnderlying the definition of fair value is the presumption that the Group is a going concern without any intention or\nrequirement to curtail materially the scale of its operations or to undertake a transaction on adverse terms.\nFair value adjustments arise from re-measurement of liabilities which are hedged, investments and derivatives.\nNonetheless the actual amount that is realized in a future transaction may differ from the current estimate of fair value,\ngiven the inherent uncertainty surrounding valuations of unquoted investments.\nThe fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values except\nfor certain assets and liabilities carried at amortized cost. The fair value of CLO co-investments carried at amortized cost\namounts to $101.1 million (June 30, 2021: $145.6 million) as compared to the carrying value of $101.9 million (June\n30, 2021: $145.3 million). The fair value of CLO co-investments is based on inputs from independent third parties and\nfalls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy disclosure. The fair value of medium and long term debt amounts to $350\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $414.8 million) as compared to the carrying value of $359.5 million (June 30, 2021: $417.4\nmillion). The fair value of medium and long term debt is based on inputs from third party banks and falls under Level 3\nof the fair value hierarchy described below.\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:\nLevel 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or\nindirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\nLevel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).\nDuring the current financial year, there was no transfer between levels (June 30, 2021: $6.9 million). Under absolute return\ninvestments, an exposure of $4 million (June 30, 2021: $5.3 million) is comprised of illiquid side pocket investments\nwhich are classified as Level 3. The year to date fair value changes on this ARI exposure amounts to a loss of $0.3 million\n(June 30, 2021: gain of $0.6 million) and the net redemptions amount to $0.9 million (June 30, 2021: $1 million).\nThe fair values of financial assets that are traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price\nquotations. For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation techniques which\nare explained in Notes 10 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\n119\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION\nInvestcorp has a clear and well-defined “pay for risk-adjusted long-term performance” philosophy that pervades its culture\nand motivates its employees to target delivery of consistent top-quartile performance. This philosophy is exhibited in\nInvestcorp’s remuneration programs and it is reflected in its annual remuneration decisions.\nThe remuneration that is paid to Investcorp’s employees is divided into two fundamental components: (i) fixed remuneration,\ni.e., salary and benefits, and (ii) variable remuneration.\nVariable remuneration, comprised of cash and awards under deferred remuneration programs, is remuneration that varies\nfrom year to year and the amount of which is dependent upon (i) the financial performance of Investcorp as a whole, (ii)\nthe risk-adjusted performance of each employee’s respective line of business and (iii) the performance of the individual\nemployee.\n121\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nInvestcorp extensively utilizes deferred remuneration programs as part of employees’ remuneration. These programs are\ncomprised of investment carried interest and co-investment programs and share-linked programs as described briefly\nbelow.\nPrograms for Investment Profit Participation\nThe Group’s investment professionals in its private equity investment, real estate investment and investment relationship\nmanagement lines of business participate in investment carried interest programs, whereby a certain variable portion of\nexit proceeds due to investors from realization of their investments is shared with these professionals, provided certain pre-\nestablished minimum client return hurdles are satisfied. Netting mechanisms are used so that returns from investments\nthat perform well are netted against other investments in which losses are sustained. Since this carry is awarded up front\nat the time of acquisition it has no significant value at the time of the award.\nPrograms for Investment Participation\nInvestment professionals and relationship managers also participate in a co-investment program pursuant to which\nthey acquire an interest in the Investcorp Group’s investments that they manage at the Investcorp Group’s Consolidated\nStatement of Financial Position carrying value, thereby resulting in no gain or loss to Investcorp except for any potential\nimpairment losses on the financing provided.\nUnder certain legacy co-investment programs, the Group provided financing at market rates to or on behalf of eligible\nemployees, to invest in these programs on a levered basis. The permissible levels of leverage varied on a product to\nproduct and program to program basis. The aggregate remaining amount of such financing provided to or on behalf of\nemployees as of June 30, 2022 is $1.5 million (June 30, 2021: $2.3 million).\nA portion of the deferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is also in the form of co-investment exposures.\nThese awards have different vesting conditions and are not transferable. An expense charge of $8 million (2021: $10\nmillion) was taken by the Group based on management’s best estimate of the likely vesting of the awards.\nEmployee Share-Linked Plans\nSHL sponsors various employee share-linked plans under which a portion of the deferred remuneration awarded to eligible\nemployees is in the form of SIPCO shares or phantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based awards that\nrepresent a beneficial interest in the ordinary shares of the Company. These SIPCO awards have different vesting periods\nand are not transferable.\nSIPCO shares or phantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based awards are granted to the employees\nat their fair value on the grant date. The fair value of SIPCO shares for purposes of the plans is estimated considering\ntheir non-transferability and the indirect nature of the underlying beneficial ownership. The value of SIPCO shares granted\nduring the year is $21.3 million (2021: $30.2 million). The start and end date of the vesting period for each grant varies\nfrom plan to plan and is based on continued employment (unless employment is terminated due to death, disability or\nretirement) as well as satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The determination of the amount of expense to be\nrecognized as compensation expense in any year is estimated based on a model that takes into account the probability\nweighted vesting of the shares at the fair value on the grant date using the historical pattern of employee tenure. These\nestimates are updated regularly based on actual information.\nAn expense charge of $18.4 million (2021: $16.2 million) was taken by the Group based on management’s best estimate\nof the number of shares that are likely to vest. The grant date value of shares vested during the year amounted to $20.9\nmillion (2021: $19 million). The details of shares granted, vested and forfeited during the year are as follows:\nNumber of shares 2022 2021\nGranted during the year 1,975,194 3,005,251\nVested during the year 1,927,757 1,740,240\nForfeited during the year 148,875 158,164\nThe fair value of shares granted during the year amounted to $21.3 million (2021: $30.2 million). The fair value of shares\nforfeited during the year amounted to $1.6 million (2021: $1.7 million).\n122\nCONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS:\nINVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS\nB.S.C.\n(C)\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n25. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\nFor the Group, related parties include its investee companies, companies that hold clients’ investments (investment\nholding companies), client fund companies associated with ARI, SIPCO Limited and the Trusts.\nIt also includes major shareholders, directors and senior management of the Company, their immediate families and\nentities controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by such parties. Income is earned or expense is incurred in\nthe Group’s transactions with such related parties in the ordinary course of business. The Group’s management approves\nthe terms and conditions of all related party transactions.\nAlthough these companies are classified as related parties, the Group administers and manages the companies that hold\nclients’ investments on a fiduciary basis on behalf of its clients who are third parties and are the beneficiaries of a majority\nof the economic interest from the underlying investments of these companies. As a result, the true nature of the Group’s\ntransactions with these companies is effectively at commercial terms as specified under pre-determined management\nagreements.\nIn addition to the compensation and benefits to employees disclosed in Note 24, the income earned and expenses\nincurred in connection with related party transactions included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:\n$millions 2022 2021\nAUM fees Investee and investment holding companies 186 159\nDeal fees Investee and investment holding companies 145 104\nAsset based income Investee companies 26 26\nInterest income Treasury and other income 2 1\nInterest expense Short term financing (3) (3)\nOperating expenses Directors' remuneration (2) (2)\nOf the staff compensation set out in Note 24, $110 million (2021: $87 million) is attributable to senior management.\nOf the above mentioned remuneration of senior management, $82.6 million (2021: $64.3 million) is in the form of\nsalaries and other short term benefits.\nIn addition to the compensation and benefits to employees disclosed in Note 24, the balances with related parties\nincluded in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nJune 30, 2022 June 30, 2021\nOff-balance Off-balance\n$millions Assets Liabilities sheet Assets Liabilities sheet\nOutstanding balances\nCo-investments 899 – – 668 – –\nUnderwritten and warehoused investments 370 – – 445 – –\nInvestment in joint ventures 13 – – 8 – –\nStrategic shareholders* 2 – – 13 – –\nInvestee companies* 67 0 30 60 2 –\nInvestment holding companies* 148 0 208 185 1 187\nFinancing – – – – 174 –\nDirectors and senior management* 107 – – 85 8 –\n1,606 0 238 1,464 185 187\n* Included in receivables and prepayments, advances and payables and accrued expenses.\n123\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards (“IFRS”), in conformity with the Bahrain Commercial Companies Law.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in United States dollars, this being the functional\ncurrency of the Group, and rounded to the nearest millions ($millions) unless otherwise stated. Certain prior year balances\nhave been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the net loss\nor equity of the Group.\nThe Group has adopted the below listed amendments to standards effective from July 1, 2021. The adoption of these\namendments did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n• Amendments to IFRS 4, IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 39 – Phase 2 of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform.\nWhile some of the Group’s financial instruments are subject to IBOR reforms at 30 June 2022 and have not yet\ntransitioned out of the current IBOR to ARR, the Group has already made substantial progress to finalize the transition\nfrom IBOR to the new ARR. Several milestones have been completed, such as the upgrade of the technology systems\nto handle the new reference rate, review of significant the Group’s internal documents and planning to amend\ndocumentation for existing contracts such as the existing Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group expects to have the full\ntransition implemented by June 2023.\nNew standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective\n• Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (issued May 2020, effective for annual periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments to IAS 16 - Proceeds before Intended Use (issued May 2020, effective for annual periods beginning on\nor after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract (issued May 2020, effective for annual\nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 - 2020 - effective for annual periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2022;\n• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued May 2017; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023);\n• Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (issued January 2020; effective for\nannual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023);\n• Amendments to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued February 2021; effective for annual period beginning\non or after 1 January 2023); and\n• Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of Accounting Policies (issued February 2021;\neffective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2023).\nThe Group’s management is currently evaluating the impact of the above standard and amendments on the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\ni) Accounting convention\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the re-measurement at\nfair value of financial instruments under IFRS 9 and revaluation of premises and equipment.\nii) Going concern\nThe Group’s management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that the\nGroup has sufficient resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware\nof any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nTherefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.\n124\nCONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS:\nINVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS\nB.S.C.\n(C)\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\niii) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are comprised of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. A\nsubsidiary is an entity which is controlled by the Group. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights\nto, variable returns through its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through its power\nover the entity. The Group consolidates its subsidiaries excluding entities which meet the below criteria:\na) Where there are contractual or other restrictions imposed on the Group’s ability to appoint the majority of the Board\nof Directors, or\nb) Where a majority of the economic risk and reward accrues to third parties other than the Group, or\nc) Where the exception to consolidate subsidiaries of an Investment entity is applied, as defined in IFRS 10.\nThe Group qualifies as an investment entity as defined under IFRS 10, and as such, measures its investments in accordance\nwith the requirements set out in the standard.\nThe results of all subsidiaries are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss from the effective date of\nformation or acquisition. The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting\nyear as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances, income and expenses have been\neliminated on consolidation.\niv) Business Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the\naggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair value. Acquisition-related costs are\nexpensed as incurred.\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification\nand designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the\nacquisition date.\nv) Trade date accounting\nPurchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery of the assets within a timeframe generally established by\nregulation or convention in the market place are recognized using the “trade date” accounting basis (i.e. the date that the\nentity commits to purchase or sell the asset).\nvi) Offsetting\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statement of\nfinancial position only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and the Group intends\nto settle on a net basis.\nvii) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amount of financial assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates\nis principally limited to:\na) The determination of the fair values of FVTPL investments in private equity co-investments, credit management co-\ninvestments, strategic capital co-investments, real estate co-investments, other strategic investments (see Note 10),\nand investment in SPACs (Note 9), the determination of performance fees on assets under management, impairment\nprovisions for financial assets other than FVTPL investments and FVOCI equity investments (see Note 13) and\nallocation of placement fee to the performance obligations as described later.\nb) The determination of performance fees on assets under management are dependent on the performance of the\nunderlying investments and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Group’s influence\nc) The determination of cash flows which is the basis for performing the assessment of solely payments of principal and\ninterest test on CLO co-investments which are being carried as debt instruments at amortized cost (see Note 10).\n125\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made judgments covered in the following\nsection, apart from those involving estimates, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe valuation approach was substantially consistent with our normal process and valuation policy. A key focus of the\nportfolio fair value was an assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each investment. The approach\nconsidered the performance of each investment exposure before the outbreak of COVID-19, the projected short-term\nimpact on their ability to generate earnings and cash flow and also longer-term view of their ability to recover and perform\nagainst their investment cases. Given the diversity of the portfolio, the impact has been varied, based on type of underlying\nexposure, industry exposure, expected recovery from the current crisis and current market inputs.\n(viii) Foreign currencies\nA foreign currency transaction is recorded in the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the value date\nof the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are held at the reporting date are retranslated\nat market rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss under treasury and other income.\nNon-monetary assets that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are recorded at rates of exchange\nprevailing at the value dates of the transactions. Non-monetary assets in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are\nretranslated at exchange rates prevailing on the dates the fair values were determined. Gains and losses on fair valuation\nof FVTPL investments are taken to the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nForeign currency differences arising from the translation of investments in respect of which an election has been made\nto present subsequent changes in FVOCI are recognized in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.\n(ix) Income\nInterest income is recognized using the effective yield of the asset and is recorded as asset based income. Asset based\nincome from all co-investments classified as FVTPL investments is recognized on the basis of realized and unrealized\nchanges in fair value as at the end of the reporting period.\nFee income is recognized when services are rendered. Performance fees are recognized when earned. Performance fees\nare only recognized once it is highly probable that there would be no significant reversal of any accumulated revenue in\nthe future. Estimates are needed to assess the risk that achieved earnings may be reversed before realization due to the\nrisk of lower future overall performance of the underlying investments. The reversal risk is managed through adjustments\nof the unrealized investment values by imposing discounts depending on specific investment risks and on the expected\naverage remaining holding period of the investment.\nIncome from SPAC transactions is recorded on the basis of realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of interest\nheld in the respective SPACs and is included within transaction and advisory income in the consolidated statement of\nprofit or loss.\nRealized capital gains or losses on FVOCI equity investments are taken to retained earnings at the time of derecognition\nof the investment.\nPlacement fees are charged when an underwritten investment is placed with investors. The Group has identified the\nperformance obligations arising from its contracts with investors with whom the investments are placed. The portion of\nthe fee relating to such performance obligations is deferred and recognized over the investment period.\nInvestcorp has reviewed and analyzed the terms of the contracts that it has entered into with its investors arising from the\nplacement of its investments. Based on this review, the Group has determined the following two types of performance\nobligations that Investcorp is expected to satisfy:\ni. services provided by Investcorp during the year from purchase to the placement of the investment with investors,\nincluding deal identification, funding, underwriting, maintaining a placement infrastructure, preparing the marketing\nmaterials for each deal etc; and\nii. services provided over the period of the investment as agreed with the investor at the time of placement.\n126\nCONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS:\nINVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS\nB.S.C.\n(C)\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nInvestcorp has allocated the placement fee to each of the above performance obligations. The Group completes all of its\nperformance obligations described in (i) above before placing an investment with its investors. Accordingly, the fee relating\nto this performance obligation is recognized upfront upon placement of the investment with investors. This portion of the\nplacement fee is included as part of deal fees except for placement fee from program clients which is included as part of\nAUM fees.\nA portion of the placement fee represents the amount received upfront for the performance obligation described in (ii)\nabove. Accordingly, this component of the placement fee is deferred and recognized over time, as AUM fees, over the\nperiod of managing the investment.\nx) Interest expenses\nInterest on borrowings represents funding cost and is calculated using the effective interest rate method, adjusted for gains\nor losses on related cash flow hedges.\nxi) Taxation of foreign operations\nThere is no tax on corporate income in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Taxation on income from foreign subsidiaries is provided\nfor in accordance with the fiscal regulations of the countries in which the respective Group entities operate.\nDeferred taxation is provided for using the liability method on all temporary differences calculated at the rate at which it\nis expected to be payable. Deferred tax assets are only recognized if recovery is probable.\nxii) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term funds, cash in transit, other liquid funds and placements with\nfinancial institutions that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.\nxiii) Receivables\nSubscription receivables are recognized when the obligation is established, i.e., when a binding subscription agreement\nis signed. These are carried at cost less provision for impairment.\nxiv) Advances\nAdvances are stated at amortized cost, net of any impairment provisions.\nxv) Classification of financial assets\n(a) Investments\nThe group classifies the financial assets into various categories as set out in Note 4.\nOn initial investment, a debt investment is measured at amortized cost if the financial asset is held to collect contractual\ncash flows over the life of the asset and if those cash flows comprise solely of principal repayments and interest on the\nprincipal amount outstanding.\nThe Group also classifies certain strategic investments, real estate co-investment, private equity co-investments, strategic\ncapital co-investments, credit management investments and ARI investments as FVOCI investments.\nAll other investments including those over which the Group has significant influence are classified as FVTPL.\n(b) Other liquid assets\nOther liquid assets, which form part of “placements with financial institutions and other liquid assets”, are recorded at\namortized cost less any impairment in value other than those assets which contain embedded derivatives requiring either\nseparation of the embedded derivative or classification of the entire instrument as FVTPL assets. The management has\ndesignated such assets as FVTPL assets.\nxvi) Co-investments\na.

Hedge accounting\nis discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge\naccounting. Accounting treatments for both types of hedges and in the case of discontinuance of hedges are disclosed in\nNote 20.\nFor derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gain or loss arising from changes in their fair value is taken\nto the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nxxi) Premises and equipment\nPremises and equipment substantially comprise land, buildings and related leasehold improvements used by the Group\nas office premises.\nThe Company carries its building on freehold land and certain operating assets at revalued amounts, being the fair value\nof the assets at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated\nimpairment losses. Valuations are performed frequently enough to ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset does not\ndiffer materially from its carrying value. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the asset revaluation reserve included in\nequity, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in profit and\nloss, in which case the increase is recognized in profit or loss. A revaluation deficit is recognized directly in profit or loss,\nexcept that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the\nasset revaluation reserve. A transfer from the asset revaluation reserve to retained earnings is made for any difference\nbetween the depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on the original cost\nof the asset.\n129\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nAll other items are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nPremises and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which are as follows:\nBuildings on freehold land 25 years\nLeasehold and building improvements 10 - 15 years\nOperating assets 3 - 23 years\nThe above useful lives of the assets and methods of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at least at\neach financial year end.\nxxii) Right-of-use assets and lease liability\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are measured at\ncost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\nThe recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an\noption to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any period covered by an option to terminate the\nlease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease\npayments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed\npayments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts\nexpected to be paid under residual value guarantees as applicable. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the\nGroup uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not\nreadily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion\nof interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if\nthere is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the\nassessment to purchase the underlying asset.\nxxiii) Intangible assets\nIntangible assets comprise management contracts and goodwill recognized on acquisition. Management contracts have a\nuseful life of 5 years from the date of the acquisition and are amortized accordingly.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the net\nidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of\nimpairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the\nGroup’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or\nliabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\nThe Group tests goodwill for impairment annually. For other intangible assets, the Group reviews the carrying amounts\nto determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication\nexists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss and if any,\nimpairment loss is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the period.\nxxiv) Payables, accruals and provisions\nProvision for employee benefit costs is made in accordance with contractual and statutory obligations and the terms of\nbenefit plans approved by the Board of Directors (see Note 24).\nProvisions are made when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow\nof resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made\nof the amount of the obligation.\nxxv) Unfunded deal acquisitions\nUnfunded deal acquisitions represent amounts contractually payable by the Group in respect of investment acquisitions\nthe agreements for which are signed, but have not been funded, as of the reporting date.\n130\nCONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS:\nINVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS\nB.S.C.\n(C)\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nxxvi) Borrowings\nBorrowings, represented by short term financing on call, medium-term revolvers, medium-term debt and long-term debt,\nare initially recognized at the fair value of consideration received and subsequently adjusted for the impact of effective\nfair value hedges. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) are treated as collateralized\nfinancings. The corresponding cash received is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position as an asset\nwith a corresponding obligation to return it as a liability within financing, reflecting the transaction’s economic substance\nas a loan to the Group.\nThe securities delivered repurchase agreements are not derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position\nas the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership\nTransaction costs relating to borrowings are initially capitalized and deducted from the borrowings and subsequently\nrecognized as interest expense over the expected life of these borrowings.\nxxvii) Treasury shares\nTreasury shares are stated at acquisition cost and are shown as a deduction to equity. Any surplus arising from the\nsubsequent sale of treasury shares at a price greater than cost is treated as non-distributable and included in a share\npremium reserve under equity. Any deficit arising from the subsequent sale of treasury shares at a price lower than cost is\ncharged first against any previously established reserve from past transactions in treasury shares, and where such reserve\nis insufficient, then any difference is charged to retained earnings.\nxxviii) Share awards\nShare awards to employees are accounted and expense recognized over the vesting period. The determination of the\namount to be recognized is estimated based on a model that takes into account the probability weighted vesting of the\nshares at the fair value on the grant date using the historical pattern of employee tenure. These estimates are updated\nregularly based on actual information.\nxxix) Dividends\nProposed dividends are disclosed as appropriations within equity until the time they are approved by the shareholders. On\napproval by shareholders, these are transferred to liabilities.\n131\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nSENIOR\nMANAGEMENT\n132\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nSENIOR MANAGEMENT\nMohammed Alardhi Andrea Davis\nExecutive Chairman Head of Corporate Strategy\nJoined Investcorp: 2015 Joined Investcorp: 2014\nPrior experience: Investcorp Board Member (8), Prior experience: TDX Group (2),\nNational Bank of Oman S.A.O.G.

The crisis has reinforced the strength of our global\nplatform and enabled us to demonstrate the resilience of Investcorp. We are making good progress in growing the\nbusiness and diversifying our investor, product and geographic base, which has not only helped us weather the\npandemic but emerge from it in a robust position, well placed for future long-term growth.\nThe year ended June 30, 2021 has seen continued positive progress towards the execution of our long-term\nstrategic plan. Whilst the last year has been tumultuous and unpredictable at times, we have once again exhibited\nthe strength of our business model and the resiliency of our diversified offering. Of course, we closely follow and\nmonitor such market volatility but also see opportunity and a chance to recalibrate our operational ambitions. As we\nlook back on the year, it is remarkable to see what we have accomplished.\nWe believe our robust financial results for FY21 are a direct reflection of the flexibility embedded within our long-\nterm growth strategy. Our ability to navigate crises and remain nimble is entrenched in our history and further\nevidenced by the strong performance shown throughout the past year. As we continue our journey of geographical\nand business line diversification, we are confident in our ability to maintain an upward trajectory and remain\nfocused on our steadfast dedication to helping our clients.\nFinancial performance – a resurgent year\nThrough the combination of the successful globalization of our distribution platform, robust capital and liquidity\npositions and our market-leading investment teams, our full fiscal year 2021 results are marked by solid\nperformance across all business lines and strong fundraising levels across asset classes.\nContinuous diversification across geographies and clients translated into a broad-based increase in AUM to a record\nUS $37.6 billion, an increase of 17% from US $32.2 billion in June 2020.\nWe achieved substantial levels of investment activity for FY21 equal to US $3.3 billion, whilst placement and\nfundraising levels totaled US $4.3 billion and distributions of US $3.0 billion remained strong. Total shareholders’\nequity (excluding non-controlling interests) for FY21 was US $1,270 million, a 46% increase compared to\nUS $867 million as of June 30, 2020. Total assets at the end of FY21 were US $2.4 billion, compared with\nUS $2.1 billion last year, representing a 13% increase. The FY21 recommendation for distribution of preferred and\nordinary dividends is US $44 million, with the proposed ordinary dividend being US $0.30 per share versus\nUS $0.10 per share for FY20.The buoyancy of our business lines has resulted in a net profit attributable to equity\nholders of the parent of US $124 million for FY21 compared to a net loss of US $165 million in FY20, owing to\nthe challenging environment and associated effects from the early stages of COVID-19. Diluted earnings per share\nfor FY21 were US $1.34 per share compared to a loss per share of US $2.57 in FY20.\n01\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nAs the market environment and outlook improved over the course of the year, so did fee income which increased by\n24% in FY21 to US $356 million. Furthermore, deal fees increased by 39% to US $139 million driven by strong\nlevels of transactional and fundraising activity. The continued recovery in asset values, driven by improved operating\nresults of underlying portfolio companies as well as healthy financial markets, resulted in asset-based income of\nUS $107 million compared to a loss of US $110 million in FY20.\nDiversification at the heart of our growth\nDespite the multi-faceted nature of the challenges that we have had to navigate throughout the past 12 months,\nwe have nevertheless remained relentlessly committed to maintaining our diversification and growth strategies. We\nhave continued to make significant progress on several key strategic initiatives.\nFirstly, the firm’s expansion into Asia continues to yield positive results; a total of 11 new private equity investments\nwere made during the year across India, China and southeast Asia. AUM in Asia increased by 17% to US $1.1\nbillion at the end of FY21, up from US $0.9 billion in FY20. Additionally, we opened an office in Beijing during\nthe year, whilst also launching our first China healthcare investment platform. The pipeline of opportunities\nemanating from the Asia region remains strong and we stand well positioned to bolster our AUM in the region over\nthe coming years.\nBroader operational highlights include the first closing of the North American Private Equity Fund and Technology\nFund V, as well as continued fundraising for the Investcorp Strategic Capital Partners Fund and the Asia Food\nGrowth Fund. We also secured our first anchor investor in the Aberdeen Standard Investcorp Infrastructure Partners’\n(ASIIP) new regional GCC and MENA infrastructure fund from the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth\nfund of Saudi Arabia.\nDuring the year we announced our intention to delist from the Bahrain Bourse which was completed in July 2021,\nmarking a significant step in our evolution, allowing us to make greater strides as a truly global alternative asset\nmanager towards realizing our ambition of reaching US $50 billion in AUM.\nOur performance in the private equity space remains robust. Our ability to support established businesses that\nbenefit from long-term growth trends and to apply disciplined, active management to these portfolio companies\nis as strong and essential as ever. Private equity and strategic capital AUM increased to US $7.0 billion, with\ninvestment activity for private equity and strategic capital hitting US $1.2 billion for FY21. This included five\nnew investments in the US and Europe, as well as two add-on acquisitions in addition to the 11 investments\nin businesses across Asia. Exit activities included the realization of six private equity investments, including the\nsuccessful sale of Avira to NortonLifeLock, the first exit from the Investcorp Technology Partners Fund IV.\nInvestcorp Credit Management (ICM) also continued its positive growth trajectory, finishing the year with US $14.7\nbillion in AUM, contributing US $60 million in fee income to the group. Operational highlights for ICM through the\nyear to June 30, 2021 include the closing of three new CLOs totaling approximately US $1.4 billion.\nReal Estate AUM rose to US $7.5 billion as real estate markets embarked on a strong recovery, underscoring the\nresiliency of the asset class. A total of approximately US $0.7 billion was deployed into new investments during the\nfiscal year and approximately US $0.7 billion was returned to investors in distributions of ongoing property income\nand sales proceeds. Sales activity during the year included the first exit from the European real estate portfolio,\nmarking a new stage in its maturity. The European real estate business was launched in FY17 and currently has\nAUM of approximately US $1.1 billion.\nThe Investcorp-Tages joint venture, which is the home of our global absolute return investments platform, had a\nvery successful first full financial year of operations. The total income included in Investcorp’s net profit attributable\nto the equity holders of the parent was US $28 million. During the year AUM for the business also increased by\n24% to US $7.6 billion, up from US $6.1 billion last year.\nAt the foundations of our culture are our people\nBeyond our economic growth, we are delighted with the significant strides we have made from a cultural\nperspective. Since our inception almost 40 years ago, we have been rooted in a diverse culture that continues\nto flourish to this day. Our world class talent now numbers around 430 employees, representing 45 different\n02\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nnationalities. We wholeheartedly believe that Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) is a key part of our uniquely\nglobal culture and we understand the critical importance of different perspectives as a driver of thoughtful decision-\nmaking and investment success.\nAccordingly, we are thrilled with the progress we have made over the past 12 months. In July 2020, we appointed\nJordana Semaan as our DEI champion, a role specifically designed to improve our global coordination efforts of\nfirm-wide DEI initiatives. Further to this, in April 2021, we announced that our Strategic Capital business had\nentered into a strategic partnership with Xponance to collaborate on General Partnership staking and seeding\ninterests in diverse and woman-owned alternative asset managers.\nAs an organization, we are focused on being accountable to our goals and we aim to build an environment which is\ncommitted to, and lives and breathes our DEI values.\nOur history of delivering sustainable performance and value creation is something we are immensely proud of and\nour commitment to understanding and acting on the long-term sustainability implications of our investment portfolio\nhas never been stronger. With this in mind, we appointed Habib Abdur-Rahman in October 2020 to lead our efforts\nto enhance ESG alignment across our global investing platform and also became a signatory of the UN Principles\nfor Responsible Investment. Responsible investing has been in our DNA from the beginning, with a particular\nlong-standing focus on exclusion policies. That said, ESG is about more than exclusionary screening, it is about\nresponsibility - responsibility towards all our stakeholders including investors, shareholders, employees and as\nglobal citizens, the communities in which we operate.\nThrough our activities as a capital provider, we see ourselves as responsible for supporting and building sustainable\nbusinesses that fulfill our overarching purpose to enrich the lives of future generations. We are continually working\nto better understand and prioritize our sustainability efforts, and through this process we have formulated a\nframework structured around three pillars of ‘responsibility’. These are: being a responsible operator, being a\nresponsible employer, and being a responsible citizen, and for each of these pillars we hold ourselves accountable\nto KPIs with a detailed roadmap for full adoption over the next two-three years. As we look forward, we have full\nconfidence in our ability to continue to evolve and better ourselves as responsible investors.\nLooking ahead\nWhilst the short-term macro-economic picture remains relatively uncertain, we have an unwavering commitment\nto our long-term growth strategy. Our objective of reaching US $50 billion in AUM remains unchanged and is\nincreasingly within our grasp. Looking forward, we will continue to navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead\nwith the same vigour that we have displayed throughout the past 12 months.\nAs we move further into the second half of calendar 2021 and towards our Ruby Anniversary, we will continue to\nleverage our world class talent, resilient balance sheet and truly diversified platform to meet our clients’ needs with\nan increasingly robust range of investment solutions. It is our mission to foster dynamism and innovative thinking\nacross the firm and together, with your support, we remain well-positioned to build upon our momentum and\neffectively tackle the many opportunities that lie ahead.\nDr. Yousef Hamad Al-Ebraheem Mohammed Mahfoodh Alardhi\nChairman of the Board of Directors Executive Chairman\n03\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nGlobal Excellence\n$6.6B\nTOTAL AUM\nPrivate Equity AUM increased\nby 16% during the year to\nUS $6.6 billion, reflecting the\nwell supported deal-by-deal\nfundraising during the year.\n04\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nPrivate Equity\nAs the world continues to adapt to new challenges and opportunities presented by the\nglobal pandemic, our private equity strategy remains unchanged and our commitment\nto seeking attractive investment opportunities is unwavering.

According to Pitchbook, US PE firms closed\n776 deals in the quarter for a combined $119.5 billion, the second highest quarterly deal value figure on record after\nQ4 2020.

According to Pitchbook, European dealmakers closed on\n1,936 transactions totaling to €158.8 billion, a year-on-year increase of 79.9% and 28.5% respectively. A few factors\ncontributed to the heightened deal activity, including but not limited to the revival in the leveraged lending markets,\nwilling sellers taking advantage of heightened valuations, and pent-up demand from general partners (GPs) eager to\nput their record levels of dry powder to work. As expected, the proportion of IT deal volume hit 24.7%, indicating the\nresistance of the sector to the pandemic. The ubiquitous stay-at-home orders in Q1 2021 continued to drive e-commerce,\ncollaboration platforms, and SaaS adoption.

Unknown values are estimated based on known figures\nSource: Pitchbook Q1 2021 European Breakdown Report\nPRIVATE EQUITY – MENA\nThe beginning of 2021 marked a positive sentiment in oil prices driven by the announcement of stimulus plans in the\nUS, vaccine rollout efforts, rebound in Chinese crude oil imports and the OPEC+ decision to further roll over its nearly\n8 mb/d of oil production cuts until May 2021. The bullish sentiment, however, was largely held in check with overall\ncrude oil prices averaging $61.3 per barrel in Q1 2021 as worries over oil demand in India (third largest oil importer in\nthe world) amid record daily coronavirus infections and the emergence of more virulent coronavirus strains outweighed\npositive economic data from Europe and the US.\nOil prices continued to increase in Q2 2021 averaging at $69.1 per barrel, benefitting from renewed oil demand\noptimism as the vaccine rollout in advanced economies gathered pace leading to easing of mobility restrictions, although\nthe critical public health emergency in India and rising coronavirus cases in Brazil remained key sources of near-term\ndemand concern. In the US and Europe, road and air traffic improved considerably, according to high frequency mobility\ndata. In the US, demand for gasoline reached within 5% of the pre-pandemic level, while in China, oil consumption is\nbelieved to have reached above pre-pandemic levels.\nOverall, crude oil prices averaged at $65.2 per barrel during the first half (H1) of 2021, up 51% from the $43.2\nper barrel average in 2020.

Over the past-year, commercial real\nestate market fundamentals in the US have continued to vary, depending on which asset class is being considered,\nwith industrial and multifamily leading in terms of performance. Investcorp continued to see rent collections in the mid\nto high 90% range through March 2021 across its US real estate portfolio (above the national average). This is largely\ndue to Investcorp’s primary investment focus on the industrial and residential spaces. Per Real Capital Analytics, US\nreal estate transaction volume was down 28% in Q1 2021 compared to the same period a year prior due to COVID-19\nimpacts. However, it is expected that Q1 2021 will be the last quarter where a large year-over-year decline in deal\nvolume will be seen as states reverse shutdown mandates and gain an understanding of how to conduct business in the\ncurrent market environment. Investcorp’s decision several years ago to focus mainly on residential assets (multifamily\nand student housing) and industrial, has proven prudent in the current market.\n43\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nTransaction Volume ($ billions)\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 YTD\n2021\n* Year-To-Date (“YTD”) through Q1, 2021; Source: Real Capital Analytics, Inc. Q1, 2021\nUS market fundamentals for the industrial sector remained robust through Q1 2021. The sector has shown that it is well\npositioned to benefit from the COVID-19 crisis and to lead the economic recovery. According to CBRE, there continues to be\nstrong indicators of ongoing durability in the sector, which included net asking rents rising 7.1% year-over-year and vacancy\nremaining historically low at 4.4% as of Q1 2021. In addition, Q1 2021 recorded positive net absorption of 99.3 million\nsq. ft., which is the 44th consecutive quarter of positive net absorption. Further, Q1 2021 was the third strongest quarter\nin the last 11 years for net absorption, almost 60% above the quarterly average. Experts are of the view that the COVID-19\ncrisis has accelerated an ongoing transition of consumer spending from brick-and-mortar retail to online shopping, creating\nhigher demand for warehouse space. Despite 376 million sq. ft. of industrial space currently under construction, increasing\ndemand from e-commerce and historically strong preleasing is expected to keep asking rates high and continue to push\nvacancy rates to record lows. Additionally, there is renewed interest from both corporations and the government to bring\nmore manufacturing and warehousing/storage back to the US as a result of the disruptions to the US supply chains from\nCOVID-19. Low availability rates and strong leasing demand have resulted in sustained rent growth. The average net\nasking rent grew by 2.2% quarter-over-quarter as of Q1 2021 to $8.44 per sq. ft. – the 38th consecutive quarter of rent\ngrowth. Strong fundamentals through Q1 2021, increased the need for supply chain diversification, and shifting consumer\nsentiment provide strong evidence of continued growth of the industrial sector.\nWhile the US economy was impacted by nationwide job losses due to strict stay-at-home orders issued by most\nstates because of COVID-19 in March 2020, fundamentals in the “for rent” multifamily sector remain relatively\nstrong. Suburban submarkets (where Investcorp invests) continue to outperform urban markets due to COVID-19\nand continued remote-working arrangements. The multifamily market stabilized in Q1 2021, one quarter earlier than\nexpected, on the heels of a COVID-19 vaccine and additional fiscal stimulus and should experience solid performance\nthroughout the rest of 2021. In 2020, owners saw a significant increase in tenant renewals which offset any short-term\nreduction in new leasing and has had the net effect of maintaining strong occupancy. Vacancy rates as of Q1 2021\nremain low at 4.7%, which was up slightly (20 basis points) from the prior quarter. The average rent rose 0.4%, the\nfirst quarterly increase since Q1 2020. According to the National Multifamily Housing Council, rent collections have\nimproved to the mid 90% range nationally across all sub-asset classes; this level is generally consistent with historical\ncollections. Despite the impact of COVID-19, demand for Class B, renter-by-necessity, multifamily housing (Investcorp’s\nfocus) has remained very strong. This is evidenced by Investcorp collecting 96% of rents across its multifamily portfolio\nfor Q1 2021. Among investors, the multifamily sector continues to be viewed as a safe haven.\nThe US office sector was negatively impacted by the strict stay-at-home orders issued by most states starting in March\n2020 due to COVID-19, which has led to a downturn in performance. Despite the significant drop in actual office\noccupancy, credit-quality tenants have continued to pay rent, as is shown by Investcorp’s office portfolio collection rate\nremaining in the mid to high-90% range since the onset of the pandemic. According to CBRE, in Q1 2021, the office\nmarket recorded 34.8 million sq. ft. of negative net absorption, the largest quarterly decline since 2001. Overall office\nvacancy rose by 1.0% quarter-over-quarter to 16.0%, the highest level since 2012. While leasing activity continued to\nbe down in Q1 2021, leasing professionals reported increases in touring activity and prospective tenant inquiries. This\ninterest suggests a possible improvement in figures in Q2 2021. Average gross asking rents in Q1 2021 declined by\n1.6% year-over-year to $34.72 per square foot. A recent study by the Partnership for New York City shows that 62%\nof New York City employers expect employees to return to the office by September 2021, a 17% increase from three\nmonths prior. With New York City as the bellwether, other cities should expect to see a gradual return to office in the\nnear period, which is expected to bring back a return in property performance.\n44\nBUSINESS\nREVIEW\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nThe US student housing sector has historically performed well during prior recessionary periods and was experiencing\nstrong performance in both occupancy and revenue growth before COVID-19 impacted the US in 2020. The impact of\nCOVID-19 has led to varying performance depending on the student housing market. Primary markets with large public\nuniversities (where Investcorp’s student housing assets are located) have fared much better than secondary student\nhousing markets with smaller or private universities. Each underlying university experienced varying performance in the\n2020-2021 academic year depending on the school’s policy on in-person classes. However, for universities that did\nnot fully re-open, a high percentage of students still returned to their schools. Despite COVID-19, effective asking rents\nremained relatively flat year-over-year in the spring of 2021 and saw growth of about 1% since fall 2020. Nationwide\noccupancies are rebounding, with Q1 2021 vacancy at 10.4%, a significant improvement from the 12.0% posted in\nQ3 2020, and only about 1.5% higher than Q1 2020 (the height of COVID-19). With a majority of the country’s largest\nuniversity systems, including the University of California and University of Texas systems, having indicated plans to\nreturn to campus in the fall, it is expected that the student housing asset class will continue to be a strong performing\nasset class, as it is defensive in nature and has outperformed other asset classes in recent years.\nREAL ESTATE INVESTMENT – EUROPE\nUnited Kingdom\nThe UK economy contracted sharply in 2020 with GDP falling 9.8% due to strict lockdowns and the emergence of the\nAlpha COVID-19 variant. For the UK industrial and logistics sector however, 2020 proved to be a record-breaking year\nin which the sector saw unprecedented levels of occupational and investment demand which have continued in H1\n2021. During Q1 2021, UK industrial and logistics take-up reached 14.7 million sq. ft., making the last 12 months the\nmost active period on record. Retailers, parcel delivery companies and third-party logistics accounted for the majority\nof demand. This increase in demand for space combined with the lack of supply continues to put upward pressure on\nrents, with prime rents growing on average 6.2% p.a. since Q2 2020.\nIn Q1 2021 investment volumes for UK logistics reached £2.7 billion, the highest Q1 level seen in more than five\nyears. Prime yields for logistic assets remain under downward pressure and now stand at 3.75%. The long-term outlook\nfor the sector remains positive as the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated ongoing structural market trends, with\ne-commerce making up an ever-increasing share of retail distribution channels.\nIn the office sector, take-up totalled 2.0 million sq. ft in Q1 2021, an increase of more than 200% when compared\nto Q2 2020. Despite this increase in take-up, leasing activity remains well below the five-year quarterly average of\n3.6 million sq. ft. As lockdown restrictions continue to ease, regional office markets are expected to rebound in H2\n2021. Encouragingly, despite subdued take-up levels, record rents have been achieved in many markets, providing\nevidence that occupiers are prepared to pay top rents for quality office schemes. As many companies seek to encourage\nemployees to return to the office, the importance of office as a space for learning, collaboration and well-being is\nbecoming increasingly prominent.\nInvestment volumes in the UK office market (including London) reached £1.07 billion at the end of Q1 2021, a 32%\ndecrease on the long-term average for deals recorded in the first quarter. Prime regional office yields have remained\nstable at 5.00% since April 2020, when yields increased 25 basis points in response to the pandemic. Yields are\nforecast to remain stable in the near term.\nGermany\nAfter more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw GDP contract by 4.9% in 2020, the German office\nmarkets have remained largely resilient to the crisis. After the third wave of COVID-19 infections in early 2021 and a\nresulting lockdown, restrictions were largely relaxed in June 2021. The vaccination program accelerated significantly\nin Q2 2021 and infection rates in June 2021 were very low by international comparison. The Ifo Business Climate\nIndex rose sharply in June 2021 as business optimism for the second half of the year increased. GDP growth of 3.8%\nin forecast for 2021 and the unemployment rate is expected to decrease from 3.8% to 3.6% in 2022.\n45\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nThe ‘Big 7’ German office markets (Berlin, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart) recorded\ntake-up of approximately 1.2 million sq. m. in H1 2021, which represents a 1% year-on-year increase. Corporate\nreluctance to relocate to new premises has kept the volume of new leases below the 10-year average level in H1 2021.\nThe amount of office space in all of Germany’s top 7 cities that is available at short notice grew slightly during the first\ntwo quarters of 2021, on average by 1.1 %. The average vacancy rate across the ‘Big 7’ increased from 3.8% to 3.9%.\nDespite this minor increase, the vacancy rate remains low with quality space in short supply, this is evident in rental\nrates which have seen little change with prime rents in the ‘Big 7’ remaining stable in H1 2021.\nWith occupational demand somewhat subdued during H1 2021, take-up is expected to rebound in the remainder of the\nyear. Due to the uncertain economic situation, many companies have paused their leasing decisions in the short term\nhowever, with greater clarity as the pandemic progresses and the vaccination program gains traction, companies will\nbecome more active once again, generating more demand in the office market. Since companies require a lead time for\ntheir plans, a noticeable increase in letting activity is mainly expected from Q4 2021.\nOverall, the investment market for offices located in Germany’s top 7 cities was gathering momentum by the end of Q2\n2021 with transactions totaling €12.5 billion. Prime yields remained stable in H1 2021, having remained unchanged\nfrom 2020. Due to greater demand for core real estate, the average prime yield on offices contracted slightly to 2.88\n% (-0.05 percentage points). Yields are likely to decline further in the near term as appetite for German offices remains\nrobust with investors keen to deploy capital in the sector. The investment market for core plus and value-added office\nproduct, which saw very little transaction activity in 2020, showed signs of recovery in Q2 2021.\nThe Netherlands\nThe Dutch economy fared relatively well in 2020, contracting by 3.7% compared to the euro-zone average of 6.8%.\nThe downturn was less severe as compared to European countries due to less strict lockdowns. GDP growth of 2.7%\nis forecast for 2021 with an unemployment rate of 4.3% in 2021, rising to 4.4% in 2022. The Netherlands started\nto ease COVID-19 lockdown measures in Q2 2021 as the country came out of its third wave of infections, allowing\nemployees to return to the office. As is the case in Germany, it is expected that the easing of restrictions and opening of\nthe economy will lead to a recovery of the occupational office market in the second half of 2021.\nOffice take-up in the Netherlands was approximately 402,000 sq. m. in H1 2021, a 29% decrease compared to H1\n2020. Expansion or relocation plans of office occupiers were predominantly put on hold. Thus, despite declining take-\nup, the vacancy rate in the Netherlands remained stable around 8.2%.\nPrime office rents in The Netherlands remained stable in Q1 2021. In secondary locations, incentives have risen\nwhich has impacted net effective rents. The office investment volume in Q1 2021 declined by 65% to €472 million\ncompared to the same period last year. Prime office yields remained stable in H1 2021 at 2.85% as investors focused\non low-risk core investments with prime tenants and long-term leases. As is the case in Germany, there are signs that\nthe investment market for core plus and value-added product is rebounding as of Q2 2021.\nBelgium\nThe Belgian economy was severely impacted by COVID-19 in 2020 with a decline in GDP of 8%. Lockdown restrictions\ncontinued to drag on activity in Q1 2021, however, the easing of restrictions in mid-April 2021 alongside the rollout\nof the vaccine has led to a pickup in momentum, with record quarterly growth forecast in Q3 2021. GDP growth of\n4.3% is forecast for 2021 with unemployment expected to gradually decrease to stand at 6.7% at the end of 2023.\nOccupational take-up in Brussels totaled 110,000 sq. m. in Q1 2021, which is the second best start to the year since\n2015, although this was driven by a relatively small number of deals. Most large occupiers continue to adopt a ‘wait-\nand-see’ approach to their office space requirements. The office market vacancy rate remained stable at 7.5% in Q1\n2021, as did prime rents.\nCommercial real estate investment activity in Brussels remained in line with previous years at €535 million (Q1 2021),\nhowever, two large owner-occupier transactions accounted for more than 60% of the total. Prime yields remained stable\nat 3.5% which is a historic low. Appetite for core products remains strong.\n46\nBUSINESS\nREVIEW\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nREAL ESTATE INVESTMENT – INDIA\nGlobal Trends\nQ1 2020 was the second consecutive quarter to register residential quarterly sales that surpassed the 2019 pre-\nCOVID-19 average. Residential sales were impacted in the months of April and May due to the second COVID-19\nwave in India. Sales activity restarted in June and has shown initial signs of a continued recovery in residential real\nestate. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the need for home ownership and the requirement for larger homes, which\ncoupled with other factors such as multi-decade low home loan interest rates, competitive house prices, developer\ndriven flexible payment schemes as well as stamp duty cuts in key micro-markets, is expected to serve as a catalyst to\nreignite latent demand.\nInvestments\nInvestor activity bounced back sharply in Q1 2021. Q1 witnessed investments in the real estate sector to the tune of\n$3.2 billion, which is equivalent to 80% of that witnessed in full year 2020 and 48% of full year 2019. The recovery in\ninvestments (in value terms) was primarily driven by the office and retail segments. The recovery was evident in volumes\n(number of deals) as well. Q1 2021 witnessed 19 deals compared to 21 deals in the entire 2020. The residential\nsegment witnessed investments totalling $234 million in Q1 2021. The investor preference, which had moved from\nequity to debt in the last decade, again tilted in favour of equity in 2020 and Q1 2021, indicating a resurgence in risk\nappetite. The office segment witnessed investments worth $2.1 billion in Q1 2021, which is equivalent to 92% of\nthat witnessed during the full year 2020 and 72% of investments during entire 2019. The retail segment witnessed\ninvestments worth $484 million compared to $220 million during the full year 2020.\nResidential Sector\nSales recorded in Q1 2021 were higher by 17% over the previous quarter. The Q1 2021 sales were also 17% higher\nthan the 2019 quarterly average sales. In addition to other factors as highlighted above, continuation and permanent\nadoption of work from home by the IT industry provided a boost to sales.\nHealthy growth in sales also encouraged developers to launch new projects. New launches were 36% higher than 2019\nquarterly average launches.\nIndia Market Snapshot (Quarterly)\nQ1 21 as %\nQ1 21 YoY of 2019 Qtr\nQ2 2020 Q3 2020 Q4 2020 Q1 2021 Growth (%) Avg.\nSales (Housing Units) 9,632 33,403 61,593 71,963 44% 117%\nLaunches (Housing Units) 5,884 31,106 55,033 76,006 38% 136%\nGoing forward, with expectation of rapid vaccination progress and economic aspirations to return to normality, activity\nlevels are expected to improve once important vaccination milestones are achieved.\nCommercial Office Sector\nKeeping pace with the recovery momentum witnessed during Q4 2020, gross leasing activity recorded a 5.3% quarter-\non-quarter growth with 12.2 million sq. ft. of Grade A office space leased during Q1 2021.

The global economy is continuing its post-pandemic\nrecovery, central banks remain accommodative, capital markets are accessible to borrowers and credit fundamentals\nare improving. These factors drove strong H1 returns for high yield (HY) and leveraged loans of 3.89% and 3.48%2 ,\nrespectively which are expected to extend into H2. Demand for leveraged loans, given their low duration and floating\nrate nature, should benefit from continued concerns about rising rates that drove strong returns in H1 2021.\nCredit fundamentals continue to improve as a sharp post-pandemic economic recovery has accelerated into Q3 2021.\nRevenue and EBITDA are increasing, leverage is declining (from a spike of 6.41x in Q2 2020 down to 5.36x as of Q1\n20213 ), default activity is low and these improving trends are expected to accelerate as the anniversary of the weakest\nquarters during the pandemic is approached. Borrowers have taken advantage of favorable capital markets conditions\nto improve liquidity and extend maturities. The current 1.25% trailing twelve-month default rate is significantly down\nfrom a peak of 4.17% in September and the current distress ratio of 1.02% is at the lowest level since November\n20144 . Default rates are expected to remain below average for the remainder of 2021 and 2022 with most strategists\ncalling for 1.0%-2.0% through 2021.\nDespite record low yields for bonds and loans, continued strong performance for leveraged credit is expected. On a\nrelative value basis, loan yields look attractive compared to high yield bonds. Yields for the HY bond index (4.37%)\nare only 21bps above that of loan issuers (4.16%), compared to a 92bps gap for the cross issuer base since 20105.\nFrom a technical perspective, demand for loans remains robust. CLO issuance ended at a record $79 billion6 in H1\nand is projected to reach $140 billion for the full year7 which would surpass the full year record of $129 billion in\n2018. Inflows into loan retail mutual funds and ETFs have been averaging over $750 million per week year-to-date8 as\ninvestors, worried about rates, continue to favor the floating rate nature of loans.\nOn the supply side, given extremely low yields, 2021 has seen a record pace of leveraged credit issuance ($330 billion\nin leveraged loans and $286 billion in HY bonds9 ). The total market size outstanding surpassed $3 trillion at the end\nof H1 202110. Many strategists have now revised their initial 2021 full year issuance projections to more than $600\nbillion in loans and more than $500 billion in HY bonds.\nUS market outlook\nInvestcorp continues to expect strong US economic growth to sustain into 2022 albeit at more modest levels than\nthe torrid, immediate post-COVID-19 growth rates currently underway. Consensus expectations are that the Fed will\nlikely begin tapering its asset purchases late this year and is likely to begin raising rates in the first half of 2023, if not\nsomewhat sooner. Leveraged credit, and loans in particular, are expected to continue to perform well in this environment.\nIn terms of Investcorp’s current industry positioning and concerns in the US market, the Delta variant concerns could\ndelay some of the full potential of the reopening, but not derail the recovery. In particular, Investcorp is less concerned\nabout Delta in geographies with high degrees of vaccination penetration. Investcorp is aware of the pressures that wage,\nmaterial and other input cost inflation could put on earnings. However, given robust economic demand, most borrowers\nin Investcorp’s portfolio have been able to offset these pressures with price increases and expect some of these\nstructural pressures to ease later in the year. The Firm is more cautious on sectors and individual credits with “reversion\nrisk” and have reduced exposure in areas where we are unsure of the sustainability of the COVID-19 led demand bump.\nInvestcorp continues to drive value and outperformance through a “front footed” active trading and portfolio management\napproach focused on protecting principal while also finding opportunities for capturing total return and convexity.\n2 Source: Credit Suisse High Yield Index, Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index, June 30, 2021.\n3 Source: S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, March 31, 2021.\n4 Source: S&P LCD News, July 1, 2021.\n5 Source: JP Morgan, High-Yield and Leveraged Loan Morning Intelligence, July 16, 2021.\n6 Source: S&P LCD, June 29, 2021.\n7 Source: JP Morgan, 2021 Mid-Year High-Yield Bond and Leveraged Loan Outlook, June 28, 2021.\n8 Source: JP Morgan, High-Yield and Leveraged Loan Morning Intelligence, July 16, 2021.\n9 Source: S&P LCD, June 29, 2021.\n10 Source: S&P/LCD News, July 15, 2021.\n50\nBUSINESS\nREVIEW\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nEUROPEAN MARKET\nTotal new issuance levels across the European leveraged loan and high yield markets set record levels in H1 2021,\nas the market was flooded with deals either from private equity deploying its dry powder in new transactions after\na relatively barren COVID-19 hit 2020, issuers accessing more liquidity to drive COVID-19 recovery plays or private\nequity sponsors refinancing the deals which were transacted at premium pricing in 2020.\nTo put this in context, the total issuance across loans and high yield of €151.5 billion in H1 2021 was €11 billion or\n8% above the previous record year in 2007. High yield issuance set an outright record at €70.6 billion in H1 2021 and\nloan issuance of €80.9 billion, although behind the record H1 2007 issuance of €118.4 billion, looks set to potentially\nrival the full year tally for issuance in 2007 of €165.5 billion.\nDespite this significant level of issuance, the leveraged loan market generally absorbed the new issuance as new CLO\nissuance and repayments alongside pent up demand for assets kept the demand for assets high. In fact, Europe saw a\nsupply deficit for much of H1 2021 providing a strong technical tailwind.\nAs a result, issuers generally benefitted from favorable pricing, with tightening spreads through most of H1 2021. This\nin turn fueled an increase in opportunistic dividend recap and refinancing activity by sponsors. The secondary market\nbid also held up well as demand for assets remained strong.\nFrom a credit risk perspective, the original predictions of high single digit default rates for loans in Europe has\nnot materialized. The combination of easily available liquidity from governments and/or markets and private equity\nsponsors alongside the almost completely covenant-lite nature of the European market, which has removed any\ntriggers for a default unless an issuer runs out of liquidity, has meant that defaults, despite the clear COVID-19 related\nunderperformance of some credits, have been almost non-existent. H1 2021 saw the default rate for European\nleveraged loans continue to decrease, ending the half year at 1.13% having started the year at 2.57%. To put this\nin full context, the European default rate is now only just above the level of 0.97% recorded in February 2020\nimmediately before the COVID-19 crisis.\nThis all fed into positive returns for European leveraged loans and high yield bonds in H1 2021. European leveraged\nloans generated a return of 2.91%, with the average price of the index finishing the half year at 98.74% (versus\n97.35% at the end of December 2020). Returns were driven by higher risk assets, as the low default rates and\nCOVID-19 recovery plays enticed more risk taking across the market, with CCC loans returning +10.73% in H1 2021\nwhile Single-B’s gained +2.50% and BB loans returned +1.29%11.\nEuropean High Yield bonds were similarly positive, generating a return of +3.26%, with the average price of the index\nfinishing June 2021 at 100.91% (versus 98.58% at the end of December 2020)12.\nEuropean market outlook\nLooking forward into H2 2021, European credit markets seem set for a positive second half driven by increasing\nspreads and ultra-low default levels.\nThe European leveraged loan market has started to show the first signs that the weight of primary issuance seen to\ndate, and expected going forward, is starting to cause some indigestion. New issuance loan spreads increased in June\n2021, as a combination of the strong forward primary pipeline, with new issuance showing no signs of abating in the\nnear term, reduced repayments and slowdown in demand for CLO AAA assets in Europe has shifted the supply/demand\nbalance.\nGiven the relative reliance on CLOs in the European market, which represent over 50% of primary issue demand in the\nmarket13, this last point is especially important as European loans tend to generate very strong underlying new issue\nspreads in the periods where primary issuance is high and the new CLO issuance market is more difficult. Although\nCLO AAA spreads averaged 86 bps in Q1 2021 the expectation is that spreads will increase to 100bps+ in Q3 2021\ngiven the relative level of supply and demand in the new issuance CLO market.\n11 Credit Suisse Western European Leveraged Loan Index, June 30, 2021\n12 Credit Suisse Western European High Yield Bond Index, June 30, 2021\n13 S&P LCD, July 2021\n51\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nThe dynamic seen in June 2021 has continued into July, resulting in both spreads on new issue widening and some\nsoftness in the secondary market, especially in low rating/lower spread names, and it is expected to continue through\nQ3 2021 and potentially into Q4 2021 if, as expected, new issuance is maintained at current levels.\nPositively, the overall size and liquidity of the European leveraged loans market has benefitted from the recent levels of\nnew issuance. The market (per the Credit Suisse Western European Leveraged Loan Index) now comprises 520 issuers\nwith a face value of €340 billion compared to 507 issuers and a face value of €310 billion at the end of December\n201914. The size of the market is expected to continue to grow over 2021, providing more opportunity to diversify risk\nand actively manage portfolios.\nFrom a credit risk perspective, it is hard to see at the current time the driver for an increase in default rates in the\nnear term, despite the fears of a Delta variant driven third (or fourth) wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe. Defaults are\nexpected to occur in the market but likely in 2022 and beyond as issuers deal with either the removal of government\nliquidity or the overall strain on their balance sheets from COVID-19. However, even these defaults are expected to be\nsporadic and it is more likely that the more overly levered credits across the European market will see their maturities\nextended so that they can eventually grow out of their current structures given that a default is unlikely to be the best\noption for issuers or investors.\nClearly, risks do still exist in the market. In the short-term inflation is a potential issue across all issuers in credit markets\nboth in terms of long-term wage inflation as employment normalizes and in the time lag between increases in input\nprices and the ability of issuers to pass that on to customers. However, these impacts are expected to feed through\nInvestcorp’s portfolio companies over 2021 and to be broadly offset by the increase in performance as the COVID-19\nrecovery continues. Longer term, Investcorp is still wary of the impact of the eventual removal of central bank stimulus\nfrom European markets.\nOverall H2 2021 is expected to provide strong investment opportunities for Investcorp’s Funds. Given Investcorp’s\nstrong market position, the Firm is well placed to continue to benefit from the strong, well-priced primary issuance seen\nrecently and to use this to rotate portfolios to increase yields.\n14 Credit Suisse Western European Leveraged Loan Index, June 30, 2021\n52\nBUSINESS\nREVIEW\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2021\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS\nRESULTS FOR THE YEAR\nResults for the year include fee income from client-centric activities and asset-based income from returns generated\non balance sheet assets, including unrealized changes in fair value of co-investments in Investcorp’s private equity\n(‘PE’), real estate (‘RE’), absolute return investments (‘ARI’), strategic capital (‘SC’) products, strategic investments\nand investments in joint ventures and associates, rental yields on RE co-investments and accrued returns and\nimpairment losses/reversals on credit management (‘CM’) exposures.\nDespite the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macro-economic and fiscal environment, profit for\nthe year of $125 million reflects a strong turnaround from the loss of $165 million for the prior fiscal year (FY20).\nInvestcorp’s FY21 results were driven by good levels of activity across all asset classes, resulting in an annualized return\non equity (‘ROE’) of 13% and fully diluted earnings per share (‘EPS’) of $1.34 per ordinary share.\n% Change\nIncome ($ millions) FY21 FY20 H/(L)\nFee income 356 288 24%\nAsset-based (loss) income 107 (110) >100%\nGross operating income 463 178 >100%\nProvisions for impairment (4) (26) (85%)\nInterest expense (31) (40) (23%)\nOperating expenses (290) (275) 5%\nProfit (loss) before tax 138 (163) >100%\nIncome tax expense (13) (2) >100%\nProfit (loss) for the year 125 (165) >100%\nBasic earnings per ordinary share ($) 1.42 (2.57) >100%\nFully diluted earnings per ordinary share ($) 1.34 (2.57) >100%\nFee income increased to $356 million (FY20: $288 million) driven by an increase in both AUM fees as well as in deal\nfees.

The increase in working capital is a temporary increase primarily due to a higher level of\nsubscriptions receivable driven by a high level of placement activity and higher exit proceeds receivables. The increase\nin underwriting & warehousing is due to higher deployment at year end, providing a strong pipeline for the launch of\nplacements in FY22. The significant decrease in total co-investments by $179 million was driven by a decrease in\nPE, RE, ARI and CM co-investment resulting from net realizations during the fiscal year.

The affirmation also reflects the Firm’s increased earnings\nvolatility and placement risk relative to peers, given its business model of offering investments to clients on a fully\nunderwritten deal-by-deal (DBD) basis and its sizable co-investment portfolio, which is subject to fair value changes.”\nIn June 2020, Moody’s revised Investcorp’s credit ratings from Ba2 ‘Stable’ outlook to Ba2 ‘Negative’ outlook and no\nadditional rating actions have been taken. “The rating reflects Investcorp’s solid market position in the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil (GCC) region as a leading alternative investment provider, its global franchise, historically healthy operating\nmargins and good asset retention. Furthermore, Investcorp’s level of assets under management, liquidity and equity\nare expected to remain resilient.

RISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk management is an integral part of the Group(cid:146)s corporate decision-making process. The iFnancial and Risk\nManagement Committee (FRMC) oversees the Group(cid:146)s risk management activities, and sets the Group(cid:146)s risk profile\non an enterprise wide basis. The FRMC is comprised of members of senior management drawn from all eky areas o f\nthe Group.\nTheG roup(cid:146)sp rimaryr iskm anagemento bjectivei st os upporti tsb usinesso bjectivesw iths ufficiente conomicc apital .\nThe Group employs risk models to determine the capital needed to cover unexpected losses from investment or\nother risks. This capital amount is known as economic capital. The economic capital requirement for each reportin g\nsegment is determined for a one year horizon and subsequently aggregated to determine the total economic capital .\nThis total economic capital is then stress tested under a dynamic aR Vapproach.

The Group manages counterparty credit risk by setting limits\nfor all counterparties. The Group also monitors credit exposures, and continually assesses the creditworthiness o f\ncounterparties. Counterparty credit risk in respect of derivative financial instruments is limited to those with positiv e\nfair values. ithW respect to the counterparty credit risk exposure arising from other financial assets, the Group has\na maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments. The Group also actively attempts to mitigat e\ncounterparty credit risks, where possible, through documented netting and margin arrangements with counterparties ,\nunder ISDA and CSA agreements.\nThe risk management team maintains an overall external rating-based methodology for setting Board approved\ncounterparty limits. or Frated counterparties, credit ratings from at least two rating agencies are used for developin g\ncounterparty limits. All non-rated counterparties are screened through due diligence and credit analysis prior to the\nassumption of credit exposures to them by Investcorp. These non-rated counterparties are also categorized under the\n(cid:145)Standard(cid:146) internal rating for financial reporting purposes.\nThe table below shows the relationship between the internal rating* and the category of the external rating grades:\nInternal Rating External Rating by S & P and Moody(cid:146)s\nHigh AAA to A\nStandard A(cid:150) to B(cid:150)\n* The internal rating is used to determine provisions and impairments for financial reporting purposes.\nInternal rating categories are summarized as follows:\nHigh - there is a very high elliikhood of the asset being recovered in full and collateral may be available .\nStandard (cid:150) whilst there is a high elliikhood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, represents low risk to the\nGroup, the asset may not be collateralized.\nCbut cotnetrrmasct thuea l taoc cordidnuge is paymenwth en due past caosn sideriesed x poousnurtrieesr kcp raerdit ty\nis not received.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION\nInvestcorp has a clear and well-defined (cid:147)pay for risk-adjusted long-term performance(cid:148) philosophy that pervades its\nculture and motivates its employees to target delivery of consistent top-quartile performance. This philosophy is\nexhibited in Investcorp(cid:146)s remuneration programs and it is reflected in its annual remuneration decisions.\nThe remuneration that is paid to Investcorp(cid:146)s employees is divided into two fundamental components: (i) fixed\nremunerat,i oin.e., salary and benefits, and (ii) variable remunerat .ion\nariable Vremunerat,i oncomprised of cash and awards under deferred remuneration programs, is remuneration that\nvaries from year to year and the amount of which is dependent upon (i) the financial performance of Investcorp as a\nristkhw-(ehai odilj)peu e,sr teedpm eepafrltco(bohrhriuyoee misef atsaiie nohpfn)n(cid:146)dfe eoc els cresio tm snfia e vn ec e\nindividual employee.\nI nsomia trysdagleero ezrerspvirnparileuos ifmcn.teeteudr rst tanexespovesminea thr(cid:146)aTg sroe feerroenpayuomleprme\n.woleb ylfeirb debircsed sa smargorp deknil-erahs dna smargorp tnemtsevnio-c dna tseretni deirrac tnemtsevni fo desirpmoc\n156\nPrograms for Investment Profit aPrticipation\nrelatiinovnesshtimp ent and investmenets tate reali nvestmenetq,u ity private its inp rofeisnsvieosntamlesGn rto up(cid:146)s The\nmanagement lines of business participate in investment carried interest programs, whereby a certain variable portion\nof exit proceeds due to investors from realization of their investments is shared with these professionals, provided\ncertainp re-establishedm inimumc lientr eturnh urdlesa res atisfied.N ettingm echanismsa reu seds ot hatr eturnsf rom\ninvestments that perform well are netted against other investments in which losses are sustained.

          "content": "Investcorp’s full year results for the fiscal year ended 30\nJune 2022\nSolid performance across all business lines delivers a 9% increase in net profit attributable\nto the equity holders of the parent to US$ 135 million\nContinued growth in Assets Under Management (AUM) to a record high of US$ 42.7 billion,\ndriven by strong demand for Investcorp’s product offerings\nInvestcorp has released its fiscal year results for the twelve months ended 30 June 2022 (FY22). The\nfull set of financial statements are available on Investcorp’s website at www.investcorp.com.\nInvestcorp’s FY22 results were driven by good levels of activity across the core businesses of private\nequity, real estate, credit management and absolute return investments. This resulted in delivering a\nnet profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent of US$ 135 million compared to US$ 124\nmillion in FY21.\nTotal shareholders’ equity (excluding non-controlling interest) as of June 30, 2022 increased 3% to\nUS$ 1,314 million (FY21: US$ 1,270 million) and total assets were US$ 2,295 million (FY21:\nUS$ 2,391 million). The FY22 recommendation for distribution of preferred and ordinary dividends is\nUS$ 57 million in aggregate (including interim dividends on preference shares), with the proposed\nordinary dividend being US$ 0.30 per share.\nFinancial and operational highlights\n• Continued progress on strategy to drive greater recurring fee revenues and enhance earnings\nprofile. AUM fees, transaction and advisory income of US$ 411 million increased by 15%\ncompared to US$ 356 million in FY21. Recurring AUM fees of US$ 240 million grew by 11%\ncompared to US$ 217 million in FY21, reflecting a higher level of client assets under\nmanagement and strong fundraising during the year. Transaction and advisory income of US$\n171 million grew by 23% compared to US$ 139 million in FY21, driven primarily by good levels\nof transactional and fundraising activity and performance of the underlying assets under\nmanagement.\n• AUM grew to a record high of US$ 42.7 billion, a 14% increase compared to US$ 37.6 billion\nas of June 30, 2021, driven by the broad-based diversification of the franchise across\ngeographies, clients, and products.\n• Asset-based income from co-investment business and others of US$ 109 million for FY22\nwas up 2% compared to US$ 107 million in FY21. The results reflect good performance of\nthe underlying investments across all asset classes.\n• Activity metrics were solid with investment activity of US$ 4.9 billion (FY 21: US$ 3.3 billion),\ntotal fundraising of US$ 7.4 billion (FY 21: US$ 4.3 billion) and distributions of US$ 4.5 billion\n(FY21: US$ 3.0 billion).\n• Investment activity of US$ 4.9 billion includes US$ 1.2 billion for private equity and strategic\ncapital, US$ 1.2 billion for real estate, US$ 2.4 billion for various CLOs and US$ 120 million\ninto an insurance business in the U.S. providing fixed annuities. Private equity investments\nincluded five new investments in the US and Europe and four new investments in Asia.\n• Exit activities included the full realization of eight private equity investments in the US, Europe\nand MENA, the partial realization of one private equity investment in the US, and the sale of\nmultiple real estate properties in the US and Europe, including the first exit from Investcorp’s\nEuropean (ex-UK) portfolio with the sale of Bürocampus Wangen in Stuttgart, Germany.\n• Total fundraising reached a record high of US$ 7.4 billion raised across private and\ninstitutional clients for new deal-by-deal offerings, fund products and SPAC IPOs, as well as\nthe pricing/issuance and resets of several CLOs.\n• As of June 30, 2022, total equity (excluding non-controlling interests) was US$ 1,314 million\nand total accessible liquidity was US$ 1.3 billion. The increase in equity (excluding non-\ncontrolling interests) is largely due to the strong results for the year partially offset by the\npayment of FY21 dividends and purchase of treasury shares during the year.\n• The size of the balance sheet decreased by 4% to US$ 2.3 billion from US$ 2.4 billion as a\nresult of strong business and fundraising activities which translated into lower underwriting\nand lower working capital that was partially offset by fair value gains and higher co-investment\nbalances in line with the AUM growth as new products/offering are launched.\n• Net debt declined to US$ 353 million in FY22 from US$ 443 million in FY21. The improved\nnet debt position together with a high level of equity and liquidity puts the balance sheet in a\nstrong position heading into the next fiscal year.\nInvestcorp also continued to make progress on a number of key strategic initiatives:\n• Successfully concluded the Firm’s first Murabaha facility which was oversubscribed with a\nfinal participation of US$ 440 million.\n• Successfully sponsored the IPOs of two SPACs, one focused on European investments and\none focused on Indian investments. Both SPACs are listed on NASDAQ. The gross proceeds\nfrom both offerings were in excess of US$ 600 million and were heavily oversubscribed. The\nsuccessful IPOs reflect the confidence of market participants in Investcorp as an institutional\nsponsor and are a testament to Investcorp’s history and track record in acquiring good\nbusinesses and helping them deliver sustainable long-term value to shareholders.\n• Announced the launch of eLydian Lion 1, the first dedicated institutional blockchain and\nShariah-compliant fund based in the GCC, with a global investment mandate. The Fund –\nwhich will be led from Investcorp’s Abu Dhabi office – is expected to be deployed globally and\nwill focus on investments in companies leading the next digital evolution driven by blockchain\ntechnology.\n• Launched a private infrastructure investment business in North America. The new platform\nwill apply the Firm’s global expertise and track record in real estate and private equity to make\ninvestments in critical infrastructure companies and projects across North America.\n• Held the final close of the Investcorp Strategic Capital Partners Fund with capital\ncommitments of US$ 620 million.\n• Led a US$ 55 million investment in NDR Warehousing Private Limited, one of the largest\nIndian warehousing platforms. This was the first India domestic fundraising by the Firm, which\nwas anchored by BAE.\n• Released its 2021 Responsible Business Report. The report includes Investcorp’s\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) highlights for 2021 and specific initiatives the\nFirm implemented to meet its goals, as well as some case studies illustrating areas where the\nfirm has demonstrated its commitment to responsibility as a core component of its values and\nculture. The full report is available on the website: https://www.investcorp.com/esg/\n• Announced the growth of its footprint in the United States with the opening of its Los Angeles\noffice. As part of the expansion, Scott Goldchain was hired as a senior relationship manager\nin charge of the West Coast who will be responsible for growing the firm’s LP relationships in\nthe region.\n• Announced the formation of a new venture to acquire industrial real estate assets in the\nUnited States, in partnership with two leading sovereign wealth funds.\n• Launched the Investcorp Insurance Solutions platform, the firm’s newly formed business that\nwill focus on providing investment management services to meet the unique investment\nneeds of insurers.\n• Launched a Saudi focused Pre-IPO Growth Fund, dedicated to investing in a diversified\nportfolio of companies at a “pre-IPO” stage of development in Saudi Arabia.\n• The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank announced that it will anchor the Aberdeen\nStandard Investcorp Infrastructure Partners’ (ASIIP) new regional fund by committing US$ 90\nmillion to its first close. ASIIP had also received a capital commitment from the Public\nInvestment Fund (PIF) for up to 20% of the Fund’s total size.\nSigned on behalf of the Board of Directors\nDr. Yousef Hamad Al-Ebraheem Mohammed Mahfoodh Saad Alardhi\nChairman Executive Chairman\nJuly 28th, 2022"

(CLOSED)\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOpinion\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. (closed)\n(\"the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”), which comprise of the\nconsolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2022, and the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of other comprehensive income,\nconsolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the\nyear then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of\nsignificant accounting policies.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2022, and its\nconsolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).\nBasis of Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our\nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities\nfor the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are\nindependent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for\nAccountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International\nIndependence Standards) (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are\nrelevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Kingdom of Bahrain, and\nwe have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and\nthe IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nOther Information Included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report\nOther information consists of the information included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report,\nother than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Board\nof Directors is responsible for the other information.

(CLOSED) (continued)\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nOther Information Included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report (continued)\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to\nread the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other\ninformation is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our\nknowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on\nthe work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of the auditor’s\nreport, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are\nrequired to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as\nthe Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for\nassessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters\nrelated to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Board of\nDirectors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic\nalternative but to do so.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and\nto issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of\nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always\ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and\nare considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected\nto influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain\nprofessional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate\nto provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement\nresulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve\ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal\ncontrol.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF INVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED) (continued)\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of\naccounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern\nbasis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the\nGroup’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material\nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the\nrelated disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are\ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence\nobtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions\nmay cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial\nstatements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial\nstatements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves\nfair presentation.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the\nentities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision\nand performance of the Group audit.

An example of a\nmaterial event would be where a sale is imminent and credible bids have been received\nfrom third parties or valuations have been received from banks engaged in the sale\nprocess. In these cases, the fair value would be established with reference to the range\nof bids received and based on management's assessment of the most likely realization\nvalue within that range. Another example of a material event would be where an arm's\nlength financing transaction has occurred recently that is (a) material in nature, (b)\ninvolves third parties, and (c) attaches an implicit value to the company. In the event that\nsuch a recent third-party measure of specific fair value for an individual investment is not\navailable, the fair value is determined by using a multiples-based approach applied to\nthe most recent and relevant operating performance metric of the underlying company,\ntypically EBITDA and sometimes sales. The multiple used is taken from a universe of\ncomparable publicly listed companies, recent M&A transactions involving comparable\ncompanies, and Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) analysis.\nManagement exercises its judgment in choosing the most appropriate multiple, on a\nconsistent basis, from within the universe referred to above.\nOf the above, co-investments amounting to $35.1 million (June 30, 2021: $32.2 million)\nare classified as FVOCI investments. For FVOCI investments, during the year, a gain of\n$2.7 million (2021: loss of $5 million) was recognized in other comprehensive income\nand $0.6 million (2021: losses of $27.6 million) of gains were recycled to retained\nearnings on derecognition.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n10.

The adjusted amortised cost is calculated based\non the original set EIR. The accrual based on EIR and any losses arising from\nimpairment of such investments are included in asset based income in the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss.\nThe fair value of CLO co-investments categorized as FVOCI is determined on the basis\nof inputs from independent third parties including internal management assessment of\nthe projected cashflows.\nOf the above, co-investments amounting to $103.7 million (June 30, 2021: $110.1\nmillion) are classified as FVOCI investments.

Subsequent to the year end, the Group\nhas drawn $350 million from this facility.\nMedium term facilities are all floating rate instruments with average margin over LIBOR\nof 275 basis points (June 30, 2021: 275 basis points).\nPrivate Notes\nLong-term notes issued by the Group carry fixed rates of interest and are governed by\ncovenants contained in the relevant agreements. Such covenants include maintaining\ncertain minimum levels of net worth and operating below a maximum leverage ratio. The\nprivate notes are fixed rate instruments, however through hedging the Group incurs a\nfloating rate interest cost of 100 basis points to 265 basis points (June 30, 2021: 100\nbasis points to 265 basis points) over LIBOR.\nSecured Financing\nSecured financing relates to financing obtained under repurchase transaction\narrangements entered into by the Group, with underlying assets being CLO co-\ninvestment exposures in Europe. The financings carry variable rates of interest. Each\nfinancing arrangement has a specified repurchase date at which the Group will\nrepurchase the underlying CLO asset at a pre-determined repurchase price.\nLease Liabilities\nThe Group recognizes lease liabilities at the commencement date of the lease measured\nat the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term.\nDuring the year, the Group repaid $11.9 million (June 30, 2021: $12.2 million) of lease\nliabilities, recognized an additional lease liabilities of $4.4 million (June 30, 2021: $0.5\nmillion) and recognized an interest expense of $3.2 million (2021: $3.4 million). There\nhas been no re-measurement of lease liabilities during the year (2021: Nil).\n16.

The reserve is not available for distribution\nbut can be utilized as stipulated by the Bahrain Commercial Companies Law.\nFair value reserve\nCertain of the Group’s PE, RE, ARI, CM and strategic investments in equity instruments\nand certain CM debt instruments have been classified as FVOCI. The gains and losses\narising on fair valuation of such investments is recorded in the fair value reserve\naccount. Any gain or loss on realization of such PE, RE, ARI, other strategic investments\nand CM equity instruments is recycled directly to retained earnings and any gain or loss\non realization of such CM debt instruments is recycled to retained earnings through profit\nor loss.\nTreasury shares\n865,443 (2021: 673,305) ordinary shares were held as treasury shares, which includes\n10,550 shares (2021: 22,823 shares) that have been granted to employees as part of\ndeferred remuneration but have not yet started vesting. 2,303,438 shares (2021:\n2,422,972 shares) that have been granted to employees and have commenced vesting,\nbut have not fully vested as at 2022, are not counted as treasury shares.\nDuring the year, as part of the delisting process, the Company re-purchased 6.1 million\nshares from its shareholders for a total consideration of $70 million. Further,\napproximately 4.2 million shares (2021: 7.6 million shares) were purchased by the\nmanagement for a total consideration of approximately $46 million (2021: $76.4 million).\nThe book value of the shares approximated the fair value of the shares.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17. SHARE CAPITAL AND RESERVES (CONTINUED)\nPreference share capital\nThe Series B preference shares are non-cumulative, non-convertible, non-voting, non-\nparticipating and perpetual in nature and carry a floating rate dividend, equal to the\nbenchmark 12-month interbank rate + 9.75% per annum. The Series B preference\nshares are callable at any time, at the Company’s option, in part or in whole at par plus\ndividends due up to the call date.\nThe Series E preference shares are fixed rate, equal to 8%, resettable, non-cumulative,\nwith no fixed maturity date and are redeemable at Investcorp’s option only after five and\na half years from date of issuance.\nThe payment of dividends on preference shares is subject to recommendation by the\nBoard of Directors, and approval by the ordinary shareholders. The preference shares\ntake priority over the Company’s ordinary shares for payment of dividends and\ndistribution of assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution.\nShare premium\nShare premium includes any gain or loss on purchase or sale of Company’s shares\nincluding treasury shares. Movement in share premium during the year includes loss of\n$4 million (2021: loss of $12 million) on vesting of treasury shares, $17 million (2021: Nil)\nrelating to performance share awards vesting and $3 million relating to the purchase of\nshares by employees (2021: Nil).\nOther Reserves\nOther reserves consist of cash flow hedges and the revaluation reserve on premises and\nequipment recognized directly in equity.\nMovements relating to other reserves are set out below:\nRevaluation\nreserve on\nCash flow Total\npremises and\n$millions hedges\nequipment\nBalance at June 30, 2020 (9) 4 (5)\nNet realized gain recycled to statement of profit or loss 2 - 2\nNet unrealized gain for the year 0 - 0\nTransfer of depreciation to retained earnings - ( 0) (0)\nBalance at June 30, 2021 (7) 4 (3)\nNet realized loss recycled to statement of profit or loss (5) - ( 5)\nNet unrealized gain for the year 0 - 0\nTransfer of depreciation to retained earnings - ( 0) ( 0)\nBalance at June 30, 2022 (12) 4 (8)\n34 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n18.

In addition, an interim dividend of $5\nmillion was also paid on October 2021.\nThe book value per ordinary share at the year-end date is calculated by dividing the\nordinary shareholders’ equity (excluding unrealized changes relating to cash flow\nhedges, the revaluation reserve and proposed appropriations) by the number of ordinary\nshares outstanding at year end (taking into account the beneficial interest of\nmanagement in all acquired unvested shares issued at year end). The fully diluted book\nvalue per ordinary share is $11.31 per share (2021: $10.81 per share).\n20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Group’s management classifies hedges into two categories: (a) fair value hedges\nthat hedge exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability; and (b)\ncash flow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a\nparticular risk associated with either a recognized asset or liability or a forecasted\ntransaction highly probable to occur.\nOther derivatives\nThe Group does not actively engage in proprietary trading activities in derivatives.\nHowever, on occasion, the Group may need to undertake certain derivative transactions\nto mitigate economic risks under its asset-liability management and risk management\nguidelines that may not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 (e.g. hedging of\nforeign currency risk on fair valued investments). Consequently, gains or losses resulting\nfrom the re-measurement to fair value of these derivatives are taken to the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\nValuation of derivatives\nThe Group values the majority of its derivative financial instruments using internal\nmodels. The models use market observable inputs including interest rate curves and\nboth forward and spot prices for currencies. Derivative assets and liabilities included in\nLevel 2 (see Note 23) represent interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, currency\nforwards and option contracts. For derivatives that are not valued using internal models,\nthe Group’s policy is to rely on third party valuations, whilst benchmarking them against\nobservable market data.\nThe Group's outstanding derivative financial instruments comprise the following:\n2022 2021\nNotional Positive fair Negative Notional Positive fair Negative fair\n$millions value value* fair value value value* value\nA) DERIVATIVES WHERE HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS APPLIED\nCurrency risk being hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts\ni) Fair value hedges\nOn balance sheet exposures 290 - (33) 338 - (7)\nii) Cash flow hedges\nForecasted transactions 29 2 (0) 33 1 (0)\nCoupon on long-term debt 45 - (5) 42 - (1)\nTotal forward foreign exchange contracts 364 2 (38) 413 1 (8)\nInterest rate risk being hedged using interest rate swaps\ni) Fair value hedges - fixed rate debt 332 41 (1) 397 25 -\nii) Cash flow hedges - floating rate debt 25 - (0) 25 - (3)\nTotal interest rate hedging contracts 357 41 (1) 422 25 (3)\nTotal hedging derivatives 721 43 (39) 835 26 (11)\nB) DERIVATIVES WHERE HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NOT APPLIED\nInterest rate swaps 225 6 (8) 475 14 (12)\nForward rate agreements 17 0 (0) 4 0 (0)\nForward foreign exchange contracts 1,418 17 (11) 1,453 6 (4)\nCurrency options 12 0 - 43 - (3)\nFutures 17 0 - 16 - (0)\nTotal other derivatives 1,689 23 (19) 1,991 20 (19)\nTOTAL - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 2,410 66 (58) 2,826 46 (30)\n* Net collateral received by the Group amounting to $2 million has been taken against the fair values above (2021: $48.9 million).\n36 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n20.

The litigation cases\ninvolve claims made by and against the Group which have arisen in the ordinary course\nof business. The management of the Group, after reviewing the claims pending against\nthe Group companies and based on the advice of the relevant professional legal\nadvisors, are satisfied that the outcome of these claims will not have a material adverse\neffect on the financial position of the Group. Further, a tax query has been raised in\nrelation to certain co-investments of the Group. The Group does not expect any likely\nclaim to arise in respect of this matter. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk management is an integral part of the Group’s corporate decision-making process.\nThe Financial and Risk Management Committee (FRMC) oversees the Group’s risk\nmanagement activities, and sets the Group’s risk profile on an enterprise wide basis.\nThe FRMC is comprised of members of senior management drawn from all key areas of\nthe Group.\nThe Group’s primary risk management objective is to support its business objectives\nwith sufficient economic capital. The Group employs risk models to determine the capital\nneeded to cover unexpected losses from investment or other risks. This capital amount\nis known as economic capital. The economic capital requirement for each reporting\nsegment is determined for a one year horizon and subsequently aggregated to\ndetermine the total economic capital. This total economic capital is then stress tested\nunder a dynamic VaR approach. The dynamic VaR is calculated by using a five-year\nplanning horizon, a 99% one-tailed confidence level and by recognizing diversification\nbenefits across asset classes.\nIn addition to determining an adequate economic capital allocation for each reporting\nsegment, the risk management team has developed tools in conjunction with risk\nmanagement consultants to perform detailed risk analyses that specifically address the\ninvestment risks in each individual line of business.\nThe principal risks associated with the Group’s business, and the related risk\nmanagement processes are explained below:\ni) Counterparty credit risk\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on its short term funds, placements, fair\nvalue of derivatives, receivables, advances, debt investments and guarantees. The\nGroup manages counterparty credit risk by setting limits for all counterparties. The Group\nalso monitors credit exposures, and continually assesses the creditworthiness of\ncounterparties. Counterparty credit risk in respect of derivative financial instruments is\nlimited to those with positive fair values. With respect to the counterparty credit risk\nexposure arising from other financial assets, the Group has a maximum exposure equal\nto the carrying value of these instruments. The Group also actively attempts to mitigate\ncounterparty credit risks, where possible, through documented netting and margin\narrangements with counterparties, under ISDA and CSA agreements.\nThe risk management team maintains an overall external rating-based methodology for\nsetting Board approved counterparty limits. For rated counterparties, credit ratings from\nat least two rating agencies are used for developing counterparty limits. All non-rated\ncounterparties are screened through due diligence and credit analysis prior to the\nassumption of credit exposures to them by Investcorp. These non-rated counterparties\nare also categorized under the ‘Standard’ internal rating for financial reporting purposes.\n40 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\ni) Counterparty credit risk (continued)\nThe table below shows the relationship between the internal rating* and the category of\nthe external rating grades:\nInternal Rating External Rating by S & P and Moody’s\nHigh AAA to A\nStandard A- to B-\n* The internal rating is used to determine provisions and impairments for financial\nreporting purposes.\nInternal rating categories are summarized as follows:\nHigh - there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full and collateral\nmay be available.\nStandard – whilst there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore,\nrepresents low risk to the Group, the asset may not be collateralized.\nCounterparty credit risk exposure is considered as past due when payment is due\naccording to the contractual terms but is not received. During the current and previous\nyear, none of the advances (refer note 8) were restructured.\nThe table below analyses the Group’s maximum counterparty credit risk exposures at\nyear end without taking into account any credit mitigants.\nMaximum\nJune 30, 2022\nStage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Provisions credit risk\n$millions\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (a+b+c+d)\nCredit risk rating\nHigh Standard\nShort-term funds, placements and other\nliquid assets 160 89 - - ( 0) 249\nPositive fair value of derivatives 36 30 - - - 66\nReceivables - 237 5 1 ( 3) 240\nAdvances - 222 25 3 ( 11) 239\nCo-investments - debt - 191 - - - 191\nTotal 196 769 30 4 ( 14) 985\nMaximum\nJune 30, 2021\nStage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Provisions credit risk\n$millions\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (a+b+c+d)\nCredit risk rating\nHigh Standard\nShort-term funds, placements and other\nliquid assets 231 58 - - (0) 289\nPositive fair value of derivatives 25 21 - - - 46\nReceivables - 368 3 2 (4) 369\nAdvances - 284 28 3 (11) 304\nCo-investments - debt - 252 - - - 252\nTotal 256 983 31 5 (15) 1,260\n41 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22.

The Group also acts as an\noriginator and sponsor for certain CLO investments and co-invests through specific\nSPVs in the CLO investments. The CLO investments are held within a business model\nwhose objective is to hold and sell assets in order to collect contractual cash flows on\nspecified dates. The contractual terms give rise to variable distributions (solely payments\nof principal and interest) based on CLO’s respective waterfall and priorities of payment.\nThe Group manages its risk relevant to the securitization activity in line with its risk\nmanagement policies and procedures.\nThe Group’s securitization exposures through the CLOs are in the rated and unrated\ntranches of the notes and varies from fund to fund. The Group does not hold\nsecuritization positions with trading intent or to hedge positions with trading intent. The\nGroup has not established and does not manage any synthetic securitization structures\nnor does it securitize revolving exposures.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nii) Credit Risk Measurement\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nWhen determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable\ninformation that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both\nquantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical\nexperience, expert credit assessment and forward-looking information.\nAs a practical expedient, IFRS 9 provides a low credit risk (‘LCR’) operational\nsimplification that if a financial instrument has low credit risk i.e. an investment grade\ncredit rating, an entity is allowed to assume at the reporting date that no significant\nincrease in credit risk has occurred.\nThe Group considers financial instruments with an external rating grade of ‘investment\ngrade’ as LCR for the short-term liquid asset portfolio.\nThe receivables and advances of the Group are collateralized by the underlying\ninvestments. Hence, the Group considers fair-value movements of such investments and\nmanagement judgement to assess whether there has been a significant increase in\ncredit risk for its receivables and advances portfolio.\nMeasurement of ECL\nThe Group measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default\n(EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). PD represents the likelihood of a borrower\ndefaulting on its financial obligation. EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to\nbe owed at the time of default. LGD represents the group’s expectation of the extent of\nloss on the exposure.\nFor the short-term liquid asset portfolio, external rating agency credit grades are used.\nThese published grades are continuously monitored and updated. The PDs associated\nwith each grade are determined based on realized default rates over the period of 12\nmonths, as published by the rating agencies, after adjusting for forward-looking macro-\neconomic information.\nFor receivables and advances that arise in connection with the PE asset class, PDs are\nderived using an internal model and adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic\ninformation. PDs for receivables and advances of the RE asset class are derived based\non internal categorization of the related investment and default rates published by a\nreputable rating agency adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic information.\nFor secured assets, LGDs are determined based on factors which impact the recoveries\nmade post default. For unsecured assets, LGDs are based on regulatory guidelines.\nThe Group writes-off exposures if there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n43 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\niii) Funding liquidity risk\nFunding liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to fund increases in assets\nand meet obligations when they fall due, without incurring unacceptable losses. To\nmitigate this risk, the Group implements a comprehensive liquidity risk management\nframework, which includes the use of risk limits, monitoring systems and scenario\nanalyses that are incorporated into a contingency funding plan. The framework is subject\nto Board and senior management oversight. Liquidity management aims to arrange\ndiversified funding sources and maintain comfortable and laddered debt maturities. The\nGroup manages assets with liquidity in mind, and it monitors liquidity on a daily basis.\nThe table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group’s assets and liabilities\nbased on expected realizations.\n44 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22.

RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\niii) Funding liquidity risk (continued)\nContractual maturity of financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis\nThe table below presents the cash flows payable by the Group relating to its financial\nliabilities and derivatives upon their respective earliest contractual maturities at the\nstatement of financial position date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the\ncontractual undiscounted cash flows (i.e. nominal plus interest) determined by using the\nforward yield curve to calculate future floating rate cash flows for the relevant periods.\n46 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\niv) Concentration risk\nConcentration risk arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar\nbusiness activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic\nfeatures that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly\naffected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate\nthe relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular\nindustry or geographic location. The Group’s policies and procedures and the broad\ngeographical and industry spread of its activities limit its exposure to any concentration\nrisk. Additionally management has established credit limits for geographic and\ncounterparty exposures, which are regularly monitored.\nThe distribution of assets and off-balance sheet items by geographical region and\nindustry sector is as follows:\n47 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nv) Market price risk\nThe principal market related risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign currency\nrisk, interest rate risk and equity price risk associated with its co-investments in absolute\nreturn investments, private equity investments, strategic capital investments, strategic\ninvestments, credit management investments and real estate investments, as well as on\nits debt financings. For the purpose of managing market price risks, the Group has\nestablished appropriate procedures and limits approved by the Board of Directors.\nIn addition, for internal risk assessments, the Group uses a variety of internal and\nexternal models to analyze the market price risks that may arise from adverse market\nmovements.\nMarket price risk has been further detailed below under (a) foreign currency risk, (b)\ninterest rate risk and (c) equity price risk.\nv) (a) Foreign currency risk\nThe Group’s overall policy is generally to hedge all non-US dollar denominated assets,\nliabilities and commitments, and a proportion of its assets denominated in US-pegged\ncurrencies, into US dollars utilizing currency risk management products. In the normal\ncourse of its business, the Group utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and other\nforeign exchange derivatives to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange\nrates. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and hedging strategies are used to\nensure positions are maintained within established exposure and Value at Risk (“VaR”)\nrisk limits.\nThe Group’s significant net hedged and unhedged foreign currency positions are set out\nbelow.\n48 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nv) Market price risk (continued)\nv) (a) Foreign currency risk (continued)\nIncidental unhedged positions are subjected to market risk calculation based on their\nVaR. VaR estimates the potential loss due to market movement of foreign exchange\nrates or volatility of those rates. Potential market movements of foreign exchange rates\nare derived from a study of their historical volatility. The risk methodology is based on\nthe assumption that changes in foreign exchange rates follow a normal probability\ndistribution over time. The characteristics of normal distribution are then used to assess\nportfolio risk. However, the Group’s risk management team conducts back testing by\ncomparing the daily VaR with the daily profit and loss to ensure the robustness of the\nVaR model.\nThe following table summarizes the 99% confidence level over a 1-day holding period\nVaR for the Group’s foreign currency exposures.\nThe foreign exchange loss recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a\nresult of incidental unhedged positions and costs of hedging against foreign exchange\nrisk amounts to $1.8 million (2021: $1.9 million).\nv) (b) Interest rate risk\nThe Group closely monitors interest rate movements, and seeks to limit its exposure to\nsuch movements by managing the interest rate repricing structure of its assets and\nliabilities. The Group actively manages its interest rate repricing gap exposure, with a\nbias towards floating rates and with exposure limits that are approved by the Board of\nDirectors. The Group does not take interest rate trading positions and all of its interest\nrate risk is typically in the Company’s book where hedge accounting applies. The Group\nalso utilizes interest rate related derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure\nto fluctuations in interest rates for specific transactions or groups of transactions.\nA majority of the Group's interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities carry\nfloating rates of interest or if they carry fixed rates they have been hedged to floating\nrates of interest, except for the following:\n• Credit management Investments amounting to $206 million (June 30, 2021: $255\nmillion), which earn interest at an effective rate ranging between 2.5% to 14.7%\n(June 30, 2021: 2.5% to 14.7%) per annum.\nThe Group is currently assessing the impact of transition away from Libor on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\n49 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nv) Market price risk (continued)\nv) (b) Interest rate risk (continued)\nThe following table depicts the sensitivity of the Group's net income to a 200 basis points\nchange in interest rates, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity is based\non the floating rate financial assets and financial liabilities (including items hedged back\nto floating rate) held at the year end.\nPotentially significant variances in interest rate sensitivity may exist at dates other than\nthe year end.\n50 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nv) Market price risk (continued)\nv) (c) Equity price risk\nThe Group’s equity price risk arises primarily from its co-investments in private equity\ninvestment, real estate investment, strategic capital investment and absolute return\ninvestments.\nThe Group manages the equity price risk of its co-investments in private equity\ninvestment, strategic capital, absolute return investments and real estate investment on\na portfolio basis as well as at the individual investment level.\nThe table below summarizes the sensitivity of the Group’s co-investments in PE, RE,\nARI, SC and other investments to changes in multiples / capitalization rates / discount\nrates/ quoted bid prices.\n51 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nvi) Operational risk\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems or from external events (such as natural disasters,\nchanges in regulation or outsourcing of operations). Investcorp includes in this definition\nlegal risk but excludes reputational and strategic risks.\nWhile operational risks cannot be entirely eliminated, they are managed and mitigated\nby ensuring that appropriate infrastructure, controls, systems, procedures and trained\nand competent people are in place throughout Investcorp. The internal audit department\nmakes regular, independent appraisals of the control environment in all identified risk\nareas. Contingency arrangements, which are tested from time to time, are also in place\nto support operations in the event of a range of possible disaster scenarios. In addition,\nInvestcorp carries errors and omissions insurance against legal risks arising from its\nbusiness activities.\nInvestcorp applies the Basic Indicator Approach (‘BIA’) to measure operational risk and\nalso is implementing a Board of Directors approved operational risk management\nframework. Under the BIA approach, the operational risk charge is calculated by taking\nInvestcorp’s average gross income over the preceding two years and current financial\nyear and multiplying it by a fixed alpha coefficient (15 per cent). The operational risk\nmanagement framework consists of the following: 1) “Risk Control and Self-\nAssessment”: Self-assess operational risks by going through key business processes\nend-to-end, 2) Evaluate the adequacy of existing process controls, 3) Implement control\nmodifications to reduce operational risks and determine residual risks and 4) Monitor\nand report operational risk events to senior management and the Board.\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair\nvalue measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or\ntransfer the liability takes place either:\n• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or\n• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability, on the basis that market\nparticipants act in their economic best interest.\n52 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe Group has established guidelines for the valuation of its investments which are\nreviewed by the Board of Directors and abides by guidelines issued under IFRS on\nvaluation of investments and guidelines recommended by the International Private\nEquity and Venture Capital Association. The Group performs valuations of its\ninvestments on a quarterly basis. The business support teams work along with deal\nteams to prepare valuation packages in accordance with the valuation guidelines of the\nGroup. The valuation packages are then presented to the Valuation Committee which is\ncomprised of senior members of the Finance team and investing lines of business. The\nValuation Committee has the final responsibility of reviewing and approving the fair value\nof all investments.\nUnderlying the definition of fair value is the presumption that the Group is a going\nconcern without any intention or requirement to curtail materially the scale of its\noperations or to undertake a transaction on adverse terms.\nFair value adjustments arise from re-measurement of liabilities which are hedged,\ninvestments and derivatives.\nNonetheless the actual amount that is realized in a future transaction may differ from the\ncurrent estimate of fair value, given the inherent uncertainty surrounding valuations of\nunquoted investments.\nThe fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different\nfrom their carrying values except for certain assets and liabilities carried at amortized\ncost. The fair value of CLO co-investments carried at amortized cost amounts to $101.1\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $145.6 million) as compared to the carrying value of $101.9\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $145.3 million). The fair value of CLO co-investments is based\non inputs from independent third parties and falls under Level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy disclosure. The fair value of medium and long term debt amounts to $350\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $414.8 million) as compared to the carrying value of $359.5\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $417.4 million). The fair value of medium and long term debt is\nbased on inputs from third party banks and falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\ndescribed below.\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of\nfinancial instruments:\nLevel 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability,\neither directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\nLevel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e.\nunobservable inputs).\nDuring the current financial year, there was no transfer between levels (June 30, 2021:\n$6.9 million). Under absolute return investments, an exposure of $4 million (June 30,\n2021: $5.3 million) is comprised of illiquid side pocket investments which are classified\nas Level 3. The year to date fair value changes on this ARI exposure amounts to a loss\nof $0.3 million (June 30, 2021: gain of $0.6 million) and the net redemptions amount to\n$0.9 million (June 30, 2021: $1 million).\n53 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe fair values of financial assets that are traded in active markets are based on quoted\nmarket prices or dealer price quotations. For all other financial instruments, the Group\ndetermines fair values using other valuation techniques which are explained in Notes 10\nand 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table shows an analysis of financial instruments recorded at fair value by\nlevel of the fair value hierarchy:\n54 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\nA reconciliation of the opening and closing amounts of Level 3 co-investment in private\nequity investment, real estate investment, credit management investment, strategic\ncapital investment, investment in joint ventures and other strategic investments is given\nbelow:\n24. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION\nInvestcorp has a clear and well-defined “pay for risk-adjusted long-term performance”\nphilosophy that pervades its culture and motivates its employees to target delivery of\nconsistent top-quartile performance. This philosophy is exhibited in Investcorp’s\nremuneration programs and it is reflected in its annual remuneration decisions.\nThe remuneration that is paid to Investcorp’s employees is divided into two fundamental\ncomponents: (i) fixed remuneration, i.e., salary and benefits, and (ii) variable\nremuneration.\nVariable remuneration, comprised of cash and awards under deferred remuneration\nprograms, is remuneration that varies from year to year and the amount of which is\ndependent upon (i) the financial performance of Investcorp as a whole, (ii) the risk-\nadjusted performance of each employee’s respective line of business and (iii) the\nperformance of the individual employee.\n55 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nInvestcorp extensively utilizes deferred remuneration programs as part of employees’\nremuneration. These programs are comprised of investment carried interest and co-\ninvestment programs and share-linked programs as described briefly below.\nPrograms for Investment Profit Participation\nThe Group’s investment professionals in its private equity investment, real estate\ninvestment and investment relationship management lines of business participate in\ninvestment carried interest programs, whereby a certain variable portion of exit proceeds\ndue to investors from realization of their investments is shared with these professionals,\nprovided certain pre-established minimum client return hurdles are satisfied. Netting\nmechanisms are used so that returns from investments that perform well are netted\nagainst other investments in which losses are sustained. Since this carry is awarded up\nfront at the time of acquisition it has no significant value at the time of the award.\nPrograms for Investment Participation\nInvestment professionals and relationship managers also participate in a co-investment\nprogram pursuant to which they acquire an interest in the Investcorp Group’s\ninvestments that they manage at the Investcorp Group’s Consolidated Statement of\nFinancial Position carrying value, thereby resulting in no gain or loss to Investcorp\nexcept for any potential impairment losses on the financing provided.\nUnder certain legacy co-investment programs, the Group provided financing at market\nrates to or on behalf of eligible employees, to invest in these programs on a levered\nbasis. The permissible levels of leverage varied on a product to product and program to\nprogram basis. The aggregate remaining amount of such financing provided to or on\nbehalf of employees as of June 30, 2022 is $1.5 million (June 30, 2021: $2.3 million).\nA portion of the deferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is also in the form\nof co-investment exposures. These awards have different vesting conditions and are not\ntransferable. An expense charge of $8 million (2021: $10 million) was taken by the\nGroup based on management’s best estimate of the likely vesting of the awards.\nEmployee Share-Linked Plans\nSHL sponsors various employee share-linked plans under which a portion of the\ndeferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is in the form of SIPCO shares or\nphantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based awards that\nrepresent a beneficial interest in the ordinary shares of the Company. These SIPCO\nawards have different vesting periods and are not transferable.\nSIPCO shares or phantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based\nawards are granted to the employees at their fair value on the grant date. The fair value\nof SIPCO shares for purposes of the plans is estimated considering their non-\ntransferability and the indirect nature of the underlying beneficial ownership. The value of\nSIPCO shares granted during the year is $21.3 million (2021: $30.2 million). The start\nand end date of the vesting period for each grant varies from plan to plan and is based\non continued employment (unless employment is terminated due to death, disability or\nretirement) as well as satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The determination\nof the amount of expense to be recognized as compensation expense in any year is\nestimated based on a model that takes into account the probability weighted vesting of\nthe shares at the fair value on the grant date using the historical pattern of employee\ntenure. These estimates are updated regularly based on actual information.\n56 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nAn expense charge of $18.4 million (2021: $16.2 million) was taken by the Group based\non management’s best estimate of the number of shares that are likely to vest. The grant\ndate value of shares vested during the year amounted to $20.9 million (2021: $19\nmillion). The details of shares granted, vested and forfeited during the year are as\nfollows:\nThe fair value of shares granted during the year amounted to $21.3 million (2021: $30.2\nmillion). The fair value of shares forfeited during the year amounted to $1.6 million\n(2021: $1.7 million).\n25. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\nFor the Group, related parties include its investee companies, companies that hold\nclients’ investments (investment holding companies), client fund companies associated\nwith ARI, SIPCO Limited and the Trusts.\nIt also includes major shareholders, directors and senior management of the Company,\ntheir immediate families and entities controlled, jointly controlled or significantly\ninfluenced by such parties. Income is earned or expense is incurred in the Group’s\ntransactions with such related parties in the ordinary course of business. The Group’s\nmanagement approves the terms and conditions of all related party transactions.\nAlthough these companies are classified as related parties, the Group administers and\nmanages the companies that hold clients’ investments on a fiduciary basis on behalf of\nits clients who are third parties and are the beneficiaries of a majority of the economic\ninterest from the underlying investments of these companies. As a result, the true nature\nof the Group’s transactions with these companies is effectively at commercial terms as\nspecified under pre-determined management agreements.\nIn addition to the compensation and benefits to employees disclosed in Note 24, the\nincome earned and expenses incurred in connection with related party transactions\nincluded in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:\n57 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n25. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES (CONTINUED)\nOf the staff compensation set out in Note 24, $110 million (2021: $87 million) is\nattributable to senior management. Of the above mentioned remuneration of senior\nmanagement, $82.6 million (2021: $64.3 million) is in the form of salaries and other short\nterm benefits.\nIn addition to the compensation and benefits to employees disclosed in Note 24, the\nbalances with related parties included in these consolidated financial statements are as\nfollows:\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), in conformity with the Bahrain\nCommercial Companies Law.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in United States\ndollars, this being the functional currency of the Group, and rounded to the nearest\nmillions ($millions) unless otherwise stated. Certain prior year balances have been\nreclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no\nimpact on the net loss or equity of the Group.\nThe Group has adopted the below listed amendments to standards effective from July 1,\n2021. The adoption of these amendments did not have any material impact on the\nconsolidated financial statements of the Group.\n• Amendments to IFRS 4, IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 39 – Phase 2 of\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform.\nWhile some of the Group's financial instruments are subject to IBOR reforms at\n30 June 2022 and have not yet transitioned out of the current IBOR to ARR, the\nGroup has already made substantial progress to finalize the transition from IBOR\nto the new ARR. Several milestones have been completed, such as the upgrade\nof the technology systems to handle the new reference rate, review of significant\nthe Group’s internal documents and planning to amend documentation for\nexisting contracts such as the existing Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group\nexpects to have the full transition implemented by June 2023.\n58 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nNew standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective\n• Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (issued May\n2020, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments to IAS 16 - Proceeds before Intended Use (issued May 2020,\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\n(issued May 2020, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2022);\n• Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 -\n2020 - effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022;\n• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued May 2017; effective for annual periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2023);\n• Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n(issued January 2020; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1\nJanuary 2023);\n• Amendments to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued February 2021;\neffective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2023); and\n• Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of Accounting\nPolicies (issued February 2021; effective for annual period beginning on or after\n1 January 2023).\nThe Group’s management is currently evaluating the impact of the above standard and\namendments on the consolidated financial statements.\ni) Accounting convention\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention\nexcept for the re-measurement at fair value of financial instruments under IFRS 9 and\nrevaluation of premises and equipment.\nii) Going concern\nThe Group’s management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going\nconcern and is satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in business\nfor the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material\nuncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared\non a going concern basis.\n59 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\niii) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are comprised of the financial statements of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity which is controlled by the Group.\nControl is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns\nthrough its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through\nits power over the entity. The Group consolidates its subsidiaries excluding entities\nwhich meet the below criteria:\na) Where there are contractual or other restrictions imposed on the Group’s ability\nto appoint the majority of the Board of Directors, or\nb) Where a majority of the economic risk and reward accrues to third parties other\nthan the Group, or\nc) Where the exception to consolidate subsidiaries of an Investment entity is\napplied, as defined in IFRS 10.\nThe Group qualifies as an investment entity as defined under IFRS 10, and as such,\nmeasures its investments in accordance with the requirements set out in the standard.\nThe results of all subsidiaries are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss\nfrom the effective date of formation or acquisition. The financial statements of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company,\nusing consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances, income and expenses\nhave been eliminated on consolidation.\niv) Business Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an\nacquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is\nmeasured at acquisition date fair value. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as\nincurred.\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities\nassumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the\ncontractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition\ndate.\nv) Trade date accounting\nPurchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery of the assets within a\ntimeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place are\nrecognized using the “trade date” accounting basis (i.e. the date that the entity commits\nto purchase or sell the asset).\nvi) Offsetting\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable\nright to offset the recognized amounts and the Group intends to settle on a net basis.\n60 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nvii) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of financial assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates is principally\nlimited to:\na) The determination of the fair values of FVTPL investments in private equity co-\ninvestments, credit management co-investments, strategic capital co-\ninvestments, real estate co-investments, other strategic investments (see Note\n10), and investment in SPACs (Note 9), the determination of performance fees\non assets under management, impairment provisions for financial assets other\nthan FVTPL investments and FVOCI equity investments (see Note 13) and\nallocation of placement fee to the performance obligations as described later.\nb) The determination of performance fees on assets under management are\ndependent on the performance of the underlying investments and thus are\nhighly susceptible to factors outside the Group’s influence\nc) The determination of cash flows which is the basis for performing the\nassessment of solely payments of principal and interest test on CLO co-\ninvestments which are being carried as debt instruments at amortized cost (see\nNote 10).\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made\njudgments covered in the following section, apart from those involving estimates, which\nhave the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe valuation approach was substantially consistent with our normal process and\nvaluation policy. A key focus of the portfolio fair value was an assessment of the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on each investment. The approach considered the\nperformance of each investment exposure before the outbreak of COVID-19, the\nprojected short-term impact on their ability to generate earnings and cash flow and also\nlonger-term view of their ability to recover and perform against their investment cases.\nGiven the diversity of the portfolio, the impact has been varied, based on type of\nunderlying exposure, industry exposure, expected recovery from the current crisis and\ncurrent market inputs.\n61 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nviii) Foreign currencies\nA foreign currency transaction is recorded in the functional currency at the rate of\nexchange prevailing at the value date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities\nin foreign currencies that are held at the reporting date are retranslated at market rates\nof exchange prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under treasury and other\nincome.\nNon-monetary assets that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies\nare recorded at rates of exchange prevailing at the value dates of the transactions. Non-\nmonetary assets in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated at\nexchange rates prevailing on the dates the fair values were determined. Gains and\nlosses on fair valuation of FVTPL investments are taken to the consolidated statement of\nprofit or loss.\nForeign currency differences arising from the translation of investments in respect of\nwhich an election has been made to present subsequent changes in FVOCI are\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.\nix) Income\nInterest income is recognized using the effective yield of the asset and is recorded as\nasset based income. Asset based income from all co-investments classified as FVTPL\ninvestments is recognized on the basis of realized and unrealized changes in fair value\nas at the end of the reporting period.\nFee income is recognized when services are rendered. Performance fees are\nrecognized when earned. Performance fees are only recognized once it is highly\nprobable that there would be no significant reversal of any accumulated revenue in the\nfuture. Estimates are needed to assess the risk that achieved earnings may be reversed\nbefore realization due to the risk of lower future overall performance of the underlying\ninvestments. The reversal risk is managed through adjustments of the unrealized\ninvestment values by imposing discounts depending on specific investment risks and on\nthe expected average remaining holding period of the investment.\nIncome from SPAC transactions is recorded on the basis of realized and unrealized\nchanges in the fair value of interest held in the respective SPACs and is included within\ntransaction and advisory income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nRealized capital gains or losses on FVOCI equity investments are taken to retained\nearnings at the time of derecognition of the investment.\nPlacement fees are charged when an underwritten investment is placed with investors.\nThe Group has identified the performance obligations arising from its contracts with\ninvestors with whom the investments are placed. The portion of the fee relating to such\nperformance obligations is deferred and recognized over the investment period.\n62 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nInvestcorp has reviewed and analyzed the terms of the contracts that it has entered into\nwith its investors arising from the placement of its investments. Based on this review,\nthe Group has determined the following two types of performance obligations that\nInvestcorp is expected to satisfy:\ni. services provided by Investcorp during the year from purchase to the placement of\nthe investment with investors, including deal identification, funding, underwriting,\nmaintaining a placement infrastructure, preparing the marketing materials for each\ndeal etc; and\nii. services provided over the period of the investment as agreed with the investor at the\ntime of placement.\nInvestcorp has allocated the placement fee to each of the above performance\nobligations. The Group completes all of its performance obligations described in (i)\nabove before placing an investment with its investors. Accordingly, the fee relating to\nthis performance obligation is recognized upfront upon placement of the investment\nwith investors. This portion of the placement fee is included as part of deal fees except\nfor placement fee from program clients which is included as part of AUM fees.\nA portion of the placement fee represents the amount received upfront for the\nperformance obligation described in (ii) above. Accordingly, this component of the\nplacement fee is deferred and recognized over time, as AUM fees, over the period of\nmanaging the investment.\nx) Interest expenses\nInterest on borrowings represents funding cost and is calculated using the effective\ninterest rate method, adjusted for gains or losses on related cash flow hedges.\nxi) Taxation of foreign operations\nThere is no tax on corporate income in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Taxation on income\nfrom foreign subsidiaries is provided for in accordance with the fiscal regulations of the\ncountries in which the respective Group entities operate.\nDeferred taxation is provided for using the liability method on all temporary differences\ncalculated at the rate at which it is expected to be payable. Deferred tax assets are only\nrecognized if recovery is probable.\nxii) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term funds, cash in transit, other\nliquid funds and placements with financial institutions that are readily convertible into\ncash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.\nxiii) Receivables\nSubscription receivables are recognized when the obligation is established, i.e., when a\nbinding subscription agreement is signed. These are carried at cost less provision for\nimpairment.\n63 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nxiv) Advances\nAdvances are stated at amortized cost, net of any impairment provisions.\nxv) Classification of financial assets\n(a) Investments\nThe group classifies the financial assets into various categories as set out in Note 4.\nOn initial investment, a debt investment is measured at amortized cost if the financial\nasset is held to collect contractual cash flows over the life of the asset and if those cash\nflows comprise solely of principal repayments and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding.\nThe Group also classifies certain strategic investments, real estate co-investment,\nprivate equity co-investments, strategic capital co-investments, credit management\ninvestments and ARI investments as FVOCI investments.\nAll other investments including those over which the Group has significant influence are\nclassified as FVTPL.\n(b) Other liquid assets\nOther liquid assets, which form part of “placements with financial institutions and other\nliquid assets”, are recorded at amortized cost less any impairment in value other than\nthose assets which contain embedded derivatives requiring either separation of the\nembedded derivative or classification of the entire instrument as FVTPL assets. The\nmanagement has designated such assets as FVTPL assets.\nxvi) Co-investments\na. Co- investments in private equity investment and real estate investment\nThe Group’s co-investments in private equity investment and real estate investment are\nclassified as FVTPL and FVOCI investments. FVTPL investments are initially recorded\nat acquisition cost (being the initial fair value) and are re-measured to fair value at each\nreporting date, with resulting unrealized gains or losses being recorded as fair value\nchanges in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Consequently, there are no\nimpairment provisions for such investments.\nFVOCI investments are initially recorded at fair value. These investments are then re-\nmeasured to fair value at each reporting date and any resulting change in value of these\ninvestments is taken to the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income and\nrecorded as a separate component of equity until they are derecognized at which time\nthe cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is transferred to retained\nearnings.\nb. Co- investments in credit management investment\nThe Group’s co-investments in credit management and any new exposure acquired\nduring the year are classified as FVOCI debt investments. All other credit management\nco-investment exposures are carried at amortised cost less any impairment provision.\nInterest income on amortized cost instruments is recognized using the effective interest\nrate (“EIR”).\n64 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nFVOCI debt investments are initially recorded at fair value. Any subsequent fair value\nchanges on such investments will be recognized directly in equity and any impairment in\nthe carrying value will be recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. At\nthe time of derecognition, any cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is\ntransferred to retained earnings through profit or loss. The fair value changes in FVTPL\ninvestments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nAny revision of estimated future cash flows are discounted at the original EIR with a\nconsequential adjustment to the carrying amount and a corresponding increase or\ndecrease in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nc. Co-investments in absolute return investments\nThe Group’s co-investments in absolute return investments are classified as FVTPL and\nFVOCI investments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date. The fair value\nchanges in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or\nloss.\nThe fair value changes in the FVOCI investments are taken to the consolidated\nstatement of other comprehensive income and recorded as a separate component of\nequity until they are derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously\nreported is transferred to retained earnings.\nd. Co- investments in strategic capital investment\nThe Group’s co-investments in strategic capital investments are classified as FVTPL\ninvestments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date. The fair value changes in\nFVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\ne. Investment in structured products\nThe Group’s investments in structured products are classified as FVTPL and are stated\nat fair value at the reporting date. The fair value changes in FVTPL investments are\nrecorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nf. Investment in other strategic investments\nThe Group’s investments in other strategic investments are classified as FVTPL and\nFVOCI investments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date. The fair value\nchanges in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or\nloss.\nThe fair value changes in the FVOCI investments are taken to the consolidated\nstatement of other comprehensive income and recorded as a separate component of\nequity until they are derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously\nreported is transferred to retained earnings.\nxvii) Investment in joint ventures\nThe Group’s investment in joint ventures is initially recorded at fair value and is re-\nmeasured at each reporting date, with resulting unrealized gains or losses being\nrecorded in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n65 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nxviii) Impairment and un-collectability of financial assets\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for\nexpected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets excluding investments classified as\nFVTPL and equity investments classified as FVOCI.\nThe Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the\nfollowing, for which they are measured as 12-month ECL:\n1. debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the\nreporting date; and\n2. other financial instruments on which credit risk has not increased significantly\nsince their initial recognition.\nThe Group considers a debt security to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is\nequivalent to the globally understood definition of 'investment grade'.\nxviii) Impairment and un-collectability of financial assets (continued)\nFor the purposes of calculation of ECL, the Group categorizes such financial assets into\nStage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:\nStage 1 – Performing: when such financial assets are first recognized, the Group\nrecognizes an allowance based up to 12- month ECL.\nStage 2 – Significant increase in credit risk: when such financial assets shows a\nsignificant increase in credit risk, the Group records an allowance for the lifetime ECL.\nStage 3 – Impaired: the Group recognizes the lifetime ECL for such financial assets.\nxix) De-recognition of financial instruments\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows\nfrom the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash\nflows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of\nthe financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains\nsubstantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of\nthe financial asset.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, any cumulative gain/ loss recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of other comprehensive income in respect of equity investments\ndesignated at FVOCI is transferred directly to retained earnings.\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or\ncancelled or has expired.\nxx) Derivative financial instruments\nDerivatives are stated at fair value determined by using prevailing market rates or\ninternal pricing models.\nDerivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are classified into fair value hedges or cash\nflow hedges. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or\nis sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Accounting\ntreatments for both types of hedges and in the case of discontinuance of hedges are\ndisclosed in Note 20.\n66 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nFor derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gain or loss arising from\nchanges in their fair value is taken to the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nxxi) Premises and equipment\nPremises and equipment substantially comprise land, buildings and related leasehold\nimprovements used by the Group as office premises.\nThe Company carries its building on freehold land and certain operating assets at\nrevalued amounts, being the fair value of the assets at the date of revaluation less any\nsubsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.\nValuations are performed frequently enough to ensure that the fair value of a revalued\nasset does not differ materially from its carrying value. Any revaluation surplus is\ncredited to the asset revaluation reserve included in equity, except to the extent that it\nreverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in profit and\nloss, in which case the increase is recognized in profit or loss. A revaluation deficit is\nrecognized directly in profit or loss, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous\nsurplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the asset revaluation\nreserve. A transfer from the asset revaluation reserve to retained earnings is made for\nany difference between the depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the\nasset and depreciation based on the original cost of the asset.\nAll other items are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nPremises and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated\nuseful lives which are as follows:\nBuildings on freehold land 25 years\nLeasehold and building improvements 10 - 15 years\nOperating assets 3 - 23 years\nThe above useful lives of the assets and methods of depreciation are reviewed and\nadjusted, if appropriate, at least at each financial year end.\nxxii) Right-of-use assets and lease liability\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and\nimpairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The\nrecognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together\nwith any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be\nexercised, or any period covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably\ncertain not to be exercised.\n67 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nxxii) Right-of-use assets and lease liability (continued)\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured\nat the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease\npayments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any\nlease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a\nrate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees as\napplicable. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the\nincremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the\namount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced\nfor the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is\nremeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-\nsubstance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the\nunderlying asset.\nxxiii) Intangible assets\nIntangible assets comprise management contracts and goodwill recognized on\nacquisition. Management contracts have a useful life of 5 years from the date of the\nacquisition and are amortized accordingly.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the\nconsideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed.\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment\nlosses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business\ncombination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-\ngenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of\nwhether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\nThe Group tests goodwill for impairment annually. For other intangible assets, the Group\nreviews the carrying amounts to determine whether there is any indication that those\nassets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable\namount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss\nand if any, impairment loss is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for\nthe period.\nxxiv) Payables, accruals and provisions\nProvision for employee benefit costs is made in accordance with contractual and\nstatutory obligations and the terms of benefit plans approved by the Board of Directors\n(see Note 24).\nProvisions are made when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past\nevent, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will\nbe required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of\nthe obligation.\n68 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nxxv) Unfunded deal acquisitions\nUnfunded deal acquisitions represent amounts contractually payable by the Group in\nrespect of investment acquisitions the agreements for which are signed, but have not\nbeen funded, as of the reporting date.\nxxvi) Borrowings\nBorrowings, represented by short term financing on call, medium-term revolvers,\nmedium-term debt and long-term debt, are initially recognized at the fair value of\nconsideration received and subsequently adjusted for the impact of effective fair value\nhedges. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) are\ntreated as collateralized financings. The corresponding cash received is recognized in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position as an asset with a corresponding\nobligation to return it as a liability within financing, reflecting the transaction’s economic\nsubstance as a loan to the Group.\nThe securities delivered repurchase agreements are not derecognized from the\nconsolidated statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially all of the\nrisks and rewards of ownership\nTransaction costs relating to borrowings are initially capitalized and deducted from the\nborrowings and subsequently recognized as interest expense over the expected life of\nthese borrowings.\nxxvii) Treasury shares\nTreasury shares are stated at acquisition cost and are shown as a deduction to equity.\nAny surplus arising from the subsequent sale of treasury shares at a price greater than\ncost is treated as non-distributable and included in a share premium reserve under\nequity. Any deficit arising from the subsequent sale of treasury shares at a price lower\nthan cost is charged first against any previously established reserve from past\ntransactions in treasury shares, and where such reserve is insufficient, then any\ndifference is charged to retained earnings.\nxxviii) Share awards\nShare awards to employees are accounted and expense recognized over the vesting\nperiod. The determination of the amount to be recognized is estimated based on a\nmodel that takes into account the probability weighted vesting of the shares at the fair\nvalue on the grant date using the historical pattern of employee tenure. These estimates\nare updated regularly based on actual information.\nxxix) Dividends\nProposed dividends are disclosed as appropriations within equity until the time they are\napproved by the shareholders. On approval by shareholders, these are transferred to\nliabilities.\n69 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

RISKMANAGEMENT\nRisk management is an integral part of Investcorp’s corporate decision-making process.\nThe Financial and Risk Management Committee (FRMC) oversees the Group’s risk\nmanagement activities, and sets Investcorp’s risk profile on an enterprise wide basis.\nThe FRMC is comprised of members of senior management drawn from all key areas of\nInvestcorp.\nThe Group’s primary risk management objective is to support its business objectives\nwith sufficient economic capital. The Group employs risk modelsto determine the capital\nneeded to cover unexpected losses from investment or other risks. This capital amount\nis known as economic capital. The economic capital requirement for each reporting\nsegment is determined for a one year horizon and subsequently aggregated to\ndetermine the total economic capital. This total economic capital is then stress tested\nunder a dynamic VaR approach. The dynamic VaR is calculated by using ve-year\nplanning horizon, a 99% one-tailed confidence level and by recognizing diversification\nbenefits across asset classes.\nIn addition to determining an adequate economic capital allocation for each reporting\nsegment, the risk management team has developed tools in conjunction with risk\nmanagement consultants to perform detailed risk analyses that spec cally address the\ninvestmentrisks ineach individual lineof business.\nThe principal risks associated with the Group’s business, and the related risk\nmanagement processes are explained below:\ni) Counterparty creditrisk\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on its short term funds, placements, fair\nvalue of derivatives, receivables, advances, debt investments and guarantees. Investcorp\nmanages counterparty credit risk by setting limits for all counterparties. The Group also\nmonitors credit exposures, and continually assesses the creditworthiness of\ncounterparties. Counterparty credit risk in respect of derivative financial instruments is\nlimited to those with positive fair values. With respect to the counterparty credit risk\nexposure arising from other financial assets, the Group has a maximum exposure equal\nto the carrying value of these instruments. Investcorp also actively attempts to mitigate\ncounterparty credit risks, where possible, through documented netting and margin\narrangements withcounterparties, underISDA andCSAagreements.\nThe risk management team maintains an overall external rating-based methodology for\nsetting Board approved counterparty limits. For rated counterparties, credit ratings from\nat least two rating agencies are used for developing counterparty limits. All non-rated\ncounterparties are screened through due diligence and credit analysis prior to the\nassumption of credit exposures to them by Investcorp. These non-rated counterparties\nare also categorizedunder the ‘Standard’ internal ratingfor financial reporting purposes.\n38 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22.

RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nii) Credit Risk Measurement\nSignificantincreaseincredit risk\nWhen determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable\ninformation that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both\nquantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical\nexperience,expert creditassessment andforward-looking information.\nAs a practical expedient, IFRS 9 provides a low credit risk (‘LCR’) operational\nsimplification that if a financial instrument has low credit risk i.e. an investment grade\ncredit rating, an entity is allowed to assume at the reporting date that no significant\nincrease in credit risk hasoccurred.\nThe Group considers financial instruments with an external rating grade of ‘investment\ngrade’as LCR fortheshort-term liquid asset portfolio.\nThe receivables and advances of the Group are collateralized by the underlying\ninvestments. Hence, the Group considers fair-value movementsof suchinvestments and\nmanagement judgement to assess whether there has been a significant increase in\ncredit risk for itsreceivables and advances portfolio.\nMeasurement of ECL\nThe Group measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default\n(EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). PD represents the likelihood of a borrower\ndefaulting on its financial obligation. EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to\nbe owed at the time of default. LGD represents the group’s expectation of the extent of\nloss on the exposure.\nFor the short-term liquid asset portfolio, external rating agency credit grades are used.\nThese published grades are continuously monitored and updated. The PDs associated\nwith each grade are determined based on realized default rates over the period of 12\nmonths, as published by the rating agencies, after adjusting for forward-looking macro-\neconomic information.\nFor receivables and advances that arise in connection with the PE asset class, PDs are\nderived using an internal model and adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic\ninformation. PDs for receivables and advances of the RE asset class are derived based\non internal categorization of the related investment and default rates published by a\nreputable rating agencyadjustedfor forward-looking macro-economic information.\nFor secured assets, LGDs are determined based on factors which impact the recoveries\nmadepost default.Forunsecured assets,LGDs are based on regulatory guidelines.\nTheGroup writes-off exposuresif there is noreasonable expectation of recovery.\n41 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISKMANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\niii) Funding liquidity risk\nFunding liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to fund increases in assets\nand meet obligations when they fall due, without incurring unacceptable losses.

RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nv) Market price risk\nThe principal market related risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign currency\nrisk, interest raterisk and equity price risk associated with its co-investments in absolute\nreturn investments, private equity investments, strategic capital investments, strategic\ninvestments, credit management investments and real estate investments, as well as on\nits debt financings. For the purpose of managing market price risks, the Group has\nestablished appropriate procedures and limits approved by the Boardof Directors.\nIn addition, for internal risk assessments, the Group uses a variety of internal and\nexternal models to analyze the market price risks that may arise from adverse market\nmovements.\nMarket price risk has been further detailed below under (a) foreign currency risk, (b)\ninterest rate risk and (c) equity pricerisk.\nv) (a)Foreign currencyrisk\nThe Group’s overall policy is generally to hedge all non-US dollar denominated assets,\nliabilities and commitments, and a proportion of its assets denominated in US-pegged\ncurrencies, into US dollars utilizing currency risk management products. In the normal\ncourse of its business, the Group utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and other\nforeign exchange derivatives to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange\nrates. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and hedging strategies are used to\nensure positions are maintained within established exposure and Value at Risk (“VaR”)\nrisk limits.\nThe Group’s significant net hedged and unhedged foreign currency positions are set out\nbelow.\n$millions June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021\nNet hedged Net unhedged Net hedged Net unhedged\nLong (Short)\nexposure exposure exposure exposure\nBahraini Dinar* 12 (1) 12 (1)\nSaudi Riyal* 84 (7) 82 (9)\nEuro 276 (0) 61 -\nPounds Sterling 84 (0) 137 (1)\nSwiss Francs 1 0 42 -\nJapanese Yen (233) 0 (271) -\nUAE Dirham* 0 (0) 0 0\nSwedish Krona 3 (0) 111 -\nNorwegian Krona 4 (0) 4 -\nChinese Renminbi 0 (0) 1 -\nDanish Krona 63 0 75 -\nSingaporean Dollar 0 (1) 0 (0)\nKuwaiti Dinar 1 (1) 42 (1)\nIndian Rupees 21 (0) - -\n316 (10) 296 (12)\n* Currency exchange rate currently pegged against the US Dollar.\n46 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nv) Market price risk (continued)\nv) (a)Foreign currencyrisk(continued)\nIncidental unhedged positions are subjected to market risk calculation based on their\nVaR. VaR estimates the potential loss due to market movement of foreign exchange\nrates or volatility of those rates. Potential market movements of foreign exchange rates\nare derived from a study of their historical volatility. The risk methodology is based on\nthe assumption that changes in foreign exchange rates follow a normal probability\ndistribution over time. The characteristics of normal distribution are then used to assess\nportfolio risk. However, the Group’s risk management team conducts back testing by\ncomparing the daily VaR with the daily profit and loss to ensure the robustness of the\nVaR model.\nThe following table summarizes the 99% confidence level over a 1-day holding period\nVaRfor the Group’sforeign currency exposures.\n$millions 2022 2021\nAverage FX VaR 16 21\nYear end FX VaR 7 25\nMaximum FX VaR 34 59\nMinimum FX VaR 7 9\nThe foreign exchange lossrecognizedin theconsolidated statement ofprofit or lossas a\nresult of incidental unhedged positions and costs of hedging against foreign exchange\nrisk amountsto$1.8million (2021:$1.9million).\nv)(b)Interestrate risk\nInvestcorp closely monitors interest rate movements, and seeks to limit its exposure to\nsuch movements by managing the interest rate repricing structure of its assets and\nliabilities. Investcorp actively manages its interest rate repricing gap exposure, with a\nbias towards floating rates and with exposure limits that are approved by the Board of\nDirectors. The Group does not take interest rate trading positions and all of its interest\nrate risk is typically in the Company’s book where hedge accounting applies. Investcorp\nalso utilizes interest rate related derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure\nto fluctuationsininterest ratesfor specifictransactions or groupsof transactions.\nA majority of the Group's interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities carry\nfloating rates of interest or if they carry fixed rates they have been hedged to floating\nratesofinterest, except forthefollowing:\nCredit management Investments amounting to $206 million (June 30, 2021: $255\nmillion), which earn interest at an effective rate ranging between 2.5% to 14.7%\n(June 30, 2021: 2.5% to14.7%)per annum.\nThe Group is currently assessing the impact of transition away from Libor on the\nconsolidatedfinancial statements.\n47 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22.

RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nvi) Operational risk\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems or from external events (such as natural disasters,\nchanges in regulation or outsourcing of operations). Investcorp includes in this definition\nlegal risk but excludesreputational and strategic risks.\nWhile operational risks cannot be entirely eliminated, they are managed and mitigated\nby ensuring that appropriate infrastructure, controls, systems, procedures and trained\nand competent people are in place throughout Investcorp. The internal audit department\nmakes regular, independent appraisals of the control environment in all identified risk\nareas. Contingency arrangements, which are tested from time to time, are also in place\nto support operations in the event of a range of possible disaster scenarios. In addition,\nInvestcorp carries errors and omissions insurance against legal risks arising from its\nbusiness activities.\nInvestcorp applies the Basic Indicator Approach (‘BIA’) to measure operational risk and\nalso is implementing a Board of Directors approved operational risk management\nframework. Under the BIA approach, the operational risk charge is calculated by taking\nInvestcorp’s average gross income over the preceding two years and current financial\nyear and multiplying it by a fixed alpha coefficient (15 per cent). The operational risk\nmanagement framework consists of the following: 1) “Risk Control and Self-\nAssessment”: Self-assess operational risks by going through key business processes\nend-to-end, 2) Evaluate the adequacy of existing process controls, 3) Implement control\nmodifications to reduce operational risks and determine residual risks and 4) Monitor\nandreportoperational risk events toseniormanagement and the Board.\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIALINSTRUMENTS\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paidto transfera liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair\nvalue measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or\ntransfer the liability takes place either:\nIn the principal marketfor the assetor liability,or\nIn the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability\nTheprincipal orthe most advantageous marketmust be accessible to theGroup.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability, on the basis that market\nparticipants act in their economic best interest.\n50 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIALINSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\nInvestcorp has established guidelines for the valuation of its investments which are\nreviewed by the Board of Directors and abides by guidelines issued under IFRS on\nvaluation of investments and guidelines recommended by the International Private\nEquity and Venture Capital Association. Investcorp performs valuations of its\ninvestments on a quarterly basis. The business support teams work along with deal\nteams to prepare valuation packages in accordance with the valuation guidelines of\nInvestcorp. The valuation packages are then presented to the Valuation Committee\nwhich is comprised of senior members of the Finance team and investing lines of\nbusiness. The Valuation Committee has the final responsibility of reviewing and\napproving the fair valueofall investments.\nUnderlying the definition of fair value is the presumption that the Group is a going\nconcern without any intention or requirement to curtail materially the scale of its\noperationsor to undertake a transaction on adverse terms.\nFair value adjustments arise from re-measurement of liabilities which are hedged,\ninvestmentsandderivatives.\nNonetheless the actual amount that is realizedin a future transactionmay differfrom the\ncurrent estimate of fair value, given the inherent uncertainty surrounding valuations of\nunquoted investments.\nThe fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different\nfrom their carrying values except for certain assets and liabilities carried at amortized\ncost. The fair value of CLO co-investments carried at amortized cost amounts to $101.1\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $145.6 million) as compared to the carrying value of $101.9\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $145.3 million). The fair value of CLO co-investments is based\non inputs from independent third parties and falls under Level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy disclosure. The fair value of medium and long term debt amounts to $350\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $414.8 million) as compared to the carrying value of $359.5\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $417.4 million). The fair value of medium and long term debt is\nbased on inputs from third party banks and falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\ndescribed below.\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of\nfinancial instruments:\nLevel 1: quotedpricesin active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability,\neither directly (i.e. asprices)orindirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\nLevel 3: inputs forthe asset orliability that are not basedonobservable market data (i.e.\nunobservable inputs).\nDuring the current financial year, there was no transfer between levels (June 30, 2021:\n$6.9 million). Under absolute return investments, an exposure of $4 million (June 30,\n2021: $5.3 million) is comprised of illiquid side pocket investments which are classified\nas Level 3. The year to date fair value changes on this ARI exposure amounts to a loss\nof $0.3 million (June 30, 2021: gain of $0.6 million) and the net redemptions amount to\n$0.9million(June 30,2021: $1million).\n51 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n23.

This philosophy is exhibited in Investcorp’s\nremuneration programsandit is reflected in itsannual remuneration decisions.\nThe remuneration that is paid to Investcorp’s employees is divided into two fundamental\ncomponents: (i) fixed remuneration, i.e., salary and benefits, and (ii) variable\nremuneration.\nVariable remuneration, comprised of cash and awards under deferred remuneration\nprograms, is remuneration that varies from year to year and the amount of which is\ndependent upon (i) the financial performance of Investcorp as a whole, (ii) the risk-\nadjusted performance of each employee’s respective line of business and (iii) the\nperformanceofthe individual employee.\n53 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nInvestcorp extensively utilizes deferred remuneration programs as part of employees’\nremuneration. These programs are comprised of investment carried interest and co-\ninvestment programs and share-linked programsasdescribed briefly below.\nPrograms forInvestment Profit Participation\nThe Group’s investment professionals in its private equity investment, real estate\ninvestment and investment relationship management lines of business participate in\ninvestment carried interest programs, whereby a certainvariable portion of exit proceeds\ndue to investors from realization of their investments is shared with these professionals,\nprovided certain pre-established minimum client return hurdles are satisfied. Netting\nmechanisms are used so that returns from investments that perform well are netted\nagainst other investments in which losses are sustained. Since this carry is awarded up\nfront at the timeof acquisitionit hasno significant value at thetimeof theaward.\nPrograms forInvestment Participation\nInvestment professionals and relationship managers also participate in a co-investment\nprogram pursuant to which they acquire an interest in the Investcorp Group’s\ninvestments that they manage at the Investcorp Group’s Consolidated Statement of\nFinancial Position carrying value, thereby resulting in no gain or loss to Investcorp\nexceptfor any potential impairment losses on the financing provided.\nUnder certain legacy co-investment programs, the Group provided financing at market\nrates to or on behalf of eligible employees, to invest in these programs on a levered\nbasis. The permissible levels of leverage varied on a product to product and program to\nprogram basis. The aggregate remaining amount of such financing provided to or on\nbehalf of employees as of June30, 2022is $1.5million (June 30,2021:$2.3million).\nA portion of the deferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is also in the form\nof co-investment exposures. These awards have different vesting conditions and are not\ntransferable. An expense charge of $8 million (2021: $10 million) was taken by the\nGroup basedonmanagement’sbest estimate ofthelikely vesting of the awards.\nEmployee Share-LinkedPlans\nSHL sponsors various employee share-linked plans under which a portion of the\ndeferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is in the form of SIPCO shares or\nphantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based awards that\nrepresent a beneficial interest in the ordinary shares of the Company. These SIPCO\nawardshave different vesting periods and are not transferable.\nSIPCO shares or phantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based\nawards are granted to the employees at their fair value on the grant date. The fair value\nof SIPCO shares for purposes of the plans is estimated considering their non-\ntransferability andtheindirect natureof theunderlying beneficial ownership. Thevalue of\nSIPCO shares granted during the year is $21.3 million (2021: $30.2 million). The start\nand end date of the vesting period for each grant varies from plan to plan and is based\non continued employment (unless employment is terminated due to death, disability or\nretirement) as well as satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The determination\nof the amount of expense to be recognized as compensation expense in any year is\nestimatedbasedon a model thattakes into account the probability weighted vesting of\n54 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nthe shares at the fair value on the grant date using the historical pattern of employee\ntenure. These estimatesare updated regularly based on actual information.\nAn expense charge of $18.4 million (2021: $16.2 million) was taken by the Group based\non management’sbest estimate of the number of shares that are likelyto vest. The grant\ndate value of shares vested during the year amounted to $20.9 million (2021: $19\nmillion). The details of shares granted, vested and forfeited during the year are as\nfollows:\nNumber of shares 2022 2021\nGranted during the year 4,938 7,513\nVested during the year 4,819 4,351\nForfeited during the year 372 395\nThe fair value of shares granted during the year amounted to $21.3 million (2021: $30.2\nmillion). The fair value of shares forfeited during the year amounted to $1.6 million\n(2021:$1.7million).\n25. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSAND BALANCES\nA. DUEFROM/ DUE TOA RELATED PARTY\nAmounts due from/ due to a related party represent balances due from/ due to\nInvestcorpHoldings.\nB. OTHERRELATED PARTYTRANSACTIONS\nFor the Group, related parties include its investee companies, companies that hold\nclients’ investments (investment holding companies), client fund companies associated\nwith ARI,SIPCO Limitedand the Trusts.\nIt also includes major shareholders, directors and senior management of the Company,\ntheir immediate families and entities controlled, jointly controlled or significantly\ninfluenced by such parties. Income is earned or expense is incurred in the Group’s\ntransactions with such related parties in the ordinary course of business. The Group’s\nmanagement approves the terms and conditionsofallrelated party transactions.\nAlthough these companies are classified as related parties, the Group administers and\nmanages the companies that hold clients’ investments on a fiduciary basis on behalf of\nits clients who are third parties and are the beneficiaries of a majority of the economic\ninterest from the underlying investments of these companies. As a result, the true nature\nof the Group’s transactions with these companies is effectively at commercial terms as\nspecified under pre-determinedmanagement agreements.\nIn addition to the compensation and benefits to employees disclosed in Note 24, the\nincome earned and expenses incurred in connection with related party transactions\nincludedin these consolidatedfinancial statements are as follows:\n55 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n25.

SIGNIFICANTACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards(“IFRS”).\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in United States\ndollars, this being the functional currency of the Group, and rounded to the nearest\nmillions ($millions) unless otherwise stated. Certain prior year balances have been\nreclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no\nimpact on the net loss orequity of the Group.\nThe Group has adopted the below listed amendments to standards effective from July 1,\n2021. The adoption of these amendments did not have any material impact on the\nconsolidated financialstatements ofthe Group.\n56 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANTACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nAmendments to IFRS 4, IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 39 – Phase 2 of\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform.\nWhile some of the Group's financial instruments are subject to IBOR reforms at\n30 June 2022 and have not yet transitioned out of the current IBOR to ARR, the\nGroup has already made substantial progress to finalize the transition from IBOR\nto the new ARR. Several milestones have been completed, such as the upgrade\nof the technology systems to handle the new reference rate, review of significant\nthe Group’s internal documents and planning to amend documentation for\nexisting contracts such as the existing Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group\nexpects to have the full transition implemented by June 2023.\nNew standards, amendments and interpretationsissuedbut notyet effective\nAmendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (issued May\n2020, effectivefor annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022);\nAmendments to IAS 16 - Proceeds before Intended Use (issued May 2020,\neffective for annual periodsbeginning on or after1 January 2022);\nAmendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\n(issued May 2020, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2022);\nAmendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 -\n2020-effective for annualperiods beginning onor after 1January 2022;\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued May 2017; effective for annual periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2023);\nAmendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n(issued January 2020; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1\nJanuary 2023);\nAmendments to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued February 2021;\neffective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January2023); and\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of Accounting\nPolicies (issued February 2021; effective for annual period beginning on or after\n1 January 2023).\nThe Group’s management is currently evaluating the impact of the above standard and\namendments onthe consolidatedfinancial statements.\ni) Accounting convention\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention\nexcept for the re-measurement at fair value of financial instruments under IFRS 9 and\nrevaluationof premises andequipment.\nii) Going concern\nThe Group’s management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going\nconcern and is satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in business\nfor the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material\nuncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared\nonagoing concern basis.\n57 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANTACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\niii) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are comprised of the financial statements of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity which is controlled by the Group.\nControl is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns\nthrough its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through\nits power over the entity. The Group consolidates its subsidiaries excluding entities\nwhich meet thebelow criteria:\na) Where there are contractual or other restrictions imposed on the Group’s ability\ntoappointthe majority ofthe Board ofDirectors, or\nb) Where a majority of the economic risk and reward accrues to third parties other\nthan the Group, or\nc) Where the exception to consolidate subsidiaries of an Investment entity is\napplied,asdefined in IFRS10.\nThe Group qualifies as an investment entity as defined under IFRS 10, and as such,\nmeasuresits investments in accordance with the requirements setout inthestandard.\nThe results of all subsidiaries are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss\nfrom the effective date of formation or acquisition. The financial statements of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company,\nusing consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances, income and expenses\nhavebeeneliminated on consolidation.\niv) Business Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an\nacquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is\nmeasured at acquisition date fair value. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as\nincurred.\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities\nassumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the\ncontractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditionsas at the acquisition\ndate.\nv) Tradedateaccounting\nPurchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery of the assets within a\ntimeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place are\nrecognized using the “trade date” accounting basis (i.e. the date that the entity commits\ntopurchase orsell the asset).\nvi) Offsetting\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable\nrighttooffsetthe recognized amounts andtheGroup intendsto settle on a net basis.\n58 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nvii) Use ofestimates andjudgments\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of financial assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates is principally\nlimited to:\na) The determination of the fair values of FVTPL co-investments in private equity\nco-investments, credit management co-investments, strategic capital co-\ninvestments and real estate co-investments and other strategic investments\n(see Note 10), and investment in SPACs (Note 9), the determination of\nperformance fees on assets under management, impairment provisions for\nfinancial assets other than FVTPL investments and FVOCI equity investments\n(see Note 13) and allocation of placement fee to the performance obligations\nas described later.\nb) The determination of performance fees on assets under management are\ndependent on the performance of the underlying investments and thus are\nhighly susceptibletofactorsoutside the Group’sinfluence\nc) The determination of cash flows which is the basis for performing the\nassessment of solely payments of principal and interest test on CLO co-\ninvestments whichare being carried as debt instruments at amortized cost(see\nNote10).\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made\njudgments covered in the following section, apart from those involving estimates, which\nhave the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe valuation approach was substantially consistent with our normal process and\nvaluation policy. A key focus of the portfolio fair value was an assessment of the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on each investment. The approach considered the\nperformance of each investment exposure before the outbreak of COVID-19, the\nprojected short-term impact on their ability to generate earnings and cash flow and also\nlonger-term view of their ability to recover and perform against their investment cases.\nGiven the diversity of the portfolio, the impact has been varied, based on type of\nunderlying exposure, industry exposure, expected recovery from the current crisis and\ncurrent market inputs.\nviii) Foreigncurrencies\nA foreign currency transaction is recorded in the functional currency at the rate of\nexchange prevailing at the value date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities\nin foreign currencies that are held at the reporting date are retranslated at market rates\nof exchange prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under treasury and other\nincome.\n59 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nNon-monetary assets that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies\nare recorded at rates of exchange prevailing at the value dates of the transactions. Non-\nmonetary assets in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated at\nexchange rates prevailing on the dates the fair values were determined. Gains and\nlosses on fair valuationof FVTPLinvestments are taken to the consolidatedstatement of\nprofit or loss.\nForeign currency differences arising from the translation of investments in respect of\nwhich an election has been made to present subsequent changes in FVOCI are\nrecognizedinthe consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.\nix) Income\nInterest income is recognized using the effective yield of the asset and is recorded as\nasset based income. Asset based income from all co-investments classified as FVTPL\ninvestments is recognized on the basis of realized and unrealized changes in fair value\nas at the end ofthe reporting period.\nFee income is recognized when services are rendered. Performance fees are\nrecognized when earned. Performance fees are only recognized once it is highly\nprobable that there would be no significant reversal of any accumulated revenue in the\nfuture. Estimates are needed to assess the risk that achieved earnings may be reversed\nbefore realization due to the risk of lower future overall performance of the underlying\ninvestments. The reversal risk is managed through adjustments of the unrealized\ninvestment values by imposing discounts depending on specific investment risks and on\nthe expected average remainingholding period ofthe investment.\nRealized capital gains or losses on FVOCI equity investments are taken to retained\nearnings at thetimeof derecognition of theinvestment.\nPlacement fees are charged when an underwritten investment is placed with investors.\nThe Group has identified the performance obligations arising from its contracts with\ninvestors with whom the investments are placed. The portion of the fee relating to such\nperformance obligationsisdeferred and recognizedoverthe investmentperiod.\nInvestcorp has reviewed and analyzed the terms of the contracts that it has entered into\nwith its investors arising from the placement of its investments. Based on this review,\nthe Group has determined the following two types of performance obligations that\nInvestcorpis expected to satisfy:\ni. services provided by Investcorp during the year from purchase to the placement of\nthe investment with investors, including deal identification, funding, underwriting,\nmaintaining a placement infrastructure, preparing the marketing materials for each\ndeal etc;and\nii. services providedoverthe periodof the investmentasagreed with theinvestoratthe\ntime of placement.\nInvestcorp has allocated the placement fee to each of the above performance\nobligations. The Group completes all of its performance obligations described in (i)\nabove before placing an investment with its investors. Accordingly, the fee relating to\nthis performance obligation is recognized upfront upon placement of the investment\nwith investors. This portion of the placement fee is included as part of deal fees except\nfor placement fee from program clientswhich is included as part of AUM fees.\n60 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nA portion of the placement fee represents the amount received upfront for the\nperformance obligation described in (ii) above. Accordingly, this component of the\nplacement fee is deferred and recognized over time, as AUM fees, over the period of\nmanagingthe investment.\nx) Interestexpenses\nInterest on borrowings represents funding cost and is calculated using the effective\ninterest rate method, adjusted for gainsor losses on related cash flow hedges.\nxi) Taxation of foreignoperations\nThere is no tax on corporate income in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Taxation on income\nfrom foreign subsidiaries is provided for in accordance with the fiscal regulations of the\ncountries inwhich the respective Group entities operate.\nDeferred taxation is provided for using the liability method on all temporary differences\ncalculated at the rate at which it is expected to be payable. Deferred tax assets are only\nrecognized ifrecovery is probable.\nxii) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term funds, cash in transit, other\nliquid funds and placements with financial institutions that are readily convertible into\ncashandare subject toinsignificant risk ofchanges in value.\nxiii) Receivables\nSubscription receivables are recognized when the obligation is established, i.e., when a\nbinding subscription agreement is signed. These are carried at cost less provision for\nimpairment.\nxiv) Advances\nAdvances are stated at amortized cost, net ofany impairment provisions.\nxv) Classificationoffinancial assets\n(a) Investments\nThe group classifiesthefinancial assetsinto variouscategories as setout in Note 4.\nOn initial investment, a debt investment is measured at amortized cost if the financial\nasset is held to collect contractual cash flows over the life of the asset and if those cash\nflows comprise solely of principal repayments and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding.\nThe Group also classifies certain strategic investments, real estate co-investment,\nprivate equity co-investments, strategic capital co-investments, credit management\ninvestments andARIinvestments as FVOCI investments.\nAll other investments including those over which the Group has significant influence are\nclassified as FVTPL.\n61 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (CONTINUED)\n(b) Otherliquid assets\nOther liquid assets, which form part of “placements with financial institutions and other\nliquid assets”, are recorded at amortized cost less any impairment in value other than\nthose assets which contain embedded derivatives requiring either separation of the\nembedded derivative or classification of the entire instrument as FVTPL assets. The\nmanagement has designated suchassetsasFVTPL assets.\nxvi) Co-investments\na. Co-investments in private equityinvestmentandreal estateinvestment\nThe Group’s co-investments in private equity investment and real estate investment are\nclassified as FVTPL and FVOCI investments. FVTPL investments are initially recorded\nat acquisition cost (being the initial fair value) and are re-measured to fair value at each\nreporting date, with resulting unrealized gains or losses being recorded as fair value\nchanges in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Consequently, there are no\nimpairmentprovisions for suchinvestments.\nFVOCI investments are initially recorded at fair value. These investments are then re-\nmeasured to fair value at each reporting date and any resulting change in value of these\ninvestments is taken to the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income and\nrecorded as a separate component of equity until they are derecognized at which time\nthe cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is transferred to retained\nearnings.\nb. Co-investmentsin credit managementinvestment\nThe Group’s co-investments in credit management and any new exposure acquired\nduring the year are classified as FVOCI debt investments. All other credit management\nco-investment exposures are carried at amortised cost less any impairment provision.\nInterest income on amortized cost instruments is recognized using the effective interest\nrate (“EIR”).\nFVOCI debt investments are initially recorded at fair value. Any subsequent fair value\nchanges on such investments will be recognized directly in equity and any impairment in\nthe carrying value will be recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. At\nthe time of derecognition, any cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is\ntransferred to retained earnings through profit or loss. The fair value changes in FVTPL\ninvestmentsarerecorded in the consolidated statementof profit or loss.\nAny revision of estimated future cash flows are discounted at the original EIR with a\nconsequential adjustment to the carrying amount and a corresponding increase or\ndecreasein consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nc. Co-investmentsinabsolute returninvestments\nThe Group’s co-investments in absolute return investments are classified as FVTPL and\nFVOCI investments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date. The fair value\nchanges in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or\nloss.\n62 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES(CONTINUED)\nThe fair value changes in the FVOCI investments are taken to the consolidated\nstatement of other comprehensive income and recorded as a separate component of\nequity until they are derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously\nreportedistransferredto retained earnings.\nd. Co-investments in strategic capital investment\nThe Group’s co-investments in strategic capital investments are classified as FVTPL\ninvestments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date. The fair value changes in\nFVTPLinvestments arerecordedin theconsolidated statement ofprofit or loss.\ne. Investment in structured products\nThe Group’s investments in structured products are classified as FVTPL and are stated\nat fair value at the reporting date. The fair value changes in FVTPL investments are\nrecorded in theconsolidated statement of profit or loss.\nf. Investment inother strategic investments\nThe Group’s investments in other strategic investments are classified as FVTPL and\nFVOCI investments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date. The fair value\nchanges in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or\nloss.\nThe fair value changes in the FVOCI investments are taken to the consolidated\nstatement of other comprehensive income and recorded as a separate component of\nequity until they are derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously\nreportedistransferred to retained earnings.\ng. Investment injointventures\nThe Group’s investment in joint ventures is initially recorded at fair value and is re-\nmeasured at each reporting date, with resulting unrealized gains or losses being\nrecordedinconsolidated statement of profit or loss.\nh. Impairment and un-collectabilityof financial assets\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for\nexpected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets excluding investments classified as\nFVTPLandequityinvestments classified as FVOCI.\nThe Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the\nfollowing, for whichthey are measured as 12-monthECL:\n1. debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the\nreporting date;and\n2. other financial instruments on which credit risk has not increased significantly\nsince theirinitial recognition.\nThe Group considers a debt security tohave low creditrisk when theircredit risk ratingis\nequivalent tothe globallyunderstooddefinition of 'investment grade'.\nFor the purposes of calculation of ECL, the Group categorizes such financial assets into\nStage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as describedbelow:\n63 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES(CONTINUED)\nStage 1 – Performing: when such financial assets are first recognized, the Group\nrecognizes an allowance basedup to 12-month ECL.\nStage 2 – Significant increase in credit risk: when such financial assets shows a\nsignificant increase in credit risk, the Grouprecords an allowance for the lifetimeECL.\nStage 3 –Impaired:theGroup recognizesthe lifetimeECL for such financial assets.\ni. De-recognition of financialinstruments\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows\nfrom the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash\nflows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of\nthe financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains\nsubstantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of\nthefinancialasset.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, any cumulative gain/ loss recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of other comprehensive income in respect of equity investments\ndesignated at FVOCIistransferred directly to retained earnings.\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation undertheliability is discharged or\ncancelled or hasexpired.\nj. Derivative financial instruments\nDerivatives are stated at fair value determined by using prevailing market rates or\ninternal pricing models.\nDerivativesthatqualify for hedgeaccounting are classified intofairvaluehedges or cash\nflow hedges. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or\nis sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Accounting\ntreatments for both types of hedges and in the case of discontinuance of hedges are\ndisclosed in Note 20.\nFor derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gain or loss arising from\nchanges in theirfair value is taken to the consolidatedstatementof profit or loss.\nk. Premises and equipment\nPremises and equipment substantially comprise land, buildings and related leasehold\nimprovements usedby the Group as office premises.\nThe Company carries its building on freehold land and certain operating assets at\nrevalued amounts, being the fair value of the assets at the date of revaluation less any\nsubsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.\nValuations are performed frequently enough to ensure that the fair value of a revalued\nasset does not differ materially from its carrying value. Any revaluation surplus is\ncredited to the asset revaluation reserve included in equity, except to the extent that it\nreverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in profit and\nloss, in which case the increase is recognized in profit or loss. A revaluation deficit is\nrecognized directly in profit or loss, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous\nsurplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the asset revaluation\nreserve. A transfer from the asset revaluation reserve to retained earnings is made for\nany difference between the depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the\nasset and depreciation based on the originalcostofthe asset.\n64 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nAllother itemsare recorded at cost lessaccumulateddepreciation.\nPremises and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated\nusefullives which are as follows:\nBuildings on freehold land 25 years\nLeasehold and building improvements 10-15years\nOperating assets 3-23years\nThe above useful lives of the assets and methods of depreciation are reviewed and\nadjusted, if appropriate,at least at eachfinancial year end.\nl. Right-of-useassets and lease liability\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost,less any accumulated depreciation and\nimpairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The\nrecognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together\nwith any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be\nexercised, or any period covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably\ncertain not to be exercised.\nAt thecommencement date of the lease,the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured\nat the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease\npayments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any\nlease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a\nrate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees as\napplicable. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the\nincremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the\namount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced\nfor the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is\nremeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-\nsubstance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the\nunderlying asset.\nm. Intangible assets\nIntangible assets comprise management contracts and goodwill recognized on\nacquisition. Management contracts have a useful life of 5 years from the date of the\nacquisitionand are amortized accordingly.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the\nconsideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed.\n65 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment\nlosses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business\ncombination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-\ngenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of\nwhetherother assets or liabilitiesofthe acquireeareassignedto thoseunits.\nThe Group tests goodwill for impairment annually. For other intangible assets, the Group\nreviews the carrying amounts to determine whether there is any indication that those\nassets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable\namount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss\nand if any, impairment loss is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for\nthe period.\nn. Payables,accruals and provisions\nProvision for employee benefit costs is made in accordance with contractual and\nstatutory obligations and the terms of benefit plans approved by the Board of Directors\n(see Note 24).\nProvisions are made when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past\nevent, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will\nbe required tosettle the obligation and areliable estimate can be made of the amount of\nthe obligation.\no. Unfundeddeal acquisitions\nUnfunded deal acquisitions represent amounts contractually payable by the Group in\nrespect of investment acquisitions the agreements for which are signed, but have not\nbeenfunded, as ofthereportingdate.\np. Borrowings\nBorrowings, represented by short term financing on call, medium-term revolvers,\nmedium-term debt and long-term debt, are initially recognized at the fair value of\nconsideration received and subsequently adjusted for the impact of effective fair value\nhedges. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) are\ntreated as collateralized financings. The corresponding cash received is recognized in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position as an asset with a corresponding\nobligation to return it as a liability within financing, reflecting the transaction’s economic\nsubstance as aloan tothe Group.\nThe securities delivered repurchase agreements are not derecognized from the\nconsolidated statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially all of the\nrisksand rewards of ownership\nTransaction costs relating to borrowings are initially capitalized and deducted from the\nborrowings and subsequently recognized as interest expense over the expected life of\ntheseborrowings.\nq. Treasury shares\nTreasury shares are stated at acquisition cost and are shown as a deduction to equity.\nAny surplus arising from the subsequent sale of treasury shares at a price greater than\ncost is treated asnon-distributable andincludedin ashare premiumreserveunder\n66 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26.

Other expenses, comprising professional fees, travel and\nbusiness development, administration and infrastructure costs and non-compensation personnel costs such as\ntraining and recruitment increased by 18% to $91 million as compared to $77 million for the same period last year.\nThis is primarily due to an increase in travel and other discretionary expenses as travel restrictions imposed due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic started to ease as well as the generally increasing costs as markets have re-opened\naround the world and inflationary pressures are rising globally.\nOperating expenses ($ millions) FY22 FY21 Change H/(L)\nStaff compensation 225 199 26\nOther personnel costs and charges 22 14 8\nOther operating expenses 91 77 14\nTotal operating expenses 338 290 48\nFull time employees (‘FTE’) at end of period 486 427 59\nStaff compensation per FTE (‘000) 463 466 (1%)\nTotal staff compensation / total operating expenses 67% 69% (2%)\nCost-to-income(a) 69% 68% 1%\n(a) Operating expenses / Net revenue.

The affirmation also reflects the vulnerability of Investcorp's business model to a market downturn\nand Fitch's view of the firm's ability to maintain credit metrics in line with expectations.\n“Rating constraints include the firm's increased earnings volatility and placement risk relative to peers, given its\nbusiness model of offering investments to clients on a fully underwritten deal-by-deal basis and its sizable co-\ninvestment portfolio, which is subject to fair value changes. Activity fees, which are earned from transactional\nactivities and have comprised almost half of Investcorp's core fees over the past several years, are also susceptible\nto market volatility.”2\nIn November 2021, Moody’s affirmed Investcorp’s credit ratings at Ba2, and ‘Negative’ outlook. “The rating reflects\nthe company's solid market position in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region as a leading alternative\ninvestment provider, its global franchise, healthy operating margin and good asset retention.\n“Furthermore, Investcorp's level of assets under management (AUM) and liquidity are expected to remain resilient,\nand the company has a significant amount of loss-absorbing equity capital which counters its elevated balance\nsheet risk. The rating and its associated negative outlook also reflects our expectation that Investcorp group's gross\ndebt / adjusted EBITDA will remain elevated as the company seeks to diversify its funding sources.”3\nEquity\nEquity ($ millions) Jun-22 Jun-21 Change H/(L)\nOrdinary shareholders’ equity 895 854 41\nPreference share capital 375 375 -\nProposed appropriations 52 44 8\nOther reserves (8) (3) (5)\nNon-controlling interests 1 2 (1)\nNet book equity 1,315 1,272 43\nNet equity as of June 30, 2022 remained stable at $1.3 billion.

The\nincrease in total client AUM in FY22 is largely attributable to the 34% increase in real estate client AUM to $8.3\nbillion from $6.2 billion. This increase is largely due to the acquisition and placement of various new portfolios and\nfundraising for the new Industrial Real Estate Venture. Credit management client AUM increased by 11% to $15.7\nbillion from $14.2 billion largely due to the issuance/pricing of several CLOs. The growth in credit management\nclient AUM has been somewhat offset by the devaluation of the EUR versus the USD during the year. Absolute\nreturn client AUM decreased slightly by 1% to $7.4 billion from $7.5 billion mainly due to lower EUR FX conversion\nrate. Private equity client AUM decreased by 5% to $5.2 billion primarily due to exits more than offsetting new\nacquisitions and fundraising.
