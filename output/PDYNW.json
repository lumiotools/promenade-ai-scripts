While it is early days, we are seeing strong interest from companies globally that are looking to accelerate operations while driving efficiency by expanding the jobs done by robots”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n  * Minimal viable product (MVP) version of Palladyne IQ released for customer evaluation and trials -- expect commercial launch of Palladyne IQ during the second half of 2024.\n  * Successful completion of first on-site trial of Palladyne IQ at a customer location.\n  * Revenues increased by 112% in the second quarter 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 and increased 72% in the first half of 2024 as compared to the first half of 2023.\n  * 73% decrease in operating expenses, including restructuring charges, and 81% decrease in net loss in the second quarter 2024 as compared to the second quarter 2023.\n  * 66% decrease in operating expenses, including restructuring charges and 75% decrease in net loss in the first half 2024 as compared to the first half 2023.\n  * Key executives and business leaders with prior experience at ABB, Delta Airlines, iRobot and Softbank have joined the company to drive commercialization and customer acquisition.\n\n\n\n“Palladyne AI makes robots smarter to do jobs that have historically been too complex to automate. While it is early days, we are seeing strong interest from companies globally that are looking to accelerate operations while driving efficiency by expanding the jobs done by robots,” said Ben Wolff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Palladyne AI Corp.\n\nOur AI/ML Software Platform enhances the utility and functionality of third-party stationary and mobile robotic systems by enabling these systems to quickly observe, learn, reason and act in structured, unstructured and dynamic environments. Our software platform is designed with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies that enable robotic systems to perceive their environment and quickly adapt to changing circumstances by generalizing (i.e., learning) from their past experience using dynamic real-time operations “on the edge” (i.e., on the robotic system) without extensive programming and with minimal robot training. We are developing two products based on our AI/ML Software Platform: Palladyne IQ for use with both stationary industrial robots and cobots, and Palladyne Pilot for use with mobile robotic platforms such as drones and unmanned ground vehicles. During the second quarter 2024, we released our MVP version (i.e., a version of the product that is capable of performing the minimal functions necessary but that does not have all the features of and has not been fully tested, debugged or refined into our planned product for general commercial release) of Palladyne IQ and have had our first trial of Palladyne IQ at a customer location.\n\nWe believe our software’s closed-loop autonomy approach is the key to expedite robot training, expand the tasks that a robot can perform, reduce costly workflow stoppages, mitigate downtimes and reduce human labor requirements. We anticipate that this “human-like” ability to learn and adapt will be a key differentiator in helping our customers achieve and maintain optimal productivity in dynamic or unstructured environments, where new situations and unexpected challenges are more likely to cause delays and costly downtime.\n\n“We have designed our AI/ML Software Platform to be hardware agnostic in order to be compatible with most industrial robots being sold today,” continued Mr. Wolff. “We have so far met our key product development milestones on time in 2024, and expect to release the commercial version of Palladyne IQ in the second half of this year. We intend to continue product testing, enhance product features and functionality and work with prospective customers throughout the remainder of this year with a goal of generating revenues from Palladyne IQ product sales beginning in the first half of 2025.”\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nWe are pleased to announce that our efforts to reduce expenses, including our decision to focus on our AI/ML Software Platform and suspend our hardware product development efforts and the two reductions in force announced in 2023, have resulted in a 73% decrease in operating expenses, including restructuring charges, and 81% decrease in net loss in the second quarter 2024 as compared to the second quarter 2023, and a 66% decrease in operating expenses, including restructuring charges, and 75% decrease in net loss in the first half 2024 as compared to the first half 2023. As a result, we have been able to dramatically reduce our use of cash, ending the second quarter of 2024 with a cash (including cash equivalents and marketable securities) balance of $25.8 million.\n\nRevenues increased by 112% in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 and increased by 72% in the first half of 2024 as compared to the first half of 2023. The increase in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 was due to accelerated progress on and completion of certain milestones in our product development contracts. The increase in the first half of 2024 was primarily due to legacy product sales in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n**About Palladyne AI Corp.**\n\nPalladyne AI Corp.

(NASDAQ: PDYN and PDYNW) (“Palladyne AI”), a developer of artificial intelligence software for robotic platforms in the commercial and defense sectors, today announced recent key business and financial achievements.\n\n> “Palladyne AI makes robots smarter to do jobs that have historically been too complex to automate. While it is early days, we are seeing strong interest from companies globally that are looking to accelerate operations while driving efficiency by expanding the jobs done by robots”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n  * Minimal viable product (MVP) version of Palladyne IQ released for customer evaluation and trials -- expect commercial launch of Palladyne IQ during the second half of 2024.\n  * Successful completion of first on-site trial of Palladyne IQ at a customer location.\n  * Revenues increased by 112% in the second quarter 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 and increased 72% in the first half of 2024 as compared to the first half of 2023.\n  * 73% decrease in operating expenses, including restructuring charges, and 81% decrease in net loss in the second quarter 2024 as compared to the second quarter 2023.\n  * 66% decrease in operating expenses, including restructuring charges and 75% decrease in net loss in the first half 2024 as compared to the first half 2023.\n  * Key executives and business leaders with prior experience at ABB, Delta Airlines, iRobot and Softbank have joined the company to drive commercialization and customer acquisition.\n\n\n\n“Palladyne AI makes robots smarter to do jobs that have historically been too complex to automate. While it is early days, we are seeing strong interest from companies globally that are looking to accelerate operations while driving efficiency by expanding the jobs done by robots,” said Ben Wolff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Palladyne AI Corp.\n\nOur AI/ML Software Platform enhances the utility and functionality of third-party stationary and mobile robotic systems by enabling these systems to quickly observe, learn, reason and act in structured, unstructured and dynamic environments. Our software platform is designed with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies that enable robotic systems to perceive their environment and quickly adapt to changing circumstances by generalizing (i.e., learning) from their past experience using dynamic real-time operations “on the edge” (i.e., on the robotic system) without extensive programming and with minimal robot training. We are developing two products based on our AI/ML Software Platform: Palladyne IQ for use with both stationary industrial robots and cobots, and Palladyne Pilot for use with mobile robotic platforms such as drones and unmanned ground vehicles. During the second quarter 2024, we released our MVP version (i.e., a version of the product that is capable of performing the minimal functions necessary but that does not have all the features of and has not been fully tested, debugged or refined into our planned product for general commercial release) of Palladyne IQ and have had our first trial of Palladyne IQ at a customer location.\n\nWe believe our software’s closed-loop autonomy approach is the key to expedite robot training, expand the tasks that a robot can perform, reduce costly workflow stoppages, mitigate downtimes and reduce human labor requirements. We anticipate that this “human-like” ability to learn and adapt will be a key differentiator in helping our customers achieve and maintain optimal productivity in dynamic or unstructured environments, where new situations and unexpected challenges are more likely to cause delays and costly downtime.\n\n“We have designed our AI/ML Software Platform to be hardware agnostic in order to be compatible with most industrial robots being sold today,” continued Mr. Wolff. “We have so far met our key product development milestones on time in 2024, and expect to release the commercial version of Palladyne IQ in the second half of this year. We intend to continue product testing, enhance product features and functionality and work with prospective customers throughout the remainder of this year with a goal of generating revenues from Palladyne IQ product sales beginning in the first half of 2025.”\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nWe are pleased to announce that our efforts to reduce expenses, including our decision to focus on our AI/ML Software Platform and suspend our hardware product development efforts and the two reductions in force announced in 2023, have resulted in a 73% decrease in operating expenses, including restructuring charges, and 81% decrease in net loss in the second quarter 2024 as compared to the second quarter 2023, and a 66% decrease in operating expenses, including restructuring charges, and 75% decrease in net loss in the first half 2024 as compared to the first half 2023. As a result, we have been able to dramatically reduce our use of cash, ending the second quarter of 2024 with a cash (including cash equivalents and marketable securities) balance of $25.8 million.\n\nRevenues increased by 112% in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 and increased by 72% in the first half of 2024 as compared to the first half of 2023. The increase in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2023 was due to accelerated progress on and completion of certain milestones in our product development contracts. The increase in the first half of 2024 was primarily due to legacy product sales in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n**About Palladyne AI Corp.**\n\nPalladyne AI Corp. (NASDAQ: PDYN) has developed an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) software platform poised to revolutionize the capabilities of robots, enabling them to observe, learn, reason, and act in a manner akin to human intelligence. Our AI/ML Software Platform empowers robots to perceive variations or changes in the real-world environment, enabling them to autonomously maneuver and manipulate objects accurately in response.\n\nThe Palladyne AI/ML Software Platform operates on the edge and dramatically reduces the significant effort required to program and deploy robots enabling industrial robots and collaborative robots (cobots) to quickly achieve autonomous capabilities even in dynamic and or complex environments. Designed to enable robotic systems to perceive their environment and quickly adapt to changing circumstances by generalizing (i.e., learning) from their past experience using dynamic real-time operations “on the edge” (i.e., on the robotic system) without extensive programming and with minimal robot training. Palladyne AI believes its software has wide application, including in industries such as automotive, aviation, construction, defense, general manufacturing, infrastructure inspection, logistics and warehousing. Its applicability extends beyond traditional robotics to include Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). Palladyne AI’s approach is expected to elevate the return on investment associated with a diverse range of machines that are fixed, fly, float or roll.\n\nBy enabling autonomy, reducing programming complexity and enhancing efficiency, we are paving the way for a future where machines can excel in tasks that were once considered beyond their reach.\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.palladyneai.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.palladyneai.com&esheet=54105660&newsitemid=20240807704800&lan=en-US&anchor=www.palladyneai.com&index=2&md5=9504f8407f66536158396f321e913aaa) and connect with us on LinkedIn at [www.linkedin.com/company/palladyneaicorp](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fpalladyneaicorp%2F&esheet=54105660&newsitemid=20240807704800&lan=en-US&anchor=www.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fpalladyneaicorp&index=3&md5=9b6e2e24823a01e36bc2c9cec7bab612).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the timing of commercial product release and product revenues, capabilities or future capabilities of the Company’s software platform and products, the benefits of the software platform and products and the industries that could benefit from them, the impact of the software platform and products on robotics, future product development efforts and engagement with potential customers and the applicability of the software platform to different kinds of machines (such as UAVs, UGVs and ROVs and different available industrial robots).

We made the decisions to suspend our hardware commercialization efforts, implement a significant reduction in force and focus our resources on our AI/ML platform.\n\n“By de-coupling our advanced AI/ML software from our own robotic systems, we believe we have the opportunity to reach a much broader market more quickly by targeting existing deployed robotic systems and new sales of third-party systems. We can provide customers with the solutions they need through the intellectual capital that Sarcos brings to the table, but without requiring significant investment in hardware development and production.\n\n“In addition, as previously announced, we already have AI software-related contracts with various U.S. government agencies, including a $13.8 million, four-year development contract with the U.S. Airforce to advance artificial intelligence and machine learning software. The contract supports the development, integration and validation of our AI and ML software framework for success-based learning, which will allow robots to perceive their environment, determine reasonable behavior in unforeseen situations, and quickly change their actions.\n\n“In connection with our plans to focus on robotic AI/ML software, we are realigning our resources, including taking steps to reduce our headcount and operating expenses, which we expect to result in a significant reduction in our monthly cash usage after the restructuring is completed.”\n\n**Q3 Financial Results**\n\nThird quarter 2023 total revenue was $1.8 million, compared to $4.7 million during the third quarter of 2022. Revenues decreased on a year-over-year basis as a result of fewer product development contracts being worked during the current year, offset slightly by an increase in product revenue.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2023 were $32.6 million, compared to operating expenses of $31.9 million during the third quarter of 2022. In connection with the July 12, 2023, announced restructuring, the Company incurred charges of $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, including $1.1 million in severance and benefit payments and $4.4 million due to the acceleration of stock-based compensation expense resulting from the early termination of the Company's redemption right over certain shares held by the Company's former Chief Operating Officer in connection with the termination of his employment. Further, reflecting the restructuring actions announced today, the Company incurred $5.7 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter 2023, including a write-down of inventory of $5.2 million and $0.5 million related to the write-down of certain assets. Cost of revenue decreased to $1.2 million in the third quarter 2023 as compared to $3.6 million in the third quarter 2022, mainly due to decreased labor and material expenses charged to product development contracts. Third quarter 2023 gross margin was 33%, compared to 23% in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased to $10.0 million in the third quarter 2023 as compared to $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2022, due mainly to reduced third party professional service expenses connected with our prioritization of efforts. General and administrative expenses decreased to $7.6 million in Q3 2023 as compared to $14.6 million in the third quarter 2022, primarily due to decreased stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nThird quarter 2023 net loss was $29.0 million or $1.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $22.5 million or $0.89 per share in the third quarter of the prior year.\n\nThird quarter 2023 non-GAAP net loss was $17.0 million or $0.66 per diluted share. Reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP net loss is included at the end of this release.\n\nSarcos ended the quarter with $55.1 million in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\n**Financial Guidance** Due to the many variables associated with the organizational and business changes announced today, we will not provide revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect to end the year with approximately $39 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Further, we expect net cash usage should average approximately $1.6 million per month in 2024, which could be reduced further by revenue realized from customer purchases of the service.\n\nWe anticipate incurring additional restructuring expenses, related to the restructuring actions taken during 2023, in the range of $22 million to $24 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. These expenses include approximately $4 million dollars in personnel expenses such as salaries, wages, benefits and severance related to the eliminated headcount. The remainder will be non-cash expenses related to expected accelerated amortization of intangible and other assets due to the strategic shift initiated during the fourth quarter.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nA conference call and audio webcast with analysts and investors will be held today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time/1:30 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the results and answer questions.\n\n  * To access the conference call, please pre-register using this [link](https://register.vevent.com/register/BIf7412d20aa1f4671b75b847eca12bc65).

presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have presented in this release non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share, each of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nWe define non-GAAP net loss as our GAAP measured net loss excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense, gain on forgiveness of notes payable, gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative instruments and warrant liabilities, expenses related to a business combination, asset write-down and restructuring expenses, goodwill impairment and other non-recurring non-operating expenses. We define non-GAAP net loss per share as non-GAAP net loss divided by weighted average outstanding shares.\n\nThe most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP net loss is net loss. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP net loss per share is net loss per share. We believe excluding the impact of the previously listed items in calculating non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance. We monitor, and have presented in this release, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share because they are each a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and to establish budgets. We believe non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we include in net loss but not in non-GAAP net loss. Accordingly, we believe non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share provide useful information to investors, analysts and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share rather than net loss and net loss per share, which is for each the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculations of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share when they report their operating results, limiting the usefulness of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share for comparative purposes.\n\nIn addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share as tools for comparison.\n\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP net loss to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**​**| **​**| **2023**| **2022**| **​**| **2023**| **2022**  \nNet loss| $| (28,981| )| $| (22,499| )| $| (79,117| )| $| (64,819| )  \nNon-GAAP adjustments:  \nStock-based compensation expense| 1,679| 8,466| 6,413| 29,586  \nGain on warrant liability| (96| )| (1,484| )| (99| )| (12,011| )  \nAsset write-down and restructuring(1)| 11,222| —| 16,328| —  \nEmployee Retention Credit| (876| )| —| (1,895| )| —  \nExpenses related to business combinations(2)| —| (591| )| —| 1,935  \nIncome tax benefit related to business combinations| —| (2,465| )| —| (4,071| )  \nNon-GAAP net loss| $| (17,052| )| $| (18,573| )| $| (58,370| )| $| (49,380| )  \nNet loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| $| (1.13| )| $| (0.89| )| $| (3.09| )| $| (2.68| )  \nNon-GAAP net loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| $| (0.66| )| $| (0.74| )| $| (2.28| )| $| (2.04| )  \nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| 25,706,023| 25,156,756| 25,563,895| 24,180,445  \n  \n1) Expenses related to our asset write-down and restructuring for the three months ended September 30, 2023, includes $1.1 million in cash severance and benefit payments, $4.4 million related to the acceleration of stock-based compensation expense, $5.2 million due to the write-down of inventory, and a $0.5 million impairment charge for certain assets as a result of our product development reprioritization.

We believe we have sufficient liquidity to operate into 2025 without additional financing.”\n\n**Financial results** Second quarter 2023 total revenue was $1.3 million, compared to $3.0 million during the second quarter of 2022.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the second quarter of 2023 were $31.2 million, compared to operating expenses of $32.0 million during the second quarter of 2022. In connection with the July 12, 2023, announced restructuring, the Company incurred charges of $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2023, including $4.4 million due to the write-down of inventory and $0.7 million related to the impairment of certain fixed assets. Cost of revenue decreased to $0.9 million in Q2 2023 as compared to $3.1 million in Q2 2022, mainly due to decreased labor and material expenses charged to product development contracts. Second quarter 2023 gross margin was 26%, compared to negative 4% in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased to $11.7 million as compared to $7.6 million in the second quarter of 2022, due to increased labor and overhead expense as a result of increased headcount (due in part to the RE2 acquisition) and increased direct materials charges. General and administrative expenses decreased to $8.3 million in Q2 2023 as compared to $18.1 million in Q2 2022, primarily due to decreased stock-based compensation.\n\nSecond quarter 2023 net loss was $28.7 million or $1.12 per share, compared to a net loss of $23.1 million or $0.95 per share in the second quarter of the prior year.\n\nSecond quarter 2023 non-GAAP net loss was $21.9 million or $0.86 per diluted share. Reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP net loss is included at the end of this release.\n\nPlease note, on July 5, 2023, Sarcos effected a 1-for-6 reverse stock of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split.\n\nSarcos ended the quarter with $75.1 million in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\n**Financial guidance**\n\nSarcos believes that its third quarter 2023 total revenue will range between $1.1 and $1.4 million. The Company anticipates incurring additional restructuring expense related to the reduction of headcount of approximately $6.0 million, net, during the third quarter of 2023, which includes approximately $1.5 million in cash severance and benefit payments.

 \nProduct Revenue| 3| 56  \nRevenue, net| $| 1,277| $| 3,038  \n  \n**SARCOS TECHNOLOGY AND ROBOTICS CORPORATION****NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES****(Unaudited)**\n\nTo supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have presented in this release non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share, each of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nWe define non-GAAP net loss as our GAAP measured net loss excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense, gain on forgiveness of notes payable, gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative instruments and warrant liabilities, expenses related to a business combination, asset write-down and restructuring, goodwill impairment and other non-recurring non-operating expenses. We define non-GAAP net loss per share as non-GAAP net loss divided by weighted average outstanding shares.\n\nThe most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP net loss is net loss. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP net loss per share is net loss per share. We believe excluding the impact of the previously listed items in calculating non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance. We monitor, and have presented in this release, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share because they are each a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and to establish budgets. We believe non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we include in net loss but not in non-GAAP net loss. Accordingly, we believe non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share provide useful information to investors, analysts and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share rather than net loss and net loss per share, which is for each the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculations of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share when they report their operating results, limiting the usefulness of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share for comparative purposes.\n\nIn addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share as tools for comparison.\n\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP net loss to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,**| **For the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**​**| **​**| **2023**| **2022**| **​**| **2023**| **2022**  \nNet loss| $| (28,660| )| $| (23,118| )| $| (50,136| )| $| (42,320| )  \nNon-GAAP adjustments:  \nStock-based compensation expense| 2,070| 10,270| 4,734| 21,120  \nGain on warrant liability| (439| )| (4,113| )| (3| )| (10,527| )  \nAsset write-down and restructuring (1)| 5,106| —| 5,106| —  \nEmployee Retention Credit| —| —| (1,019| )| —  \nExpenses related to business combinations (2)| —| 1,053| —| 2,526  \nIncome tax benefit related to business combinations| —| (1,606| )| —| (1,606| )  \nNon-GAAP net loss| $| (21,923| )| $| (17,514| )| $| (41,318| )| $| (30,807| )  \nNet loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| $| (1.12| )| $| (0.95| )| $| (1.97| )| $| (1.79| )  \nNon-GAAP net loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| $| (0.86| )| $| (0.72| )| $| (1.62| )| $| (1.30| )  \nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| 25,512,057| 24,379,549| 25,491,654| 23,685,766  \n  \n  * Expenses related to our asset write-down and restructuring activities included $4.4 million due to the write-down of inventory and $0.7 million related to the impairment of certain fixed assets.\n  * Expenses related to our business combination with RE2, Inc., which are included within general and administrative expenses within the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\n\n**Investor Contact:** Moriah Shilton310.622.8251STRC@finprofiles.com\n\n**Press Contact** mediarelations@sarcos.com\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/Y2JiMjkyNzItZTI0Mi00ZjI0LWEyNjItNGY1YjFhZjYzYWYzLTEyMTk4NTE=/tiny/Sarcos-Corp-.png)\n\n## Investor Tools\n\n[ Print Page]()\n\n[ Email Alerts](/ir-resources/email-alerts)\n\n[ Email Page]()\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://investor.palladyneai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarcos-technology-and-robotics-corporation-announces-second-0&t=Palladyne AI Corp. - Sarcos Technology and Robotics Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Palladyne AI Corp. - Sarcos Technology and Robotics Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results+https://investor.palladyneai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarcos-technology-and-robotics-corporation-announces-second-0 \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://investor.palladyneai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarcos-technology-and-robotics-corporation-announces-second-0&title=Palladyne AI Corp. - Sarcos Technology and Robotics Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [Google+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://investor.palladyneai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarcos-technology-and-robotics-corporation-announces-second-0?&t=Palladyne AI Corp. - Sarcos Technology and Robotics Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results \"GooglePlus\")\n\n\n"

Our participation in these events reinforce our commitment to the opportunities we continue to pursue in the Aerospace, Construction, and Underwater industries, which we estimate represent a collective global TAM opportunity of approximately $185 billion in 2025. I have tremendous confidence that our key end markets are ready for our products and are excited about how robotics will revolutionize labor utilization and worker safety.\n\n“We are guiding for full year 2023 revenue to increase by 64% at the midpoint of our guidance, and will continue to optimize operating expenses, all leading to our goal of exiting 2024 on pace to be cash flow positive in 2025.” **Financial results** First quarter 2023 total revenue was $2.3 million, compared to $0.7 million during the first quarter of 2022. The increase was due to Product Development Contract revenue increases.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2023 were $25.5 million, compared to operating expenses of $26.4 million during the first quarter of 2022. The overall decrease was mainly due to reduced stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses increased to $9.4 million as compared to $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2022, due to increased labor and overhead expense as a result of increased headcount (due in part to the RE2 acquisition) and increased direct materials charges. Cost of revenue increased to $1.8 million in Q1 2023 as compared to $0.5 million in Q1 2022, mainly due to the costs associated with Product Development Contracts and the addition of RE2.\n\nFirst quarter 2023 net loss was $21.5 million or $0.14 per share, compared to a net loss of $19.2 million or $0.14 per share in the first quarter of the prior year.\n\nFirst quarter 2023 non-GAAP net loss was $19.4 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP net loss is included at the end of this release.\n\nSarcos ended the quarter with $94.7 million in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\n**Financial guidance**\n\nSarcos believes that its second quarter 2023 total revenue will be approximately $2.1 million, of which approximately $400,000 will be revenue from Product sales. For the full year 2023, the Company continues to expect total revenue to range between $23 and $25 million. Product Development Contract Revenue is expected to be approximately 80% of the mix and Product Revenue the remaining approximately 20%. Product sales are expected to begin to ramp up in the second half of 2023.\n\nTurning to operating expenses, Sarcos believes its research and development expenses will decrease in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to decreased use of third-party research and development resources as the Company continues to develop and refine its existing products and further enhance its efforts on our future products and software. With the exception of stock-based compensation expense, Sarcos expects its general and administrative expenses in 2023 to increase slightly due to commercialization efforts and public company compliance requirements. Sales and marketing will increase in 2023 in line with the expected revenue growth in the future.\n\nThe Company estimates cash used in operating activities to average approximately $5 million per month during the second quarter of 2023. As of March 31, 2023, the Company has an unconditional purchase commitment of $4.0 million, which is related to operational expenses and all of which is expected to be settled during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company expects this amount to be paid in two equal installments, one during each of the second and third quarters 2023.\n\nFor the full year of 2023, the Company is satisfied with its liquidity and currently has no plans to do an equity financing in 2023. The Company believes it has sufficient capital to fund its business for at least the next 12 months.\n\n**Conference call and webcast** A conference call and audio webcast with analysts and investors will be held today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time/1:30 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the results and answer questions.\n\n  * To access the conference call, please pre-register using this [link](https://register.vevent.com/register/BI95b1a2cbb798401fa8ea8f224a3df4d3).

Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nWe define non-GAAP net loss as our GAAP measured net loss excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense, gain on forgiveness of notes payable, gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative instruments and warrant liabilities, expenses related to a business combination, goodwill impairment and other non-recurring non-operating expenses. We define non-GAAP net loss per share as non-GAAP net loss divided by weighted average outstanding shares.\n\nThe most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP net loss is net loss. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP net loss per share is net loss per share. We believe excluding the impact of the previously listed items in calculating non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance. We monitor, and have presented in this release, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share because they are each a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and to establish budgets. We believe non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we include in net loss but not in non-GAAP net loss. Accordingly, we believe non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share provide useful information to investors, analysts and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share rather than net loss and net loss per share, which is for each the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculations of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share when they report their operating results, limiting the usefulness of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share for comparative purposes.\n\nIn addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share as tools for comparison.\n\nThe following table reconciles non-GAAP net loss to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n**Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n---  \n**​**| **​**| **2023**| **2022**  \nNet loss| $| (21,476| )| $| (19,202| )  \nNon-GAAP adjustments:  \nStock-based compensation expense| 2,664| 10,850  \nLoss (gain) on warrant liability| 436| (6,414| )  \nExpenses related to business combinations(1)| —| 1,473  \nEmployee Retention Credit| (1,019| )| —  \nNon-GAAP net loss| $| (19,395| )| $| (13,293| )  \nNet loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| $| (0.14| )| $| (0.14| )  \nNon-GAAP net loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| $| (0.13| )| $| (0.10| )  \nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share  \nBasic and diluted| 152,827,729| 137,908,690  \n  \n(1)| Expenses related to our business combination with RE2, Inc., which are included within general and administrative expenses within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Investor Contact:** Moriah Shilton310.622.8251STRC@finprofiles.com\n\n**Press Contact** mediarelations@sarcos.com\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZTZhMjY0NWEtY2VkMC00NTkyLWFkM2YtZWRmZjNkZDY5ZWM0LTEyMTk4NTE=/tiny/Sarcos-Corp-.png)\n\n## Investor Tools\n\n[ Print Page]()\n\n[ Email Alerts](/ir-resources/email-alerts)\n\n[ Email Page]()\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://investor.palladyneai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarcos-technology-and-robotics-corporation-announces-first-0&t=Palladyne AI Corp. - Sarcos Technology and Robotics Corporation Announces First Quarter 2023 Financial Results \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Palladyne AI Corp. - Sarcos Technology and Robotics Corporation Announces First Quarter 2023 Financial Results+https://investor.palladyneai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarcos-technology-and-robotics-corporation-announces-first-0 \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://investor.palladyneai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarcos-technology-and-robotics-corporation-announces-first-0&title=Palladyne AI Corp. - Sarcos Technology and Robotics Corporation Announces First Quarter 2023 Financial Results \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [Google+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://investor.palladyneai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sarcos-technology-and-robotics-corporation-announces-first-0?&t=Palladyne AI Corp. - Sarcos Technology and Robotics Corporation Announces First Quarter 2023 Financial Results \"GooglePlus\")\n\n\n"
