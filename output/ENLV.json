(Nasdaq: ENLV, the “Company”), a clinical-stage macrophage reprogramming immunotherapy company, today announced the completion of the dosing and initial follow-up period for the first patient in its Phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential therapeutic effect of Allocetra™ following injection into an affected joint in patients with psoriatic arthritis. No safety concerns were recorded following the dosing of the first patient.\n\nThe trial currently plans to recruit six patients who have insufficiently responded to conventional therapies for psoriatic arthritis. The primary safety endpoint will measure the frequency and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events, and secondary endpoints will include assessments of change from baseline in pain and other parameters of disease activity for up to 12 months following administration of Allocetra™.\n\nDr. Oren Hershkovitz, CEO, commented, “Complementing our ongoing clinical trial in osteoarthritis, which is a low-grade chronic inflammatory joint disease, this new study provides an opportunity to assess Allocetra™ in a high-grade inflammatory joint disease such as psoriatic arthritis, which is another indication with poor treatment alternatives that we believe potentially presents a substantial market opportunity for Enlivex.”\n\n**ABOUT PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS****1**\n\nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that typically occurs in individuals with psoriasis, a skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches. PsA can affect any joint in the body, leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling. It can also cause inflammation in other parts of the body, including the eyes, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. The global market for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) treatments, valued at approximately $10.8 billion in 2023, is estimated to grow substantially, with certain projections indicating the market will reach $20.5 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4% from 2024 to 2032. Other analysis anticipates the PsA treatment market will increase from $9.97 billion in 2023 to $24.87 billion by 2031, representing a CAGR of 12.1% from 2024 to 2031. The current landscape of PsA treatment is marked by significant challenges, including limited efficacy, side effects, high costs, long-term safety concerns, underdiagnosis, and issues with patient adherence. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing research and development of more effective, safer, and affordable treatments, along with efforts to improve diagnosis and patient education.\n\n1 [https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/psoriatic-arthritis](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4r84kkggGE3kmR7L-GNrP6QwV15FijzE2bmERC6BvvwfW3HmfKAKsUe5BBAH6sJObiZgPsCrjuUZ4QJuoOlMg6zby6UX5yfbFaOrgloqVU45g1uDlUF0-fM1-qhnYGsFV6Zpw-NpeUOJQT4KFMA7RVFYLHeSgkv4K1-yBGNMl2kZKBhn2BE3C1H22Da7m-VUxcCIwYadhUTLISyvnNIlnfXq1P_hg-vLmHq9VwLi6gy3vL2ZNlDpRadksAfPLsWpSmnc8JO-mUf1Iz3vouLBr0TGzNBmTT1sxBuxjVXKEESgI34_5Qqnqa3FMXQVrfp979K0sBH4FJAgNtsgZoF1yUXdUo9olLKR-uZBYjZewZr8WIQ-bEOBtbi1tTnqf5N29TQ-A0kExI0_CCS8L9omvoq4t3sdLqlXIuUOo8plujYC-0cISdRtjlMwsQplNcBVK9yBt7CDdy-Nlf352-HWG0QN46EEVQPlPE4A47h1w3I=) [https://www.reportsandinsights.com/report/psoriatic-arthritis-psa-treatment-market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4r84kkggGE3kmR7L-GNrPxsnQAtilCHorodqWF07HUx-kb3bDFtkvlU1TtU_Wyhq6tf0PLp9_9L2hY_ZvVIE0VyTwMOvUM7ND8uH6wRfqVp-n7wUunaUqN0CCppo2p1aMOXvlgVRTm70b2HUHkviZ55IjVVe0XL1UYizTiwGB811xWZ6bdj532x1D3l60cw1cfETYaiA54vTZzsK_PqyxMwV_4VBv9k4znkdHDclqMc2YHW2YnFwStXrwQYLGz_1FVit3YM2tRx2Ml2zsXzE0DEECMk3dYBP090bQtC6GwVzyPzQJkUg5pznNuwHvWdoJCDhD0oR8gmbcyMmUw0amX39HIGiu5cODCULarfdQMsmVz6vgaUvAGVidUyBXIr8ujjPnKvrQwFc51IO22fLQ89uAXjtHU2OeZVR_pxkzo3Lm8YvXDwje0h0MygD17S1SOpIdT-tdl2eU6rd88Vit8pPbZr1DUZzvKXBPonmDjzVWM4nbZnv7_QCNi15nT3oY0KAGEkreFI8rd7Op5DCeAE5LxSCYrpZfMn5JDLEO54=) [https://www.snsinsider.com/reports/psoriatic-arthritis-treatment-market-3223](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4r84kkggGE3kmR7L-GNrP_aQYQFexMYrKE_S1fetK-5UDTyDyQb1HbvePDPOLr4WLaEozg8kKWqPkuTkEtJS6aZohJyHAfQ1Yd_46BQ-yupy_rTJKfZsl49sDHdm2_grD9odBDLiI4YFsyg3YVf0eInPPqS1Y38V1OdwJzwRcK4d9pSSY6iCttJr3acwcYwPXHD57vlyLpEhMklxKSjmjMcw5btxZXf6sAst4qW4KaL-aUIalGtf8831fJth5WkifRwkeKHdRHqQpiGbITAJ3dLm4oS4civkI2fG5wFl17DBBBqij_L8YshKCF368nuq46z9gAejRVZgCGwQuIMjqo5INP3p08TKem-8ZkwqmE161U2cjI_5pTUic7WARpVvHsSuook3kpv_ADh6fwS9xPXQtMU8nua3GXJoBaGHfpwwGJ7D6aRe-k4yH-To5WmKLH6VeYx3Wq11v10DYM4Ve2xSOYmWO5cypf49K0J0vbMWZoI1ficnWDEt54eOTtCR9KrPPfiI5PMsgiGs1lRKrg==)\n\n**ABOUT ENLIVEX**\n\nEnlivex is a clinical stage macrophage reprogramming immunotherapy company developing Allocetra™, a universal, off-the-shelf cell therapy designed to reprogram macrophages into their homeostatic state.

The analysis showed reductions, by day 28, in organ failure scores (SOFA)\nof 90% for sepsis patients whose infection source was urinary tract (UTI), 68% for patients whose infection source was\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia, and 36% for patients whose infection source was internal abdominal.\nA potential indication of relative efficacy is demonstrated in a population of high risk UTI patients.\nUp to 31 percent of sepsis cases start as UTIs, representing up to 9.8 million cases annually in the U.S. and Europe, leading to as many as 1.6\nmillion deaths2. This a substantial target market for a potential commercialization of Allocetra™ in sepsis, and the Company intends to consider,\nupon reviewing the totality of the data, a potential follow-on, randomized, controlled study of solely high risk UTI sepsis population.\nThe interpretation of efficacy in other populations is challenged by the difference in risk profile of the Allocetra™ group.\nSafety: No serious adverse events were reported as related to study treatment, and overall fewer events were considered related\nto AllocetraTMcompared to placebo (9.3% vs 15.6%). All deaths were determined to be unrelated to treatment, as further confirmed by the\nindependent DSMB. No safety signals were detected.\nPatient follow-up is ongoing to complete 12-month evaluation.\n1 -Compared with recently-completed sizable clinical trials –Revival Phase III (2024),\nAstonish Phase IIb (2023),Karakike(2019) –in which mortality rates were in the range of 23%–\n30%.\n2 -Management of Urosepsis in 2018, Bonkatet.
