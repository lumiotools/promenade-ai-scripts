Slides](/media/vfxmjtb5/audiocodes-3q-2024-earnings-call-supplementary-slides.pdf)\n\n## Details\n\n**Or Yehuda, Israel – November 6, 2024 – AudioCodes (NASDAQ: AUDC) Press Release**\n\nAudioCodes (NASDAQ: AUDC), a leading provider of unified communications voice, contact center and conversational AI applications and services for enterprises, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $60.2 million compared to $61.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nEBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.9 million compared to $6.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOn a Non-GAAP basis, EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $7.9 million compared to $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income was $2.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $4.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOn a Non-GAAP basis, net income was $4.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $8.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income excludes: (i) share-based compensation expenses; (ii) amortization expenses related to intangible assets; (iii) expenses related to deferred payments in connection with the acquisition of Callverso Ltd; (iv) financial income (expenses) related to exchange rate differences in connection with revaluation of assets and liabilities in non-dollar denominated currencies; (v) tax impact which relates to our Non-GAAP adjustments; and (vi) in Q1 2024 non-cash lease expense which is required to be recorded during the quarter even though this is a free rent period under the lease for the Company's new headquarters. A reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis is provided in the tables that accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this press release.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $7.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long-term financial investments were $88.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $106.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long-term financial investments was the result of the use of cash for the continued repurchasing of the Company's ordinary shares pursuant to its share repurchase program and the payment of a cash dividend during each of the first and third quarters of 2024 and purchase of property and equipment related to leasehold improvements of our new corporate headquarter in Israel, offset, in part, by cash from operating activities.\n\n\"I am pleased to report we have successfully executed against our strategic priorities this quarter, as we continue to make progress in our long-term goal of leading the voice services market for the UCaaS and CX markets. We continued our transformation to become a cloud software and services company with a higher proportion of recurring revenue vs. legacy perpetual revenues,\" said Shabtai Adlersberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of AudioCodes.\n\nThird quarter services revenues grew 6.4% year-over-year and accounted for 53.9% of revenues, the highest on record for us. Fueling the strength of our services revenue stream as our primary growth engines were Live managed services (consisting of Live Teams and Live CX) and conversational AI. Specifically, Live Teams business grew 21% year over year and accounted for 44% of total Microsoft business compared to 37% a year ago. On conversational AI, third quarter dollar value of contracts signed increased roughly 50% vs the year ago period.\n\nOur success in building Live managed services and recurring revenue stream has translated to strong year-over-year ARR growth of 40%, ending 3Q at $60 million ARR, up from $48 million exiting 2023. This success is owed to the trust we have built throughout the years with partners and enterprise customers in the voice services space. There is no better proof than our long-standing multi-year partnership with AT&T in North America, leveraging our expertise in providing secure voice connectivity to help their business customers onboard to Microsoft Teams. This fruitful partnership has contributed multi-millions of annual recurring revenues over the last several years.\n\nSpeaking of conversational AI, strong operational momentum continues, driven by long-term tailwind of infusing AI into UC and CX workflows in customers' inexorable demand to drive ongoing productivity gains. Accordingly, we have seen significant pick-up in pipeline activities across our entire conversational AI suite, including Voca CIC, our AI first CX solution for Microsoft Teams, SaaS Recording solutions such as Meeting Insights and interaction recording, and Voice AI Connect.\n\nOverall, we delivered on our business priorities in the quarter, with the strength in our Live recurring businesses buttressing the healthy overall pipeline for our major practices such as Microsoft business, CX and Conversational AI. We believe this bodes well for seeing improved top-line growth performance as we head into 2025 and beyond,\" concluded Mr. Adlersberg.\n\n### Share Buy Back Program and Cash Dividend\n\nIn July 2024, the Company received court approval in Israel to purchase up to an aggregate amount of $20 million of additional ordinary shares. The court approval also permits AudioCodes to declare a dividend out of any part of this amount. The approval is valid through January 1, 2025.\n\nOn July 30, 2024, the Company declared a cash dividend of 18 cents per share. The dividend, in the aggregate amount of approximately $5.4 million, was paid on August 29, 2024, to all of the Company's shareholders of record on August 15, 2024.\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company acquired 332,709 of its ordinary shares under its share repurchase program for a total consideration of $3.6 million.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $11 million available under this approval for the repurchase of shares and/or declaration of cash dividends.\n\n### Conference Call & Web Cast Information\n\nAudioCodes will conduct a conference call at 8:30 A.M., Eastern Time today to discuss the Company's third quarter of 2024 operating performance, financial results and outlook.

(NASDAQ: AUDC), a leading vendor of advanced communications software, products and productivity solutions for the digital workplace, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nRevenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $60.3 million compared to $60.0 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nEBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was $6.2 million compared to $2.9 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOn a Non-GAAP basis, EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was $8.3 million compared to $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income was $3.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $1.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOn a Non-GAAP basis, net income was $5.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $5.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income excludes: (i) share-based compensation expenses; (ii) amortization expenses related to intangible assets; (iii) expenses related to deferred payments in connection with the acquisition of Callverso Ltd; (iv) financial income (expenses) related to exchange rate differences in connection with revaluation of assets and liabilities in non-dollar denominated currencies; (v) tax impact which relates to our Non-GAAP adjustments; and (vi) in Q1 2024 non-cash lease expense which is required to be recorded during the quarter even though this is a free rent period under the lease for the Company’s new headquarters. A reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis is provided in the tables that accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this press release.\n\nNet cash used by operating activities was $2.9 million for the second quarter of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long financial investments were $93.7 million as of June 30, 2024 compared to $106.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long financial investments was the result of the use of cash for the continued repurchasing of the Company’s ordinary shares pursuant to its share repurchase program and the payment of a cash dividend during the first quarter of 2024 and purchase of property and equipment related to leasehold improvements of our new corporate headquarter in Israel, offset, in part, by cash from operating activities.\n\n“I am pleased to report solid second quarter 2024 results, marked by the second consecutive quarter of positive top-line growth and ongoing momentum in our Microsoft and conversational AI businesses with sequential uptick in our legacy gateway business,” said Shabtai Adlersberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of AudioCodes.\n\nIn terms of our strategic business lines, Microsoft Teams business in the second quarter grew 3.3% year-over-year, with steady increase in the Live managed services, which grew about 35% year-over-year and reached ARR of $56 million exiting second quarter 2024. Second quarter Live business growth puts us on track to land within our full year 2024 ARR target range of $64-$70 million, representing an average approximate annual growth rate of 40% compared to 2023.\n\nIn the CX business, our healthy pipeline continues to support a positive outlook for second half and full year 2024. Conversational AI business grew over 50% year-over-year, benefiting from customers’ inexorable demand to drive innovation and deliver productivity improvements on projects in both the UC and CX space. We have witnessed progress made in several new Conversational AI activities. These include among others, Voca CIC, our AI first CX solution for Microsoft Teams, SaaS Recording solutions such as Meeting Insights and interaction recording, and in the MS Teams meeting room space.\n\nUnderlying business momentum remains strong, as we had several notable wins with marquee accounts in the quarter, from a combination of new customer additions as well as cross-sell of products and services to existing ones. Key to such cross sales success is our Live Platform for UCaaS and CCaaS, which encompasses a comprehensive stack of voice related services to the Microsoft Teams ecosystem.\n\nOverall, we delivered on our business priorities in the quarter, fostering momentum in strategic areas of our business and successfully executing on the cost rationalization initiatives. We believe this lays the foundation to drive healthy top-line growth long-term while driving significant margin expansion in 2024 and beyond,” concluded Mr. Adlersberg.\n\n### Share Buy Back Program\n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company acquired 116,453 of its ordinary shares under its share repurchase program for a total consideration of $1.2 million.\n\nIn July 2024, the Company received court approval in Israel to purchase up to an aggregate amount of $20 million of additional ordinary shares. The court approval also permits AudioCodes to declare a dividend out of any part of this amount. The approval is valid through January 1, 2025.\n\n### Cash Dividend\n\nAudioCodes also announced today that the Company’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend in the amount of 18 cents per share. The aggregate amount of the dividend is approximately $5.5 million. The dividend is payable on August 29, 2024, to all of the Company’s shareholders of record at the close of trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on August 15, 2024.\n\nIn accordance with Israeli tax law, the dividend is subject to withholding tax at source at the rate of 25% of the dividend amount payable to each shareholder of record, subject to applicable exemptions.

A reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis is provided in the tables that accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this press release.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.0 million for the first quarter of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents, long and short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long and short-term financial investments were $106.0 million as of March 31, 2024 compared to $106.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, long and short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long and short-term financial investments was the result of the use of cash for the continued repurchasing of the Company’s ordinary shares pursuant to its share repurchase program and the payment of a cash dividend during the first quarter of 2024, , offset, in part, by cash from operating activities.\n\n“Our first quarter 2024 results were highlighted by healthy revenue growth of 1.5% year-over-year and progress made in strategic areas for our business”, said Shabtai Adlersberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of AudioCodes. “In parallel with the nice growth in key business lines such as Microsoft Teams, voice services for CX, and conversational AI applications, we saw continued decline in our legacy gateway networking business, similar to trends seen in 2023. The continued transition from capex to recurring revenue model also posed revenue headwinds in the quarter.\n\nGrowth in key business lines for our future continued as planned. Microsoft business grew 8% year-over-year, with steady increase in the Live managed services, which grew 45% year-over-year, and have reached ARR of $53M exiting 1Q24. We are thus confident that we are on track to achieve our Live ARR plan of $64-$70 million for 2024. Live managed services represent now nearly 45% of our Microsoft business compared to 25% in the year ago quarter, and thus we believe the impact of our shift to recurring revenue model should ease in coming quarters. We also enjoyed growth in total contract value of Live services which grew above 45% year-over-year. Additionally, we have seen strong performance in customer experience (CX) and conversational AI (CAI), up 15% and 50% year over year, respectively. The strength has been driven by sales of our voice connectivity solutions in the CX market, and cross-selling of our Voca CIC AI first, Azure-native contact center for Teams. We are heartened by the market’s growing recognition of Voca CIC, which has recently been awarded by CX Today as the best Microsoft Teams Contact Center solution. We expect Voca CIC to be a major growth pillar of our CX and of the Company over the long-term. We believe we are the de facto leader for complete calling and contact center solutions for Microsoft Teams.\n\nOn the financial front, we enjoyed strong positive cash flow from operations in the quarter. To support further margin expansion, we have recently initiated the second phase of cost rationalization plans discussed previously.\n\nOverall, while we had a slower than expected start of revenue growth to the year due to the decline in gateways and muted business spending as a result of the elevated interest rate environment in 2024, we remain confident in our ability to sustain healthy top-line growth long-term while driving significant margin expansion in 2024 and beyond,” concluded Mr. Adlersberg.\n\n### Share Buy Back Program and Cash Dividend\n\nIn December 2023, the Company received court approval in Israel to purchase up to an aggregate amount of $20 million of additional ordinary shares. The court approval also permits AudioCodes to declare a dividend out of any part of this amount. The approval is valid through June 18, 2024.\n\nOn February 6, 2024, the Company declared a cash dividend of 18 cents per share.

digital interactions to its Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) solution, the Voca Conversational Interaction Center (CIC)\n  * The new omnichannel experience allows enterprises to provide a consistently integrated customer experience across email, webchat, and voice channels\n  * Voca CIC’s omnichannel design place special focus on agent multitasking across multiple engagement channels through a one-screen experience\n  * Enterprises adopting the new omnichannel experience can trust the reliability that comes with Voca CIC as the only CCaaS solution to offer an Azure-native integration with Teams\n  * Adding omnichannel capabilities to Voca CIC further strengthens AudioCodes Live, which offers complete calling and contact center for Microsoft Teams\n\n\n\n**Lod, Israel – March 13, 2024 – AudioCodes (NASDAQ: AUDC) Press Release**\n\n## The New Omnichannel Experience Will Support Email and Webchat in a One-screen Microsoft Teams Contact Center Built in Azure\n\n**Enterprises using Voca CIC’s omnichannel experience can now offer a consistent customer experience across multiple engagement channels all from a one-screen Microsoft Teams contact center built in Azure.**\n\nAudioCodes, a leading vendor of advanced communications software, products and productivity solutions for the digital workplace and customer experience, today announced that [Voca Conversational Interaction Center](/solutions-products/voiceai/voca-conversational-interaction-center \"Use Voca as a One-Screen Microsoft Teams Contact Center Built in Azure\") (Voca CIC) is now an omnichannel contact center for Microsoft Teams, adding email and webchat to the existing voice experience.\n\nVoca CIC is an AI-first Microsoft-certified contact center with an Azure-native integration for Microsoft Teams. With a lightweight design enabling rapid deployment and scalability, Voca CIC gives you the trusted reliability of Microsoft Teams Phone, the speed to make visual drag-and-drop changes, the flexibility of a usage-based subscription model, and the power of conversational AI provided completely out of the box. Voca CIC easily scales CX capabilities to every Teams user across the company — for the main service desk or departments beyond the contact center.\n\nWith the new omnichannel experience, Voca CIC offers the only agent status bar with individual channel-specific availability on the market. This gives contact center agents and supervisors flexibility to manage their availability across multiple digital channels and multitask based on changing demand or agent skills.\n\nThe new channel-specific status bar allows Voca CIC to automatically push digital customer interactions to agents based on availability status by channel and maximum capacity, rather than have agents hand pick interactions out of a queue. By doing so, Voca CIC’s omnichannel experience ensures digital interactions enjoy the same level of attention as voice interactions do.\n\n\"We’re delighted to deliver our first ever omnichannel experience to our customers with the addition of digital channel support in Voca CIC,\" says Gidi Adlersberg, Head of Voca CIC Business Line at AudioCodes. \"This represents another strategic evolution in Voca CIC, becoming one of the most reliable and capable contact center options in the Microsoft Teams ecosystem.”\n\n“Our innovative, bold product design comes from listening to our customers and their needs. Email and webchat are by far the most requested digital channels in the Teams CCaaS area. With our unique design, we pioneer in allowing agents to effortlessly multitask across various communication channels, providing a consistent and integrated experience for customers, yet under a managed environment which may be tailored for a busy or a quiet day,” says Elad Sananes, Head of Voca CIC Product Management at AudioCodes.\n\n“We're confident in this new offering to further equip our enterprise customers with the modern CX capabilities they look for, in order to thrive in the ever-demanding contact center space and departments beyond it.”\n\nThe new addition of omnichannel to Voca CIC further empowers AudioCodes Live, offering complete calling and contact center for Microsoft Teams. As of today, AudioCodes is the only managed service provider to deliver Microsoft Teams Phone enablement in combination with a native contact center solution — backed by the most extensive Microsoft-certified portfolio of products and services in the industry.\n\nVoca CIC is available as a 30-day free trial on the [AudioCodes website](/solutions-products/voiceai/voca-conversational-interaction-center \"Use Voca as a One-Screen Microsoft Teams Contact Center Built in Azure\"), as a native app on the [Microsoft Teams Store](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/99085833-810a-4b1f-a0c4-7c21f57bf2d8?source=app-details-dialog \"Microsoft Teams Store\") or [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/audiocodes.voca_teams_app?tab=Overview \"Microsoft AppSource\"). Interested customers can build a conversational contact center flow in 5 minutes, along with a free phone number from AudioCodes for immediate evaluation.\n\n[ ![](/css/images/ico-msg@2x.png) Get in touch ](#modalContact)\n\n×\n\nSales Inquiry Support Inquiry\n"

Slides](/media/ak5fdvyx/audiocodes-4q-2023-earnings-call-supplementary-slides.pdf)\n\n## Details\n\n**Lod, Israel – February 6, 2024 – AudioCodes (NASDAQ: AUDC) Press Release**\n\nAudioCodes (NASDAQ: AUDC), a leading vendor of advanced communications software, products and productivity solutions for the digital workplace, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year period ended December 31, 2023.\n\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $63.6 million compared to $61.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Revenues were $244.4 million in 2023 compared to $275.1 million in 2022.\n\nNet income was $3.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $4.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Net income was $8.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in 2023 compared to $28.5 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in 2022.\n\nOn a Non-GAAP basis, net income was $8.9 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $8.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was $25.0 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in 2023 compared to $45 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in 2022.\n\nNon-GAAP net income excludes: (i) share-based compensation expenses; (ii) amortization expenses related to intangible assets; (iii) expenses related to deferred payments in connection with the acquisition of Callverso Ltd; (iv) other income related to a payment made by the landlord to AudioCodes Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, in connection with the termination of a lease agreement for its offices in New Jersey; (v) financial income related to exchange rate differences in connection with revaluation of assets and liabilities in non-dollar denominated currencies; (vi) non-cash deferred tax expenses (income); and (vii) non-cash lease expense which is required to be recorded during the quarter even though this is a free rent period under the lease for the Company’s new headquarters. A reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis is provided in the tables that accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this press release.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $14.9 million for 2023.\n\nCash and cash equivalents, long and short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long and short-term financial investments were $106.7 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to $124.3 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, long and short-term bank deposits, long and short-term marketable securities and long and short-term financial investments was the result of the use of cash for the continued repurchasing of the Company’s ordinary shares pursuant to its share repurchase program and the payment of a cash dividend during each of the first and third quarters of 2023.\n\n“I am pleased to report solid fourth quarter 2023 results with strength across the strategic areas of our business,” said Shabtai Adlersberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of AudioCodes.\n\nWe continued to perform well in the enterprise space with business reaching roughly 90% for the fourth quarter and the full year. Microsoft-related business in the quarter grew 5% year-over-year, within which Teams grew 10% year-over-year. Full year Microsoft increased 7% year over year while Teams related business grew 13% year over year. We experienced continued strong momentum of our AudioCodes Live managed services, with ARR growing 50% year-over-year ending the quarter at $48 million, consistent with our expectations.\n\nImportantly, our customer experience (CX) and conversational AI (CAI) operations have clearly emerged as a second major growth pillar in our business. CX growth accelerated in the fourth quarter to over 40% year-over -year and to 19% for the full year. Conversational AI bookings grew over 50% for the quarter and the full year. Leading the growth in the CX and CAI markets has been Voca CIC, our Azure-native CCaaS solution for the Teams ecosystem, having won two large opportunities in North America. We have also seen solid growth with Meeting Insights, our enterprise grade solution for the meeting space.\n\nOn the operations side, I am glad to report solid progress in non-GAAP gross margin, which has recovered from early 2023 to reach 67.6%. Coupled with disciplined expense management, non-GAAP operating margin reached 16.9% in the quarter. With continued focus on shifting our business model into subscription and recurring sales, and the shift to higher margin cloud software solutions, we are making significant progress in our transformation to becoming a software and services company. With increased focus and investments in technologies and services for the UCaaS, CX and Conversational AI markets backed by strong Live bookings mainly in Teams, Live CX, and Voca CIC, we believe we are on the right path to execute on our plan to achieve revenue growth and drive improved profitability in 2024,” concluded Mr. Adlersberg.\n\n### Share Buy Back Program\n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company acquired 595,583 of its ordinary shares under its share repurchase program for a total consideration of $6.3 million.\n\nIn December 2023, the Company received court approval in Israel to purchase up to an aggregate amount of $20 million of additional ordinary shares. The court approval also permits AudioCodes to declare a dividend out of any part of this amount. The approval is valid through June 18, 2024.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $19.2 million available under the approval for the repurchase of shares and/or declaration of cash dividends.\n\n### Cash Dividend\n\nAudioCodes also announced today that the Company’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend in the amount of 18 cents per share. The aggregate amount of the dividend is approximately $5.5 million. The dividend is payable on March 6, 2024, to all of the Company’s shareholders of record at the close of trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 20, 2024.\n\nIn accordance with Israeli tax law, the dividend is subject to withholding tax at source at the rate of 25% of the dividend amount payable to each shareholder of record, subject to applicable exemptions. If the recipient of the dividend is at the time of distribution or was at any time during the preceding 12-month period the holder of 10% or more of the Company's share capital, the withholding rate is 30%.\n\nThe dividend will be paid in U.S. dollars on the ordinary shares of AudioCodes Ltd. that are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange. The amount and timing of any other dividends will be determined by the Board.\n\n### Conference Call & Web Cast Information\n\nAudioCodes will conduct a conference call at 8:30 A.M., Eastern Time today to discuss the Company's fourth quarter and full year of 2023 operating performance, financial results and outlook.

REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNot applicable.\nD. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Many of the risks summarized and then discussed in greater detail below\nrelate principally to our business, strategy and the industry in which we operate. Other risks relate principally to financial and economic\nconcerns, our operations in Israel, legal, regulatory and tax considerations and ownership of our ordinary shares. We believe that the\noccurrence of any one, or some combination, of the following factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, cash flows and results of operations.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of some of the principal risks we face. The list below is not exhaustive and, therefore, investors\nshould read this “Risk Factors” section in its entirety:\n• Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures and potential recessionary conditions, as well as\nactions taken by central banks and regulators across the world in an attempt to reduce, curtail and address such\npressures and conditions;\n• Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect these fluctuations to continue, any actual\nor anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations could require that we issue revised guidance, and the failure to\nmeet the expectations of our investors or analysts could have a material and adverse impact on our share price;\n• Our business will be harmed if Microsoft or our other contact center, unified communications and ALL-IP project\npartners abandon or fail to achieve the expected growth of solutions compatible with our products or if we are unable\nor unwilling to change our products when and as may be required in order to remain a certified partner;\n• If our new products fail to generate anticipated demand, we will realize a lower-than-expected return from our\ninvestment in research and development;\n• Rapid technological development in the communications equipment market necessitates that we effectively manage\ntransition to the next generation of our products;\n• The ongoing transition to the use of cloud-based software creates challenges for us because some of our products are\nintended for on-premises use;\n• The increased adoption of IP networks may adversely affect the demand for media gateway products;\n• Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot keep pace with technological changes\nimpacting the development of our products and implementation of our business needs, including with respect to\nautomation and the use of artificial intelligence, or AI;\n• New industry standards, the modification of our products to meet additional existing standards or the addition of\nfeatures to our products may delay the introduction of our products or increase our costs;\n• Because we sell most of our products and services to customers who function as intermediaries, such as original\nequipment manufacturers, or OEMs, network equipment providers, or NEPs, system integrators, carriers/service\nproviders, resellers and distributors, rather than directly to end-users, we are heavily reliant on such intermediaries\nand have less control over the ultimate selection of products by end-users;\n• The markets we serve are highly competitive and several of our competitors have competitive advantages over us,\nwhich may make it difficult for us to maintain profitability;\n• We rely on (i) third-party subcontractors to assemble, and original design manufacturers, or ODMs, to design and\nmanufacture, some of our products, and (ii) third-party suppliers to provide us with key components on a timely basis;\n• We may need additional financing to operate or grow our business;\n- 2 -\n• Uncertain economic conditions, macroeconomic changes and trade wars (such as the trade war between the U.S. and\nChina) may adversely affect our business;\n• The attack on Israel in October 2023 and the ensuing war with the Hamas terror organization, along with related\nconflicts with their supporters in Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization), Yemen (with the Houthi\nmovement), Syria and Iran, have led to an emergency call up of reserve army soldiers and caused disruption and\nuncertainty in Israel, including in terms of personal safety, damage to property, economic outlook, geopolitical\ntensions, the war effort and toll more generally;\n• Political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations and we are subject to specific risks,\nsuch as (i) fluctuations in the value of the dollar against the NIS, and (ii) labor disputes and strikes;\n• We are subject to ongoing costs and risks associated with complying with rapidly changing laws and regulations in\nmultiple jurisdictions, including with respect to protection of our intellectual property, privacy, AI, the use of\nenvironmentally friendly materials in our products, electronic equipment waste disposal and encryption technology;\n• We have a significant presence in international markets and plan to continue to expand our international operations,\nwhich exposes us to a number of risks that could affect our future growth;\n• There are significant shortages of critical components that we utilize and therefore, we may not be able to manufacture\nsufficient quantities to keep up with market demand; and\n• Our wage-related expenses in Israel have increased exponentially as a result of the ongoing shortage of skilled research\nand development, or R&D, employees in Israel, which is causing heightened competition to recruit new employees.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Strategy and Industry\nThe attack on Israel in October 2023, and the ensuing war with the Hamas terror organization and related conflicts with their\nsupporters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nOn October 7, 2023, terrorists from Hamas and other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza\nStrip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets, including widespread killings and kidnappings. Shortly following\nthe attack, Israel declared war against Hamas. In addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued hostilities\nalong Israel’s northern border with Hamas supporters, including Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization) and Syria. The\naggressors have utilized, and could continue to use, terror, rocket and drone attacks, which target locations throughout Israel and cause\nsubstantial disruption and damage. Israel may not be able to defend effectively against such attacks and such attacks could have a\nmaterial and adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition. Additionally, the Houthi movement, which controls\nparts of Yemen, launched a number of rocket attacks targeting Israel’s southern border and attacks on marine vessels traversing the Red\nSea, which marine vessels were thought to either be in route towards Israel or to be partly owned by Israeli businessmen. It is possible\nthat these hostilities will escalate, and that other terrorist organizations, including the Palestinian military organizations in the West\nBank as well as other hostile countries, such as Iran, will join the hostilities.\nTo date, none of our facilities or infrastructure have been damaged nor have our supply chains been significantly impacted\nsince the war commenced in October 2023. However, we cannot predict the ultimate effect that the ongoing war and hostilities will have\non us, including our supply chain and our ability to ship products from Israel, and any increase in these hostilities or any future armed\nconflict, political instability or violence in the region. Additionally, some of our officers and employees in Israel are obligated to perform\nannual military reserve duty and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances. For example, in\nconnection with the war with Hamas and conflicts with its supporters described above, some of our employees were called up to serve\nin the army. Some of our employees live within conflict area territories and may be forced to stay at home instead of reporting to work.\nIf many of our employees are called for active duty, or forced to stay at home, our operations in Israel and our business may be materially\nand adversely affected.\n- 3 -\nA number of countries and organizations continue to restrict or ban business with Israel or Israeli companies, or companies\ndoing business with Israel or Israeli companies, which may limit our ability to make sales in those countries. The war with Hamas and\nconflicts with its supporters have also led to a reduction in the number of airlines and flights to Israel as well as a threat to shipping\nlines. In addition, there have been increased efforts by activists to cause companies and consumers to boycott Israeli goods based on\nIsraeli government policies. Such actions, particularly if they become more widespread, may adversely impact our ability to sell our\nproducts. Moreover, any deterioration in the capital markets resulting directly or indirectly from the ongoing conflict could limit our\nability to obtain external financing.\nWe cannot predict the full impact of the war with Hamas and the related conditions on us in the future, particularly if emergency\ncircumstances or geopolitical tensions continue, any aspect of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\nposition, operating results and cash flows. To the extent that the ongoing war with Hamas and conflicts with its supporters materially\nand adversely affects our business and financial results, such may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described\nin this Item 3.D, “Risk Factors.”\nEpidemics, pandemics, global health crises, or other public health events, threats and concerns, including, but not limited to,\nany resurgence of COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and cash\nflows.\nEpidemics, pandemics, global health crises, or other public health events, threats and concerns, including, but not limited to,\nthe global spread of COVID-19, Ebola, the H1N1 flu virus, the Zika virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and other highly\ncommunicable diseases, outbreaks of which have occurred fairly recently in various parts of the world in which we operate, could\nadversely impact our operations, the operations of our clients and the global economy, including the level of demand for our services.\nIn particular, a resurgence of COVID-19, including its highly contagious variants and sub-lineages, could present significant\nand additional challenges and risks to businesses around the world. Governmental authorities of many countries, including Israel and\nthe United States, previously implemented, and could elect to re-implement, significant measures to control any resurgence of COVID-\n19, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material limitations\non the conduct of businesses.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we previously implemented remote working and workplace protocols for our\nemployees in Israel in accordance with Israeli Ministry of Health requirements and similar arrangements in other countries in which we\noperate. Similarly, to ensure business continuity, other companies and contact centers were compelled to transition their employees\nquickly from a physical office to a Work from Home, or WFH environment. This in turn led to increased demand for UCaaS (UC as a\nService) and video conferencing solutions, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, as well as WFH agent solutions for contact centers. As\na result of these recent trends, we have experienced an increased demand for our related products and solutions.\nIn response to such increased demand, we previously launched WFH promotions and solutions aimed at helping companies\noffer reliable and high-quality voice communications for WFH employees and contact center agents. Businesses that previously were\nunable to transition to WFH, or faced challenges in their implementation of WFH arrangements due to aging or inappropriate\ncommunications solutions, have begun, and will likely continue, to adopt policies and technologies to better prepare them for future\nforeseeable and unforeseeable events that prevent employees from working in a physical on-site office, a trend which has provided a\ndirect benefit to our business. While we believe that more businesses may ultimately decide to transition to WFH, either fully or partially,\nas a continuing alternative to the manner in which they conducted their operations before the COVID-19 pandemic, any material\ndecreases to the use of WFH could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nThe resurgence or discovery of any new strains of COVID-19, the development, availability and effectiveness of treatments or\nvaccines for COVID-19 or any other global health crisis could materially impact our business and operations. Therefore, we can give\nno assurances that any resurgence of COVID-19 or any other global health crisis will not have a material adverse effect on our financial\nposition or results of operations in 2024 and beyond.\nTo the extent a resurgence of COVID-19 or any other global health crisis adversely affects our business and financial results,\nit may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those relating to our\nability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness or our ability to access additional capital\nshould the need arise.\n- 4 -\nWe have invested significant resources in developing products compatible with Microsoft Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams\nand related solutions of our other partners. If Microsoft or our other contact center, unified communications and ALL-IP project\npartners, such as Genesys, Zoom, Avaya or the BroadSoft division of Cisco, abandon their solutions compatible with our\nproducts, decide to promote products of our competitors instead of our own products (including as a result of acquiring one of\nour competitors), become unwilling to continue to recognize AudioCodes as a partner or fail to achieve the expected growth of\nsolutions compatible with our products, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe have invested significant resources in complying with Microsoft’s requirements for the purpose of becoming a Microsoft recognized\npartner for their unified communication solutions for the enterprise market, which are known as Microsoft Skype for Business (formerly\nknown as Microsoft Lync) and Microsoft Teams. We have adapted some of our gateway products, IP phones, session border controllers,\nsurvivable branch applications, value added applications and professional services to operate in the Skype for Business and Teams\nenvironments. We believe that recognition as a Microsoft partner and having our products certified by Microsoft, when such a\ncertification program exists, enhances our access to and visibility in markets relevant to our products. We depend on users of Skype for\nBusiness and Teams selecting our compatible products and purchasing them. If Microsoft abandons or significantly changes Skype for\nBusiness and Teams, decides to promote our competitors’ products instead of ours (including as a result of an acquisition of one of our\ncompetitors), becomes unwilling to continue to recognize AudioCodes as a Skype for Business and Teams partner or fails to achieve\nthe expected growth of Skype for Business or Teams, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nSimilarly, we have invested in the development of products and capabilities and achieving certifications for the solutions of other\npartners of ours, such as Genesys and Avaya contact centers, Zoom phone or BroadSoft’s BroadWorks and BroadCloud (acquired by\nCisco). If those partners decide to promote products of our competitors instead of our products, are unwilling to continue to recognize\nAudioCodes as a partner or fail to achieve the expected growth of solutions compatible with our products, our results of operations may\nbe adversely affected.\nIf new products we introduce or expect to introduce in the future fail to generate the level of demand we anticipated, we will\nrealize a lower-than-expected return from our investment in research and development with respect to those products, and our\nresults of operations may suffer.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on the willingness of our customers to transition or migrate to new products, such as our (i) expanded\noffering of cloud session border controller products, (ii) multi-service business routers, or MSBRs, (iii) IP phones and meeting room\nsolutions, (iv) management, (v) analytics and Voice.AI software solutions and value-added application products, (vi) services or (vii)\nexpected future products. We continually evaluate and assess changing market demands and customer requirements in order to develop\nand introduce new products, features and applications to meet changing demands and requirements. We need to interpret market trends\nand the advancement of technology in order to successfully develop and introduce new products, features and applications. If potential\ncustomers defer transition or migration to new products, our return on our investment in research and development with respect to\nproducts recently introduced or expected to be introduced in the near future will be lower than we originally anticipated, and our results\nof operations may suffer.\nBecause of the rapid technological development in the communications equipment market and the intense competition we face,\nour products can become outmoded or obsolete in a relatively short period of time, which requires us to provide frequent updates\nand/or replacements to existing products. If we do not successfully manage the transition process to the next generation of our\nproducts, our operating results may be harmed.\nThe communications equipment market is characterized by rapid technological innovation and intense competition. Accordingly, our\nsuccess depends in part on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop next generation products and product features in a\ntimely and cost-effective manner. The development of new products is expensive, complex and time-consuming. If we do not rapidly\ndevelop our next generation products ahead of our competitors and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, we\nmay lose both existing and potential customers to our competitors. Further, if a competitor develops a new, less expensive product using\na different technological approach to delivering informational services over existing networks, our products would no longer be\ncompetitive. Conversely, even if we are successful in rapidly developing new products ahead of our competitors, if we do not cost-\neffectively manage our inventory levels of existing products when making the transition to new products, our financial results could be\nnegatively affected by write-offs as a result of high levels of obsolete inventory. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our operating\nresults would be harmed.\n- 5 -\nThe increased adoption of IP networks may adversely affect the demand for media gateway products.\nMedia gateway products are primarily intended to transmit voice from traditional telephony networks to IP networks and vice versa.\nAlong with the growth and adoption of IP networks, there has been an increase in the amount of information that is sent directly from\none IP network to another IP network. This direct network communication potentially obviates the need to use a media gateway. A\nreduction in the demand for media gateways may adversely affect the demand for our media gateway products and, in turn, adversely\naffect our results of operations. This transition is ongoing and has resulted in a decline in our revenues from such products. Various\nregulators and service providers have announced planned deadlines for transition to all-IP networks. While this transition could result\nin new sales opportunities, we believe the overall trend is a decline in revenues in the media gateway business.\nThe ongoing transition to the use of cloud-based software creates challenges for us.\nRecently, our partners have started adopting cloud-based architecture or cloud-based software as a service, or SaaS, models. For\nexample, Microsoft offers a cloud-based alternative to Skype for Business and Teams and has encouraged business customers to use\nthat model instead of an on-premise alternative. Moreover, the successor for Skype for Business is Teams, which by definition is cloud-\nbased only. Many of our products are intended for on-premise use with cloud architecture, but in some scenarios, cloud architecture\nintroduces an alternative to on-premise use. Currently, our revenue is generated primarily from on-premise deployments. The transition\nto cloud-based delivery impacts the architecture and role of our products in the overall solution. We may not succeed in transitioning in\ntime or at all to the new cloud-based technologies, products, solutions and services adopted by our partners and their customers. We\nmay not succeed in aligning our solutions with our partners’ solutions and be unable to bring sufficient value to them or their end\ncustomers. Our inability to adapt to the ongoing transition to the use of cloud-based software could have an adverse effect on us.\nFurthermore, SaaS pay-per-use licensing models may have an adverse effect on our short-term revenue recognition.\nNew industry standards, the modification of our products to meet additional existing standards or the addition of features to\nour products may delay the introduction of our products or increase our costs.\nThe industry standards that apply to our products are continually evolving. In addition, since our products are integrated into\nnetworks consisting of elements manufactured by various companies, they must comply with a number of industry standards and\npractices established by various international bodies and industry forums. Should new standards gain broad acceptance, we will be\nrequired to adopt those standards in our products. We may also decide to modify our products to meet additional existing standards or\nadd features to our products. Standards may be adopted by various industry interest groups or may be proprietary and nonetheless\naccepted broadly in the industry. It may take us a significant amount of time to develop and design products incorporating these new\nstandards.\nOur OEM customers, potential customers or partners may develop or prefer to develop their own technical solutions, use their\nown internal resources as an alternative to our technical services, or purchase third-party technology or services as an\nalternative to our technical services, and as a result, may not buy our products.\nWe sell our products as components or building blocks to some potential customers, such as large OEMs, NEPs, enterprises and carriers.\nThese customers incorporate our products into their product offerings, usually in conjunction with value-added services of their own or\nof third parties. These potential customers may prefer to develop their own technology or purchase third-party technology. They could\nalso manufacture their own components or building blocks that are similar to the ones we offer. Large customers have already committed\nsignificant resources in developing integrated product offerings. Customers may decide that this gives them better profitability and/or\ngreater control over supplies, specifications and performance. Customers may therefore not buy components or products from an external\nmanufacturer such as us. This could have an adverse impact on our ability to sell our products and, as a result, may reduce our revenues.\n- 6 -\nWe generally sell to OEMs, NEPs, system integrators, carriers/service providers and distributors who function as intermediaries\nbetween us as an equipment supplier and the ultimate end-users of our products. As a result, we have less information with\nrespect to the actual requirements of end-users and their utilization of equipment. We also have less influence over the choice of\nequipment by these end-users.\nGenerally, our customers are OEMs, NEPs, system integrators, carriers/service providers and distributors, rather than the end-users of\nequipment that we supply. These customers usually purchase equipment from several suppliers and may be trying to fulfill their end-\nuser customers’ specific technical specifications. We rely heavily on these customers for sales of our products and to inform us about\nmarket trends and the needs of their end-user customers. We cannot be certain that this information is accurate. If the information we\nreceive is not accurate, we may be manufacturing products for which no customer demand exists or fail to manufacture products that\nend-users want. Because we sell most of our products to customers who function as intermediaries rather than directly to end-users, we\nare heavily reliant on such intermediaries and have less control over the ultimate selection of products by end-users.\nThe markets we serve are highly competitive and several of our competitors have competitive advantages over us, which may\nmake it difficult for us to maintain profitability.\nCompetition in our industry is intense and we expect competition to increase in the future. Our competitors currently sell\nproducts that provide similar benefits to those that we sell. There has been a significant amount of merger and acquisition\nactivity, frequently involving major telecommunications equipment manufacturers acquiring smaller companies, as well as\nstrategic alliances entered into by competitors. We expect that these activities will result in an increasing concentration of market\nshare among these companies, many of whom are our customers.\nOur competitors in the area of enterprise session border controllers include, among others, Oracle, Ribbon Communications, Metaswitch\n(acquired by Microsoft Azure for Operators), TE-Systems and Ingate.\nOur competitors in the area of low and mid-density digital gateways include, among others, Ribbon Communications, Cisco, Dialogic,\nNewRock, Patton, Ferrari and Sangoma.\nOur competitors in the area of multi-service business routers include, among others, Cisco, Juniper, Adtran, One-Access (acquired by\nEkinops), Patton, Huawei, HP/3COM and Alcatel-Lucent.\nOur competitors in the area of call recording, Compliance recording and Convenient include, among others, Verint, NICE, ACS, Red\nBox (acquired by Uniphore), Teleware and Dubber.\nOur competitors in the area of applications leveraging speech recognition and conversational AI technology include, among others,\nTwilio, Nuance (acquired by Microsoft) and IBM, as well as Contact Center vendors (including Genesys, NICE and Five9s). Some\npublic cloud providers offer technology and services that partially overlap with ours and several smaller start-up companies are also\ndeveloping competing solutions.\nOur competitors in the area of Conversational IVR and Speech Attendants include companies such as Nuance, Parlance, and other\ncontact center vendors IVR solutions.\nOur competitors in the area of contact center include, but are not limited to, Anywhere365, Luware, Landis, ComputerTalk and\nother contact center vendors, primarily focused on the Microsoft Teams product.\nOur competitors in the area of SmartTAP360 live which focuses mainly on compliance and quality recording in conjunction with\nMicrosoft Teams are listed in the certified list of Microsoft vendors although we mainly see in the mid-market projects ASC, Red Box\n(acquired by Uniphore), NICE, Dybber, CallCabinet and Verint.\nOur competitors in the area of Meeting Insights, which is focused on productivity enhancement, organization repository and sharing for\nmeetings in the Microsoft Teams environment, include, but are not limited to, Avoma, Otter and Fireflies.AI.\nOur principal competitors in the area of IP phones and meeting room devices are device-focused vendors that also certified on MSFT\nor ZOOM. These competitors include Poly (acquired by HP Inc.), Yealink, Logitech, Crestron and many others.\n- 7 -\nOur competitors for AudioCodes Live for Microsoft Teams are companies that offer a variety managed services for business customers.\nThese companies include systems integrators, service providers and some cloud-based solution providers. In certain cases, some\ncompanies buy AudioCodes products and/or services, and use them to offer managed services to their customers. AudioCodes sometimes\nworks in partnership with such companies to complement their offering or even leverage some of their capabilities to offer managed\nservices.\nOur main competitor in the area of Live is the in-house implementation of projects (after buying products either directly or\nthrough an integrator). Competition is also in the form of system integrators such as Converge One in USA, NTT or BT and\nnumerous others in various sizes and locations and specialties.\nSome of our competitors have the ability to offer vendor-sponsored financing programs to customers. Those with broad product\nportfolios may also be able to offer lower prices on products that compete with ours because of their ability to recoup a loss of margin\nthrough sales of other products or services. Additionally, voice, audio and other communications alternatives that compete with our\nproducts are constantly being introduced.\nOur competitors in Content delivery and connectivity platform, as well as Operator Connect Accelerate, Zoom exchange providers and\nWebEx enablement, are SIPIO, DSTNY Group and Nuwave. Some of our competitors are also customers of our products and\ntechnologies.\nIn the future, we may also develop and introduce other products or services with new or additional telecommunications capabilities or\nservices. As a result, we may compete directly with voice over-IP, or VoIP, companies, system integrators, value-added resellers, or\nVARs, and other telecommunications infrastructure and solution providers, some of which may be our current customers. Additional\ncompetitors may include companies that currently provide communication software products and services. The ability of some of our\ncompetitors to bundle other enhanced services or complete solutions with VoIP products could give these competitors an advantage\nover us.\nOffering to sell directly to carriers or service providers may expose us to requirements for service which we may not be able to\nmeet.\nWe also sell our products directly to telecommunications carriers, service providers or other end-users. We have traditionally\nrelied on third-party distributors and OEMs to test and/or sell our products and to inform us about the requirements of end-users.\nTelecommunications carriers and other service providers have great bargaining power in negotiating contracts. Generally, contracts with\nend-users tend to be more complex and impose more obligations on us than contracts with third-party distributors. We may be unable\nto meet the requirements of these contracts. If we are unable to meet the conditions of a contract with an end-user customer, we may be\nrequired to pay liquidated damages or become subject to liabilities that could result in a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nSelling directly to end-users and VARs may adversely affect our relationship with our current third-party distributors upon\nwhom we expect to continue to rely for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of third-party distributors and OEMs, or a decreased\ncommitment by them to sell our products as a result of direct sales by us, could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors to assemble and ODMs to design and manufacture some of our products, and therefore\ndo not directly control manufacturing costs, product delivery schedules or manufacturing quality.\nOur products are assembled and tested by third-party subcontractors. As a result of our reliance on third-party subcontractors,\nwe cannot directly control product delivery schedules. We have in the past experienced delays in delivery schedules. Any problems that\noccur and persist in connection with the delivery, quality or cost of the assembly and testing of our products could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This reliance could also lead to product shortages or quality\nassurance problems, which, in turn, could lead to an increase in the costs of manufacturing or assembling our products.\n- 8 -\nIn addition, we have engaged several ODMs based in Asia to design and manufacture some of our products and may engage\nadditional ODMs in the future. Any problems that occur and persist in connection with the delivery, quality, cost of the assembly or\ntesting of our products, as well as the termination of our commercial relationship with an ODM or the discontinuance of the\nmanufacturing of the respective products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf a small number of third-party suppliers do not provide us with key components on a timely basis, we may not be able to\ndeliver our products to our customers, and substantial reengineering costs may be incurred.\nTexas Instruments Incorporated, DSPG and Rockchip, collectively, supply all of the chips for our signal processor product line.\nOur signal processor line is used both as a product line in its own right and as a key component in our other product lines. Motorola and\nCavium Networks manufacture all of the communications and network processors currently used in our embedded communications\nboards and network products.\nWe have not entered into any long-term supply agreements or alternate source agreements with our suppliers and, while we\nmaintain an inventory of critical components, our inventory of chips would likely not be sufficient in the event that we had to engage\nan alternate supplier for these components.\nAn unexpected termination of the supply of the chips provided by Texas Instruments, DSPG, Rockchip or the communications\nprocessors supplied by Motorola or Cavium Networks or disruption in their timely delivery would require us to make a large investment\nin capital and personnel to shift to using chips or signal processors manufactured by other companies and may cause a delay in\nintroducing replacement products. Customers may not accept an alternative product design. Supporting old products or redesigning\nproducts may make it more difficult for us to support our products.\nWe depend on other sole source suppliers to produce components for us without the benefit of long-term supply agreements or\nalternative source agreements.\nSome of our sole source suppliers custom produce components for us based upon our specifications and designs while other of\nour sole source suppliers are the only manufacturers of certain components required by our products. We have not entered into any long-\nterm supply agreements or alternative source agreements with our suppliers and while we maintain an inventory of components from\nsingle source providers, our inventory would likely not be sufficient in the event that we had to engage an alternate supplier of these\nsingle source components. In the event of any interruption in the supply of components from any of our sole source suppliers, we may\nhave to expend significant time, effort and other resources in order to locate a suitable alternative manufacturer and secure replacement\ncomponents. If no replacement components are available, we may be forced to redesign certain of our products. Any such new design\nmay not be accepted by our customers. A prolonged disruption in supply may force us to redesign and retest our products. Any\ninterruption in supply from any of these sources or an unexpected technical failure or termination of the manufacture of components\ncould disrupt production, thereby adversely affecting our ability to deliver products and to support products previously sold to our\ncustomers.\nIn addition, if demand for telecommunications equipment increases, we may face a shortage of components from our suppliers.\nThis could result in longer lead times, increases in the price of components and a reduction in our margins, all of which could adversely\naffect the results of our operations.\nWe have depended, and expect to continue to depend, on a small number of large customers. The loss of one of our large\ncustomers or the reduction in purchases by a significant customer or failure of such customer to pay for the products it purchases\nfrom us could have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, sales to Westcon Group, our largest customer in 2023, accounted for approximately 16.3%, 15.1%\nand 15.4%, respectively, of our total revenues, and sales to ScanSource Communications Group accounted for approximately 10.3%,\n10.0% and 10.9%, respectively, of our total revenues. Both ScanSource and Westcon act as distributors or perform order fulfillment for\nsmaller orders from other customers and do not purchase products for internal use. If we lose a large customer, or if purchases made by\nsuch customers are significantly reduced, or if a large customer fails to pay for the products it purchases from us, our revenues and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\n- 9 -\nOur products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods, which increase our costs in obtaining orders and\nreduce the predictability of our revenues.\nOur products are technologically complex and are typically intended for use in applications that may be critical to the business\nof our customers. Prospective customers generally must make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our products\nand to integrate them into larger systems. Many of our customers are large organizations with complex and lengthy evaluation, decision\nmaking and negotiation processes. As a result, our sales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes\nthat typically accompany the design and testing of new communications equipment. The sales cycles of our products to new customers\nare approximately six to twelve months after a design win, depending on the type of customer and complexity of the product. This time\nperiod may be further extended because of internal testing, field trials and requests for the addition or customization of features or\nacceptance testing. This delays the time until we realize revenue and results in significant investment of resources in attempting to make\nsales.\nLong sales cycles also subject us to risks not usually encountered in a short sales span, including customers’ budgetary\nconstraints, internal acceptance reviews and cancellation. In addition, orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of\nthe timing of customers’ procurement decisions. The time required to implement our products can vary significantly with the needs of\nour customers and generally exceeds several months; larger implementations can take multiple calendar quarters. This complicates our\nplanning processes and reduces the predictability of our revenues.\nOur independent sales representatives may fail to market our products effectively.\nA significant portion of our marketing and sales involves the aid of independent sales representatives that are not under our\ndirect control. We cannot be certain that our current independent sales representatives will continue to distribute our products or that,\neven if they continue to distribute our products, they will do so successfully. These representatives are not subject to any minimum\npurchase requirements and can discontinue marketing our products at any time. In addition, these representatives often market products\nof our competitors. Accordingly, we must compete for the attention and sales efforts of our independent sales representatives.\nOur products could contain defects, which would reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us.\nWe develop complex and evolving products. Despite testing by us and our customers, undetected errors or defects may be\nfound in existing or new products. The introduction of products with reliability, quality or compatibility problems could result in reduced\nrevenues, additional costs, increased product returns and difficulty or delays in collecting accounts receivable. The risk is higher with\nproducts still in the development stage, where full testing or certification is not yet completed. This could result in, among other things,\na delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. We could also be subject to\nmaterial claims by customers that are not covered by our insurance.\nObtaining certification of our products by national regulators may be time-consuming and expensive. We may be unable to sell\nour products in markets in which we are unable to obtain certification.\nOur customers may expect us to obtain certificates of compliance with safety and technical standards set by national regulators,\nespecially standards set by U.S. or European regulators. There is no uniform set of standards, and each national regulator may impose\nand change its own standards. National regulators may also prohibit us from importing products that do not conform to their standards.\nIf we make any change in the design of a product, we are usually required to obtain recertification of the product. The process of\ncertification may be time-consuming and expensive and may affect the length of the sales cycle for a product. If we are unable to obtain\ncertification of a product in a market, we may be unable to sell the product in that market.\n- 10 -\nThe growth in our product portfolio means that we have to service and support more products. This may result in an increase\nin our expenses and an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe size of our product portfolio has increased and continues to increase. As a result, we are required to provide product support\nto our customers. Customers have requested that we provide a contractual commitment to support a product for a specified period of\ntime. This period of time may exceed the working life of the product or extend past the period of time that we may intend to manufacture\nor support a product. We are dependent on our suppliers for the components (hardware and software) needed to provide support and\nmay be unable to secure the components necessary to satisfy our service commitments. We do not have long-term contracts with our\nsuppliers, and they may not be obligated to provide us with products or services for any specified period of time. We may need to\npurchase an inventory of replacement components and parts in advance in order to try to provide for their availability when needed.\nThis could result in an increased risk of write-offs with respect to our replacement component inventory to the extent that we cannot\naccurately predict our future requirements under our customer service contracts. If any of our component suppliers cease production,\ncease operations or refuse or fail to make timely delivery of orders, we may not be able to meet our contractual commitments for product\nsupport. We may be required to supply enhanced components or parts as substitutes if the original versions are no longer available.\nProduct support may be costly and any extra service revenues may not cover the hardware and software costs associated with providing\nlong-term support.\nOur results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot keep pace with technological changes impacting\nthe development of our products and implementation of our business needs, including with respect to automation and the use of\nAI.\nWe use internally developed and third-party developed machine learning and AI technologies in our offerings and business,\nand we are making investments in expanding our AI-related capabilities in our products, services, and tools, including ongoing\ndeployment and improvement of existing machine learning and AI technologies. Over the last decade, AudioCodes has developed a\nrange of software-based voice productivity solutions through our Voice.AI business line. These include the Voca range of conversational\nAI-related solutions that incorporate voice recognition, AI and machine learning technologies, SmartTAP 360° Live, an intelligent,\nsecure enterprise compliance recording solution, Meeting Insights, an innovative tool for easily capturing and organizing all meeting-\ngenerated content and Voice.AI Connect a cloud-based solution that simplifies the integration of any cognitive voice service and bot\nframework with any voice or telephony channel to deliver an enhanced customer service experience.\nOur success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting the development of our products\nand implementation of our business needs. Emerging technological trends such as AI, machine learning and automation are impacting\nindustries and business operations. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately\nimplement new technologies or evolve our business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if we do not make\nthe right strategic investments to respond to these developments, our products, results of operations and ability to develop and maintain\nour business could be negatively affected. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI technologies into their services,\nproducts and business more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and materially\nand adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n- 11 -\nAs part of our go to market strategy, we have become certified solution partners of technological leaders such as Microsoft,\nGenesys and BroadSoft (acquired by Cisco). These companies change their go to market strategy and product mix and\ntechnology requirements often and do so on reasonably short notice. We may be unable or unwilling to change our products in\ntime and as may be required in order to remain a certified partner.\nIn recent years we have invested heavily in our product offerings that meet the requirements of the Microsoft Skype for Business\nand Microsoft Teams ecosystems. The nature of this Microsoft solution is undergoing major change and, as part of this change, we are\nwitnessing a shift from on-premises solutions to cloud-based or hybrid on-premises and cloud-based solutions. This directly impacts the\nsuitability of our products to end-users and impacts end-user demand for products in a changing technical environment. In 2018, Cisco\ncompleted the acquisition of BroadSoft. This acquisition has impacted BroadSoft’s directions and future developments, and, as a result,\nour investment in compatibility with the BroadSoft BroadWorks and BroadCloud solutions. These changes have affected, and may\ncontinue to affect, the revenues we derive from selling into BroadSoft/Cisco solutions. Genesys, a long-term partner of ours, is also in\nthe process of shifting from on-premises solutions to cloud-based or hybrid on-premises and cloud-based solutions, with potential impact\non the suitability and demand of our products in Genesys contact center deployments. We have little control and influence over the third\nparties with whom we engage, and therefore, any alterations or changes made by such third-party partners can negatively impact the\nresults of our operations on reasonably short notice. We may be unable to recover or adapt to such changes.\nGrowing emphasis by the investment community, regulators and other stakeholders on environmental, social and governance-\nrelated matters could impact our business and operations.\nAs members of the investment community have started to heavily factor in a company’s commitment to environmental, social\nand governance, or ESG related initiatives and sustainability performance as part of their overall investment thesis and strategy, such\ninvestors could elect to eventually forego their investment in us to the extent we fail to satisfy such metrics. Moreover, the increased\nfocus by investors, regulators and other stakeholders on ESG related practices and disclosures has created, and will likely create for the\nforeseeable future, increased pressure regarding the enhancement of, and modification to, our disclosure and governance practices.\nRecently, there has been a growing concern and emphasis by governmental agencies regarding the effects of climate change on the\nenvironment and the need to make disclosures to investors regarding a company’s environmental footprint. For example, on March 6,\n2024, the SEC adopted a final rule requiring public companies to include certain climate-related disclosures in their respective\nregistration statements and annual reports filed with the SEC, including climate-related financial statement metrics, greenhouse gas\nemissions and climate-related targets and goals, and management’s role in managing material climate-related risks. A number of state\nlegislators and regulators, including California laws S.B. 253, S.B. 261 and A.B. 1305 in the State of California, as well as non-U.S.\ngovernmental agencies (such as the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), have adopted or are currently considering\nproposing or adopting other rules, regulations, directives, initiatives and laws requiring ESG-related disclosures or limiting (or\naffirmatively requiring) certain ESG-related conduct. In the event that we were to become subject to any of the newly adopted climate\nchange and/or ESG-related disclosure regimes, including in the United States and elsewhere, it could require us to, among other things,\n(i) restrict or limit our operating activities or other conduct, (ii) make material capital improvements and expend material capital\nresources in connection with such compliance efforts, and (iii) alter our business and operational strategy more generally. Furthermore,\nthere continues to be a lack of consistent proposed climate change and ESG-related legislation, which creates regulatory and economic\nuncertainty. Separately, enhanced climate-related disclosure requirements and obligations could lead to reputational or other harm with\ncustomers, regulators, investors or other stakeholders and could also increase our litigation risks relating to statements alleged to have\nbeen made by us or others in our industry regarding climate change risks, or in connection with any future disclosures we may make\nregarding reported emissions, particularly given the inherent approximations, estimations and uncertainties with respect to calculating,\ndetermining and reporting greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, governmental regulators, including the SEC, have also from time to\ntime applied additional scrutiny to existing climate change-related assertions in public disclosures, increasing the potential for\nenforcement if any such governmental regulator were to allege that our climate change-related disclosures are misleading or deficient.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we currently face, and are likely to continue to face, increasing pressure regarding our ESG-related\ndisclosures, practices, initiatives and sustainability performance in the near- and long-term. We continue to monitor for these changes\nand their potential impact on our business, financial condition and industry at large, and seek to implement measures to comply with all\nsuch newly implemented requirements; however, given the rapidly changing nature of these rules, regulations, directives, initiatives and\nlaws, and the heightened regulatory scrutiny being applied by governmental agencies across numerous jurisdictions, it is not possible to\npredict how such matters will ultimately impact our business or that of our critical counterparties at this time.\n- 12 -\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nHigh rates of global inflation and the occurrence of a recession could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the global markets experienced, and continue to experience, higher rates of inflation as a result of\nseveral market factors, including in the form of increased costs pertaining to labor, materials, shipping and overhead. As a result of these\ninflationary pressures, governments in many countries implemented tighter monetary policies (including in the form of higher interest\nrates), which could slow the growth rate of local economies and restrict the availability of credit and financing. Interest rates may\nincrease further, or they may remain at current levels for the near-term, and this new interest rate environment could materially and\nadversely affect our business, the counterparties with which we interact and the global economy at large. We believe that our financial\ncondition and results of operations have thus far not been materially impacted by inflationary pressures; however, as a result of\ninflationary pressures, more organizations have sought to deploy technology on a “pay per use” subscription model, leveraging advances\nin cloud-based technologies (such as Unified Communications as a Service and Contact Center as a Service). To the extent the current\nrates of inflation and shifts in fiscal and monetary policy result in prolonged and slower growth or a recession, it could have a material\nand adverse effect on the demand for our products and services and, in the process, our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition as a whole, including with respect to general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue. Moreover, in the\nevent that a global recession were to occur, it could adversely impact the critical counterparties that we engage, including in the form of\na decrease in the products and services they seek to obtain from us. We continue to monitor our operations and will seek to take\nappropriate actions to mitigate the potential impact of heightened inflation on our business. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances\nthat we will be successful in doing so, if at all.\nMaterial and adverse developments impacting the financial services industry at large, including the occurrence of actual (or\nwidespread concerns regarding the potential occurrence of) defaults, illiquidity, operational failures and non-performance by\nfinancial institutions and critical counterparties, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nThe occurrence of actual (or widespread concerns regarding the potential occurrence of) illiquidity, operational failures,\ndefaults, non-performance or other material and adverse developments that impact financial institutions and transactional counterparties,\nor other entities within the financial services industry at large, have previously caused, and could continue to cause, market-wide liquidity\nissues, bank-runs and general contagion across the global financial industry. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, or\nSVB, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\nor the FDIC, was subsequently appointed as a receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were\neach placed into receivership. We did not maintain accounts with either bank.\nFurthermore, we and other parties with whom we conduct business and engage commercially may be unable to access critical\nfunds in deposit accounts or other accounts held with a closed or failing financial institution or pursuant to lending arrangements with\nsuch financial institutions. Accordingly, in such instance, our ability to pay our obligations, and any of our counterparties’ ability to pay\ntheir respective obligations, or enter into new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments, could be materially and adversely\naffected. Counterparties to SVB credit agreements and arrangements, and third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit, among\nothers, could experience direct and indirect impacts from financial institutions in the future and uncertainty remains over liquidity\nconcerns in the broader financial services industry. Any material and adverse effects from the foregoing could additionally impact the\nbroader capital markets and, in turn, our ability to access those markets.\n- 13 -\nOur customers may require us to produce products or systems to hold in inventory in order to meet their “just in time,” or short\nlead time, delivery requirements. If we are unable to sell this inventory on a timely basis, we could incur charges for excess and\nobsolete inventory which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customers expect us to maintain an inventory of products available for purchase off-the-shelf subsequent to the initial sales\ncycle for these products. This may require us to incur the costs of manufacturing inventory without having a purchase order in place for\nthe specific products. The VoIP industry is subject to rapid technological change and volatile customer demands, which result in a short\nproduct commercial life before a product becomes obsolete. If we are unable to sell products that are held in inventory, we will need to\nwrite-off all or a part of the inventory value of these products. Write-offs and obsolescence could materially and adversely affect our\noperating results and financial condition. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we wrote off inventory in the aggregate amount of\napproximately $1.1 million, during the year ended December 31, 2022, our inventory write off was immaterial, and during the year\nended December 31, 2021, we wrote off inventory in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.7 million. We have incurred, and are\nlikely to continue to incur in the near- and long-term, write-offs as a result of slow-moving items, excess inventories, discontinued\nproducts and products with net realizable value lower than cost.\nThe right of our customers to return products and their right to exchange products may affect our ability to recognize revenues,\nwhich could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSome of our customers expect us to permit them to return some or all of the products they purchase from us. If we contractually\nagree to allow a customer to return products, the customer may be entitled to a refund for the returned products or to receive credit for\nthe purchase of replacement products. If we agree to this type of contractual obligation, it could affect our ability to recognize revenues.\nIn addition, if we are not able to resell any products that are returned, we would have to write-off this inventory. This could adversely\naffect our results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing to operate or grow our business. We may not be able to raise additional financing for our\ncapital needs on favorable terms, or at all, which could limit our ability to expand and to continue our long-term expansion\nplans.\nWe may need additional financing to operate our business, continue our longer-term expansion plans or acquire other\nbusinesses. To the extent that we cannot fund our activities and acquisitions through our existing cash resources and any cash we generate\nfrom operations, we may need to raise equity or debt funds through additional public or private financing. We cannot be certain that we\nwill be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. This could inhibit our growth, increase our\nfinancing costs or cause us severe financial difficulties.\nWe have a limited order backlog and, therefore, if revenue levels for any quarter fall below our expectations, our results of\noperations will be adversely affected.\nWe have a limited order backlog, which makes revenues in any quarter substantially dependent on orders received and delivered\nin that quarter. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even from one customer, may have a significant negative impact on our results of\noperations for a given period. We base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends. Our expense levels\nare relatively fixed and require some time for adjustment. Because only a small portion of our expenses varies with our revenues, if\nrevenue levels fall below our expectations, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur gross margin could be negatively impacted by amortization expenses in connection with acquisitions, increased\nmanufacturing costs and other factors, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur gross margin has fluctuated and been negatively affected in the past, and could continue to be negatively affected, by\namortization expenses in connection with acquisitions, expenses related to share-based compensation, increases in manufacturing costs,\na shift in our sales mix towards our less profitable products and services, increased customer demand for longer product warranties,\nfixed expenses that are applied to a lower revenue base, exchange rate fluctuations and increased cost pressures as a result of increased\ncompetition. Acquisitions of new businesses could also negatively affect our gross margin. A decrease in our gross margin could cause\nan adverse effect on our results of operations.\n- 14 -\nUncertain economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nIn the past, uncertain global and local economic conditions have had a significant impact on the technology industry and our\nmajor customers and potential customers. Conditions may continue to be uncertain or may be subject to deterioration, which could lead\nto a reduction in consumer and customer spending overall and result in an adverse impact on sales of our products. A disruption in the\nability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses,\nwhich could lead to a significant reduction in their orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment\nobligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. A significant adverse\nchange in a customer’s financial and/or credit position could also require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer’s\nreceivables or could limit our ability to collect receivables related to previous purchases by that customer. As a result, our allowance for\ncredit losses and write-offs of accounts receivable could increase.\nThe ongoing trade war between China and the United States and its potential escalation may have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness operations and revenues.\nStarting in April 2018, the United States imposed a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports from other\ncountries. On July 6, 2018, the United States imposed 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. China instituted retaliatory\ntariffs on certain United States goods. In 2019, the United States and China implemented several rounds of tariff increases and\nretaliations. On January 15, 2020, the United States and China signed a Phase One trade deal pursuant to which, among other things,\nthe United States will modify existing tariffs. In October 2022, the Biden administration issued a new set of export controls which (i)\nbanned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment in the United States without a license, and (ii)\nrestricted the ability of U.S. persons from providing support for the development or production of chips at certain manufacturing facilities\nin China. Moreover, in December 2022, the United States imposed new duties on imports from certain major solar panel makers in\nChina after an investigation determined that such manufacturers were avoiding tariffs by finishing their products in Southeast Asian\ncountries. More recently, President Biden signed an executive order that will make it more difficult for U.S. firms to invest in certain\nChinese companies—citing national security concerns, the executive order prohibits investments in AI and quantum computing. In\nresponse to the foregoing, China implemented its own export controls on two rare elements, germanium and gallium, which the United\nStates relies on to produce chips, fiber optics and solar panels.\nSince we operate in the United States and deliver products and services to customers in the United States, the trade war could\nmaterially and adversely affect us, and especially if, when and to the extent escalated, may cause global economic turmoil and adversely\nimpact the supply chain for our products, the cost of our products and the demand for our products and, thus, may have a material\nadverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe prices of our products may become less competitive due to foreign exchange fluctuations.\nAlthough we have operations throughout the world, the majority of our revenues and our operating costs in 2023 were\ndenominated in, or linked to, the dollar. Accordingly, we consider the dollar to be our functional currency. However, a significant portion\nof our operating costs in 2023 (including our cost of revenues) were incurred in NIS. During 2023, the NIS depreciated against the\ndollar, which resulted in a decrease in the dollar costs of our operations in Israel. As a result of this differential, from time to time we\nmay experience increases in the costs of our operations outside the United States, as expressed in dollars. If there is a significant increase\nor fluctuation in our expenses, we may be required to increase the price of our products, which could make our products and services\nless competitive in the markets in which we operate. Currently, our international sales are denominated primarily in dollars. Therefore,\nany devaluation in the local currencies of our customers relative to the dollar could cause customers to decrease or cancel orders or\ndefault on payment.\nOur sales to European customers denominated in Euros are increasing. Sales denominated in Euros could make our revenues\nsubject to fluctuation in the Euro/dollar exchange rate. If the dollar appreciates against the Euro, we may be required to increase the\nprices of our products that are denominated in Euros. In 2023, the Euro depreciated against the dollar, which resulted in an increase in\nthe prices of our products that are denominated in Euros.\n- 15 -\nThe ongoing conflict in Ukraine, including the actual (or perceived threat of an) expansion or exacerbation of such conflict, and\nthe actions undertaken by western nations (and their allies) in response to Russia’s actions, has resulted, and could continue to\nresult in, significant impacts on the global markets for the foreseeable future.\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Russia and Ukraine continue to engage in active and\narmed conflict. Such conflict has resulted, and will likely continue to result in, significant destruction of Ukraine’s infrastructure and\nsubstantial casualties amongst military personnel and civilians. As a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the governments of several\nnations have implemented commercial and economic sanctions against Russia (as well as certain banks, companies, government\nofficials, and other individuals in Russia and Belarus). In addition to governmental entities, actors in the private sector, including, among\nothers, tech firms, consumer brands and major manufacturers, have stopped, or previously announced that they intend to stop, operations\nin Russia and cease their partnerships with Russian firms, and shippers, insurance companies and refiners have similarly indicated that\nthey will no longer purchase or ship crude oil from Russia.\nIn March 2022, Israel’s then Foreign Minister Mr. Yair Lapid indicated that Israel would not function as a route to bypass\nsanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other western countries, and Israeli banks have elected to sever relationships with\nsanctioned Russian banks. Israel has not, as of the date of this Annual Report, imposed explicit sanctions on Russia or Belarus; however,\nit has publicly rejected Russia’s annexation of the four occupied regions of Ukraine and voiced support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity. Moreover, Israeli companies that have ties to the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union could\nbe indirectly subject to the measures imposed by such nations.\nIn May 2023, in coordination with the G7, Australia, and other partners, the United States imposed new sanctions on Russia.\nAs part of these actions, the U.S. Department of State imposed sanctions on over 200 entities, individuals, vessels, and aircraft, as well\nas designated certain entities and individuals (i) across Russia’s defense and related materiel, technology, and metals and mining sectors\nand (ii) involved in expanding Russia’s future energy production and capacity.\nIn December 2023, President Biden signed an executive order which seeks to strengthen U.S. sanctions authorities against\nfinancial facilitators of Russia’s war efforts, and additionally provided authority to broaden U.S. import bans on certain Russian goods.\nLikewise, in February 2024, the United States’ Treasury Department, State Department and Department of Commerce, collectively,\nimposed an extensive set of new sanctions on Russia, which specifically target Russia’s financial sector and military-industrial\noperations. Such sanctions seek to restrict Russia’s energy industry and limit the evasion of sanctions outside the United States, including\nby encompassing 500 additional persons associated with the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict.\nWhile it is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate consequences and impact of the conflict in Ukraine, such conflict\ncould result in, among other things, significant regional instability and geopolitical shifts, and material and adverse effects on global\nmacroeconomic conditions, financial markets, exchange rates and supply chains. To the extent negotiations between Russia and Ukraine\nare ultimately unsuccessful, the conflict in Ukraine could have a lasting impact in the near- and long-term on the financial condition,\nbusiness and operations of our business (and the businesses of the counterparties with whom we engage), and the global economy at\nlarge.\n- 16 -\nMacroeconomic changes, including political disturbances, geopolitical instability, and trade wars, may adversely impact our\nbusiness and operations.\nChanges in regional and global politics are leading to changes in the globalization and harmonization trends that prevailed in\nrecent decades. Threats of trade barriers, customs and duties and other political considerations, including mass strikes, wars, escalating\nor outbreak of armed hostilities, including the ongoing Russo-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas conflict, and other crises, are causing\ninstability in the accepted world order and the stability of financial markets. This may impact both our ability to manufacture and sell\nour products and services which would affect our results of our operations and may also affect the price of our ordinary shares. Our\nbusiness and operations are subject to uncertain macroeconomic changes, any of which could result in suspended operations, business\ninterruptions, and impediments to our business. Moreover, we are subject to risks of hostilities, confiscation, deprivation of assets or\nmilitary action that may directly or indirectly impact our operations, assets or financial performance in the areas where we operate. Most\nrecently, for example, the conflict in Ukraine has resulted in, among other things, significant regional instability and geopolitical shifts,\nand material and adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions, financial markets, exchange rates and supply chains. Likewise,\nthe assaults launched by Hamas and its supporters against Israeli citizens, and the related Israeli military action taken in response, has\ncaused substantial regional instability and extreme volatility in the global markets at large. It is not possible at this time to predict or\ndetermine the ultimate consequences of the conflict in Ukraine, which could include, among other things, greater regional instability,\ngeopolitical shifts and other material and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates, supply chains and\nfinancial markets.\nTerrorist attacks, or the threat of such attacks, may negatively impact the global economy which may materially adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operation and may cause our share price to decline.\nFinancial, political, economic and other uncertainties following terrorist attacks, both domestically and throughout the world,\nmay negatively impact the global economy. As a result, many of our customers and potential customers have become much more\ncautious in setting their capital expenditure budgets, thereby restricting their telecommunications procurement. Uncertainties related to\nthe threat of terrorism have had a negative effect on global economy, causing businesses to continue slowing spending on\ntelecommunications products and services and further lengthen already long sales cycles. Any escalation of these threats or similar\nfuture events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers, distributors and suppliers, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nAny shortages in, or increased costs of, semiconductors (and other components) could adversely impact our business and\nfinancial condition, including in the form of reduced revenues and increased costs and expenses.\nSince the onset of COVID-19, the semiconductor industry has experienced, and continues to experience, significant shortages\nin capacity, which has resulted in the elongation of the lead time required to produce semiconductors. Given that semiconductors are a\nkey component in our business, the inability to receive sufficient amounts of semiconductors on an expedited basis could impact our\nability to deliver our products and services to third parties on a timely basis or could lead to an increase in the costs of inventory and\noverall purchase price of components. In the event that the capacity shortage in the semiconductor industry (and other components)\ncontinues for an extended period of time in the future, it could, among other things, have a material and adverse impact on (i) our\nmanufacturing capabilities, (ii) our customer relationships, (iii) demand for our products and services and (iv) revenue and results of\noperations more generally. In the event that the semiconductor shortage improves in the near-term, such industry is historically cyclical\nand is characterized by rapid and recurring changes in technology, price erosion, short product life cycles, fluctuations in supply and\ndemand, and product obsolescence. Therefore, another material shortage could occur in the future. In 2023, the United States sought to\ntighten export control rules designed to limit the flow of artificial intelligence semiconductors to China, and the Netherlands intended\nto curb sales of certain ASML equipment from being sold to China’s chipmakers. While the third quarter of 2023 generally exhibited\nimprovements in the lead times of component supply, there are families of components which have not yet reached their pre COVID-\n19 supply lead times. Given the current uncertainty of the global markets, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate long-term\nimpact that the shortage of semiconductors (or other components) will have on our business.\n- 17 -\nRisks Related to Operations in Israel\nConditions in Israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to produce and sell our products or raise finance and\ninstability in the Middle East may adversely affect us.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel, and our principal executive offices and principal research and\ndevelopment facilities are located in the State of Israel. Political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations.\nThere has been an increase in unrest and terrorist activity in Israel, which has continued with varying levels of severity for many years\nthrough the current period of time. This has led to ongoing hostilities between Israel, the Palestinian Authority, other groups in the West\nBank and the Gaza Strip, and the northern border with Lebanon, as well as in the Golan Heights. The future effect of these conflicts on\nthe Israeli economy and our operations is unclear. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict may also lead to political instability between Israel\nand its neighboring countries.\nPolitical events in various countries in the Middle East, such as Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon and Egypt, have weakened the\nstability of those countries, and have allowed extreme terrorists organizations, such as ISIS and Hamas, to operate in certain territories\nin the Middle East. This instability may lead to deterioration of the geo-political conditions in the Middle East. In addition, this instability\nhas affected the global economy and marketplace through fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Any events that affect the State of Israel\nmay impact us in unpredictable ways. For example, the global movement for a campaign of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)\nagainst Israel may adversely affect our sales in certain countries. We have contingency plans for alternative manufacturing and supply\nsources, but these plans may prove to be insufficient. Should our operations be impacted in a significant way, this may materially and\nadversely affect the results of our operations.\nOn October 7, 2023, terrorists from Hamas and other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza\nStrip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets, including widespread killings and kidnappings. Shortly following\nthe attack, Israel declared war against Hamas. In addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued hostilities\nalong Israel’s northern border with Hamas supporters, including Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization) and Syria. The\naggressors have utilized, and could continue to use, terror, rocket and drone attacks, which target locations throughout Israel and cause\nsubstantial disruption and damage. Israel may not be able to defend effectively against such attacks and such attacks could have a\nmaterial and adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition. Additionally, the Houthi movement, which controls\nparts of Yemen, launched a number of rocket attacks targeting Israel’s southern border and attacks on marine vessels traversing the Red\nSea, which marine vessels were thought to either be in route towards Israel or to be partly owned by Israeli businessmen. It is possible\nthat these hostilities will escalate, and that other terrorist organizations, including the Palestinian military organizations in the West\nBank as well as other hostile countries, such as Iran, will join the hostilities.\nTo date, none of our facilities or infrastructure have been damaged nor have our supply chains been significantly impacted\nsince the war commenced in October 2023. However, we cannot predict the ultimate effect that the ongoing war and hostilities will have\non us, including our supply chain and our ability to ship products from Israel, and any increase in these hostilities or any future armed\nconflict, political instability or violence in the region. Additionally, some of our officers and employees in Israel are obligated to perform\nannual military reserve duty and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances. For example, in\nconnection with the war with Hamas and conflicts with its supporters described above, some of our employees were called up to serve\nin the army. Some of our employees live within conflict area territories and may be forced to stay at home instead of reporting to work.\nIf many of our employees are called for active duty, or forced to stay at home, our operations in Israel and our business may be materially\nand adversely affected.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism.\nAlthough the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of property damage and certain direct and indirect damages\nthat are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, such coverage would likely be limited, may not be applicable to our business (either\ndue to the geographic location of our offices or the type of business that we operate) and may not reinstate our loss of revenue or\neconomic losses more generally. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will\nsufficiently cover our potential damages, or whether such coverage would be timely provided. Any losses or damages incurred by us as\na result of the current conflict in Israel, or any similar conflicts in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial conditions and results of operations.\n- 18 -\nAdditionally, a number of countries and organizations continue to restrict or ban business with Israel or Israeli companies, or\ncompanies doing business with Israel or Israeli companies, which may limit our ability to make sales in those countries. The war with\nHamas and conflicts with its supporters have also led to a reduction in the number of airlines and flights to Israel as well as a threat to\nshipping lines. In addition, there have been increased efforts by activists to cause companies and consumers to boycott Israeli goods\nbased on Israeli government policies. Such actions, particularly if they become more widespread, may adversely impact our ability to\nsell our products. Moreover, any deterioration in the capital markets resulting directly or indirectly from the ongoing conflict could limit\nour ability to obtain external financing.\nWe cannot predict the full impact of the war with Hamas and the related conditions on us in the future, particularly if emergency\ncircumstances or geopolitical tensions continue, any aspect of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\nposition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are adversely affected by the changes in the value of the dollar against the NIS and could be adversely affected by the rate\nof inflation in Israel, and we may incur losses as a result of our forward contracts and other hedging activities.\nWe generate most of our revenues in dollars and, in 2023, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily salaries, related\npersonnel expenses and the leases of our buildings in Israel, were incurred in NIS. We anticipate that a significant portion of our expenses\nwill continue to be denominated in NIS.\nOur NIS related costs, as expressed in dollars, are influenced by the exchange rate between the dollar and the NIS. During 2023\nand 2022, the NIS depreciated against the dollar, which resulted in a decrease in the dollars cost of our operations in Israel and during\n2021, the NIS appreciated against the dollar, which resulted in an increase in the dollar cost of our operations in Israel. To the extent the\ndollar weakens against the NIS, we could experience an increase in the cost of our operations, which are measured in dollars in our\nfinancial statements, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, in periods in which the dollar appreciates against\nthe NIS, we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in Israel will exceed the rate of such devaluation of the NIS in relation to the dollar or\nthat the timing of such devaluations lags considerably behind inflation, which will increase our costs as expressed in dollars.\nA decrease in value of the dollar in relation to the NIS could have the effect of increasing the cost in dollars of these expenses.\nOur dollar-measured results of operations were adversely affected in 2021 and 2020 when the NIS appreciated substantially against the\ndollar. This could happen again if the dollar were to decrease in value against the NIS.\nIn order to manage the risks imposed by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, from time to time, we enter into currency\nforward and put and call options contracts to hedge some of our foreign currency exposure. While we have sought to hedge certain\nexposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of such instruments, we cannot assure that foreign currency\nfluctuations will not have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business. Our use of\nderivative transactions, including forward contracts, could additionally expose us to the risk of financial loss upon unexpected or unusual\nvariations in the macroeconomy. Likewise, if we wish to maintain the dollar-denominated value of our products in non-U.S. markets,\ndevaluation in the local currencies of our customers relative to the dollar may cause our customers to cancel or decrease orders or default\non payment. We can provide no assurance that our hedging arrangements will be effective nor that the strategies underlying these\narrangements will be successful, if at all. If any of the strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of currency exchange\nrisk is not effective, we may incur additional losses.\nBecause exchange rates between the NIS and the dollar continually fluctuate, exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our\nprofitability and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. For example, in 2023, the value of the dollar increased in\nrelation to the NIS by 3.1% and the inflation rate in Israel was 3.0%. In 2022, the value of the dollar increased in relation to the NIS by\n13.2% and the inflation rate in Israel was 5.3%. In 2021, the value of the dollar decreased in relation to the NIS by 3.3% and the inflation\nrate in Israel was 2.8%. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected in case of a decrease in the value of the dollar\nto the NIS.\n- 19 -\nThe government grants we have received for research and development expenditures limit our ability to manufacture products\nand transfer technologies outside of Israel and require us to satisfy specified conditions. If we fail to comply with or satisfy these\nconditions, we may be required to refund grants previously received together with interest and penalties and/or be charged with\na criminal offense.\nIn connection with research and development grants we received from the Israel Innovation Authority, or the IIA, we must pay\nroyalties to the IIA on the revenue derived from the sale of products, technologies and services developed with the grants from the IIA.\nThe terms of the IIA grants and the law pursuant to which grants are made restrict our ability to manufacture products or transfer\ntechnologies outside of Israel if the IIA grants funded the development of the products or technology, without special approvals from\nthe IIA. Furthermore, the consideration available to our shareholders in a transaction involving the transfer outside of Israel of technology\nor know-how developed with the IIA funding (such as a merger or similar transaction) may be reduced by an amount of up to six times\nof the amounts of grants that we received from the IIA the plus interest, less any royalties that we already paid. These restrictions may\nlimit our ability to enter into agreements for such transactions without the IIA approval. We cannot be certain that any approval of the\nIIA will be obtained on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have a contingent obligation to pay royalties in the amount of approximately $21.3 million,\nrelated to historical grants received by two of our subsidiaries.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us, our officers and directors, assert U.S. securities law claims in Israel or\nserve process on substantially all of our officers and directors.\nWe are incorporated in Israel. Most of our executive officers and directors are nonresidents of the United States, and a majority\nof our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult to enforce a judgment\nobtained in the United States against us or any such persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the United States.\nIsraeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum to\nbring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is\napplicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact which can be\na time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law\nin Israel addressing these matters. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the Securities Act and the\nExchange Act in original actions instituted in Israel.\nIsraeli law and provisions in our articles of association may delay, prevent or make difficult a merger with or an acquisition of\nus, which could prevent a change of control and therefore depress the price of our shares.\nProvisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make undesirable a merger or an acquisition of all or a significant portion of\nour shares or assets. Israeli corporate law regulates acquisitions of shares through tender offers and mergers, requires special approvals\nfor transactions involving significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions. These\nprovisions of Israeli law could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may make it more difficult for a third\nparty to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions may limit the price that investors may be\nwilling to pay in the future for our ordinary shares. In addition, our articles of association contain certain provisions that may make it\nmore difficult to acquire us, such as a staggered board, the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock and limitations on\nbusiness combinations with interested shareholders. Furthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions undesirable\nto us or to some of our shareholders.\n- 20 -\nThe rights and responsibilities of our shareholders are governed by Israeli law which may differ in some respects from the rights\nand responsibilities of shareholders of U.S. corporations.\nSince we are incorporated under Israeli law, the rights and responsibilities of our shareholders are governed by our articles of\nassociation and Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders\nin United States corporations. In particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith and in a customary manner\nin exercising its rights and performing its obligations towards the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing its power\nin the company, including, among other things, in voting at a general meeting of shareholders on certain matters, such as an amendment\nto a company’s articles of association, an increase of a company’s authorized share capital, a merger of a company and approval of\nrelated party transactions that require shareholder approval. In addition, a controlling shareholder or a shareholder who knows that it\npossesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholders’ vote or to appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder in a\ncompany or has another power with respect to a company, has a duty to act in fairness towards the company. However, Israeli law does\nnot define the substance of this duty of fairness. Some of the parameters and implications of the provisions that govern shareholder\nbehavior have not been clearly determined. These provisions may be interpreted to impose additional obligations and liabilities on our\nshareholders that are not typically imposed on shareholders of United States corporations.\nRegulatory, Legal and Tax Risks\nChanges in governmental regulations in the United States or other countries could slow the growth of the VoIP telephony market\nand reduce the demand for our customers’ products, which, in turn, could reduce the demand for our products.\nVoIP and other services are not currently subject to all of the same regulations that apply to traditional telephony. Nevertheless,\nit is possible that foreign or U.S. federal or state legislatures may seek to impose increased fees and administrative burdens on VoIP,\ndata, and video providers. The FCC requires VoIP service providers to meet various emergency service requirements relating to delivery\nof 911 calls, known as E911, and to accommodate law enforcement interception or wiretapping requirements, such as the\nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA. In addition, the FCC may seek to impose other traditional telephony\nrequirements such as disability access requirements, consumer protection requirements, number assignment and portability\nrequirements, and other obligations, including additional obligations regarding E911 and CALEA. The cost of complying with FCC\nregulations or similar regulations in other countries could increase the cost of providing Internet phone service which could result in\nslower growth and decreased profitability for this industry, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe enactment of any additional regulation or taxation of communications over the Internet in the United States or elsewhere\nin the world could have a material adverse effect on our customers’ (and their customers’) businesses and could therefore adversely\naffect sales of our products. We do not know what effect, if any, possible legislation or regulatory actions in the United States or\nelsewhere in the world may have on private telecommunication networks, the provision of VoIP services and purchases of our products.\nUse of encryption technology in our products is regulated by governmental authorities and may require special development,\nexport or import licenses. Delays in the issuance of required licenses, or the inability to secure these licenses, could adversely\naffect our revenues and results of operations.\nGrowth in the demand for security features may increase the use of encryption technology in our products. The use of encryption\ntechnology is generally regulated by governmental authorities and may require specific development, export or import licenses.\nEncryption standards may be based on proprietary technologies. We may be unable to incorporate encryption standards into our products\nin a manner that will ensure interoperability. We also may be unable to secure licenses for proprietary technology on reasonable terms.\nIf we cannot meet encryption standards, or secure required licenses for proprietary encryption technology, our revenues and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\n- 21 -\nOur proprietary technology is difficult to protect, and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third\nparties. Our business may suffer if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if we are sued for infringing the\nintellectual property rights of third parties.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of\npatent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect\nour proprietary rights. These agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third-party infringement,\nor to protect us from the claims of others.\nEnforcement of intellectual property rights may be expensive and may divert attention of management and of research and\ndevelopment personnel away from our business. Intellectual property litigation could also call into question the ownership or scope of\nrights owned by us. Additionally, our products may be manufactured, sold, or used in countries that provide less protection to intellectual\nproperty than that provided under U.S. or Israeli laws or where we do not hold relevant intellectual property rights.\nMoreover, a number of aspects of intellectual property protection in the field of AI are currently under development, and there\nis uncertainty and ongoing litigation in different jurisdictions as to the degree and extent of protection warranted for AI and machine\nlearning systems, as well as relevant system input and outputs. If we fail to obtain protection for the intellectual property rights\nconcerning our AI technologies, or later have our intellectual property rights invalidated or otherwise diminished, our competitors may\nbe able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products, and our business, financial condition\nand operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe believe that the frequency of third-party intellectual property claims is increasing, as patent holders, including entities that\nare not in our industry and that purchase patents as an investment or to monetize such rights by obtaining royalties, use infringement\nassertions as a competitive tactic and a source of additional revenue. Any intellectual property claims against us, even if without merit,\ncould cost us a significant amount of money to defend and divert management’s attention away from our business. We may not be able\nto secure a license for technology that is used in our products, and we may face injunctive proceedings that prevent distribution and sale\nof our products even prior to any dispute being concluded. These proceedings may also have a deterrent effect on purchases by\ncustomers, who may be unsure about our ability to continue to supply their requirements. We may be forced to repurchase our products\nand compensate customers that have purchased such infringing products. We may be forced to redesign a product so that it becomes\nnon-infringing, which may have an adverse impact on our results of our operations.\nIn addition, claims alleging that the development, use, or sale of our products infringes third parties’ intellectual property rights\nmay be directed either at us or at our direct or indirect customers. We may be required to indemnify such customers against claims made\nagainst them. We may be required to indemnify them even if we believe that the claim of infringement is without merit.\nMultiple patent holders in our industry may result in increased licensing costs.\nThere are a number of companies besides us that hold patents for various aspects of the technology incorporated in our\nindustry’s standards and our products. We expect that patent enforcement will be given high priority by companies seeking to gain\ncompetitive advantages or additional revenues. We have been sued a number of times in recent years for alleged patent infringement. If\nholders of patents take the position that we are required to obtain a license from them, we cannot be certain that we would be able to\nnegotiate a license agreement at an acceptable price or at all. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by the payment of\nany additional licensing costs or if we are prevented from manufacturing or selling a product.\n- 22 -\nWe are subject to regulations that require us to use components based on environmentally friendly materials. We may be subject\nto various regulations relating to management and disposal of waste with respect to electronic equipment. Compliance with\nthese regulations has increased our costs. Failure to comply with these regulations could materially adversely affect our business\nand results of operations.\nWe are subject to an increasing number of directives and regulations requiring the use of environmentally-friendly materials.\nFor example, pursuant to a European Community directive, equipment suppliers are required to stop using specified materials that are\nnot environmentally friendly. Some of our customers may also require products that meet higher standards than those required by the\ndirective, such as complete removal of additional harmful substances from our products. We are dependent on our suppliers for\ncomponents and sub-system modules, such as semiconductors and purchased assemblies and goods, to comply with these requirements.\nThis may harm our ability to sell our products in regions or to customers that may adopt such directives. Compliance with these directives\nhas required us to incur significant expenses with respect to meeting the basic requirements and the updates of those regulations and of\nimplementing new similar regulations and directives. In addition, we may be required to pay higher prices for components that comply\nwith those directives. We may not be able to pass these higher component costs on to our customers. Compliance with these directives\nhas increased and could continue to increase our product design and manufacturing costs. New designs may also require qualification\ntesting with both customers and government certification boards.\nSome of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the\nenvironment, including laws governing the management and disposal of waste with respect to electronic equipment. We could incur\nsubstantial costs, including fines and civil or criminal sanctions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if\nour products become non-compliant with environmental laws. We also face increasing complexity in our product design and\nprocurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials that compose our products. The European\nUnion, or the EU, has enacted the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive which makes producers of electrical goods\nfinancially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. Similar legislation\nhas been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, China and Japan.\nOur inability or failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In\naddition, manufacturers of components that do not meet the new requirements may decide to stop manufacturing those components prior\nto the required compliance date. These actions by manufacturers of components could result in a shortage of components that could\nadversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur use of open source software could materially and adversely affect our ability to offer our products, subject us to actual and\nthreatened litigation, and cause substantial harm to our financial condition and operations, generally.\nWe have used, and could continue to use, open source software in connection with the development and deployment of our\nsoftware products. To the extent we continue to utilize open source software in the future, it could in some instances subject us to certain\nunfavorable conditions, including requirements that we offer our products that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we\nmake publicly available all or part of the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or\nusing any such open source software, or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open\nsource license. Companies that have elected to incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, been subject\nto claims challenging the use of such open source software and compliance with the terms of such use. Accordingly, we could be made\nparty to a lawsuit by a third party claiming ownership of what we believe to constitute open source software or otherwise asserting\nnoncompliance with the terms of such use. While we seek to monitor and track our use of open source software in an attempt to mitigate\nthe risk of needing to disclose any proprietary source code, or that would otherwise breach the terms of any open source agreement, we\ncannot guarantee that our efforts will be successful and that all open source software has been, or will be, reviewed prior to its\nincorporation into our products.\n- 23 -\nGiven the lack of judicial precedent and guidance regarding each specific open software license type, there is a risk that open\nsource software licenses that we utilize could be interpreted in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions and restrictions on our\nability to offer, provide and market our products and services. If we are ultimately found to have breached or failed to comply with any\nof the terms and conditions associated with any open source software license, we could be subject to, among other things, infringement\nclaims and others forms of liability, or be required to obtain costly licenses from third parties to continue to provide our products and\nservices on terms that are not economically advantageous or feasible, if at all. Additionally, use of open source software generally carries\ngreater legal risks than does the use of third-party commercial software, and therefore, any open source software utilized will generally\nbe provided without any contractual protections, warranties or other support. Any of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely\naffect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nWe must comply with continually evolving privacy-related laws regulations in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to\nAI.\nOur use and handling of personally identifiable data is regulated at the international, federal and state levels, and we are subject\nto a variety of local and international privacy laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, processing, export\nand security of personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly\ndemanding. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, implemented\nstringent operational requirements for companies that are established in the EU or, where not established in the EU, offer goods or\nservices to individuals in the EU or monitor the behavior of individuals in the EU. Failure to comply with the GDPR can result in fines\nof up to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. The\nrelated UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act of 2018, which ensures that the United Kingdom has in effect the same high standards\nfor data protection in place as under the GDPR, impose stringent operational requirements in the United Kingdom (including through\nrestrictions on processing of personal data and cross-border transfers of personal data, and mandatory breach reporting to regulators and,\nunder certain circumstances, to the individuals whose personal data was compromised in the breach).\nThe requirements of the GDPR include, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is processed, mandatory\ndata breach notification requirements, a strengthened data subject rights regime and higher standards for obtaining consent from\nindividuals to process their personal data (including in certain circumstances for marketing), all of which involve significant ongoing\nexpenditure. The principle of accountability likewise requires us to put significant documentation in place to demonstrate compliance.\nWhile the GDPR in large part harmonizes data protection requirements across EU countries, some provisions allow EU Member States\nto adopt additional or different requirements, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could require localized\nchanges. We may also be affected by legal challenges to the validity of EU mechanisms for transfers of personal data outside the EU,\nand our business could be impacted by changes in law as a result of future review of these mechanisms by European regulators under\nthe GDPR, as well as current challenges to these mechanisms in the European courts.\nOther new laws and regulations are rapidly coming into effect while existing legislation is quickly evolving. In the United\nStates, the SEC adopted new rules requiring public companies to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident, including\nany breach of personal data, within four business days of determining that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. The final\nrule applicable to the cybersecurity disclosure to be included in our (i) Current Reports on Form 6-K became effective on December 18,\n2023 and (ii) Annual Report on Form 20-F became effective for any fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2023. Likewise, several\nprivacy laws in the United States came into effect in 2023, including in California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, and new\nstate privacy laws will come into effect in 2024, including in Montana, Oregon and Texas, all of which give new data privacy rights to\ntheir respective residents and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\n- 24 -\nThere is additionally increasing U.S. and foreign activity in the regulation of AI, and other similar uses of technology. For\nexample, in Europe, there is a proposed regulation (the Artificial Intelligence Act) that, if adopted and approved, could impose onerous\nand substantial obligations related to the use of AI-related systems. Additionally, several states and localities in the United States have\nenacted measures related to the use of AI and machine learning in products and services. In October 2023, the President of the United\nStates issued an executive order on the Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI, emphasizing the need for\ntransparency, accountability and fairness in the development and use of AI tools, and AI is the subject of evolving review by various\ngovernmental and regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the Federal Trade Commission. Depending on how these AI laws and\nregulations are interpreted, and to the extent that our business practices, products and services utilize AI, we could be subject to, and\nneed to comply with, such obligations. Moreover, our development and use of AI, and the uncertain regulatory environment, could result\nin reputational harm, liability or other material and adverse consequences to our financial condition and business operations. The\nintroduction of AI technologies into new or existing products may also result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny,\nlitigation, confidentiality or security risks, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation,\nor financial results. The intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies has not\nbeen fully addressed by courts or national or local laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of third-party AI technologies into our\nproducts and services may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation.\nUncertainty around new and emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, may require additional investment in the development\nand maintenance of proprietary datasets and machine learning models, development of new approaches and processes to provide\nattribution or remuneration to creators of training data, and development of appropriate protections and safeguards for handling the use\nof customer data with AI technologies, which may be costly and could impact our expenses if we decide to expand generative AI into\nour product offerings. AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or\nflawed. Our customers or others may rely on or use this flawed content to their detriment, which may expose us to brand or reputational\nharm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. The use of AI technologies presents emerging ethical and social issues, and if we enable\nor offer solutions that draw scrutiny or controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on customers or on society as a whole, we\nmay experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability.\nExisting privacy-related laws and regulations in the United States and other countries are evolving and are subject to potentially\ndiffering interpretations, and various U.S. federal and state or other international legislative and regulatory bodies may expand or enact\nlaws regarding privacy and data security-related matters. Due to the fact that privacy and information security laws and regulations are\nsubject to change from time to time, our compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the\ndevelopment of new processes. Any new or modified laws and regulations may require that we modify our data processing practices\nand policies, and incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply with such laws and regulations. These laws are complex\nand there is no ubiquitous approach to maintaining compliance. Requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is\ninconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. If we fail to comply with any of these\nlaws and regulations, we could be subjected to legal risk and other adverse effects to our business and operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in several countries. Tax matters, including changes in tax laws or rates, adverse determinations by\ntaxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we operate in several countries, we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, including Israel, the United States\nand certain other countries where we have operations. We are required to report to and are subject to local tax authorities in the countries\nin which we operate. In addition, our income that is derived from sales to customers in one country might also be subject to taxation in\nother countries. We cannot be sure of the amount of tax we may become obligated to pay in the countries in which we operate. The tax\nauthorities in the countries in which we operate may not agree with our tax position. Our tax benefits from carryforward tax losses and\nother tax planning benefits, such as Israeli Technological Preferred Enterprise and Approved Enterprise programs, may prove to be\ninsufficient due to Israeli tax limitations or may prove to be insufficient to offset tax liabilities from foreign tax authorities. Foreign tax\nauthorities may also use our gross profit or our revenues in each territory as the basis for determining our income tax, and our operating\nexpenses might not be considered for related tax calculations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n- 25 -\nU.S. shareholders face certain income tax risks in connection with their acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary\nshares. In any tax year, we could be deemed a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences for U.S. shareholders.\nBased on the composition of our gross income, the composition and value of our gross assets and the amounts of our liabilities\nfor each taxable year from 2005 through 2023, we do not believe that we were a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes during any of such tax years. There can be no assurance that we will not become a PFIC in the current tax\nyear or any future tax year in which, for example, the value of our assets, as measured by the public market valuation of our ordinary\nshares, declines in relation to the value of our passive assets (generally, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities). If we are a\nPFIC for any tax year, U.S. shareholders who own our ordinary shares during such year may be subject to increased U.S. federal income\ntax liabilities and reporting requirements for such year and succeeding years, even if we cease to be a PFIC in such succeeding years. A\nU.S. holder of our ordinary shares will be required to file an information return containing certain information required by the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Service for each year in which we are treated as a PFIC with respect to such holder.\nWe urge U.S. holders of our ordinary shares to carefully review Item 10.E, “Additional Information—Taxation—U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Considerations” in this Annual Report and to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax\nrisks related to owning and disposing of our ordinary shares and the consequences of PFIC status.\nIf a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares, such holder may be subject to adverse U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences.\nIf a United States person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the value or voting power\nof our ordinary shares, such person may be treated as a “United States shareholder” with respect to us and each “controlled foreign\ncorporation” in our group (if any). Because our group includes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could\nbe treated as controlled foreign corporations (regardless of whether or not we are treated as a controlled foreign corporation). A United\nStates shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to report annually and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro\nrata share of “Subpart F income,” “global intangible low-taxed income,” and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign\ncorporations, regardless of whether we make any distributions. An individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a\ncontrolled foreign corporation generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a\nUnited States shareholder that is a U.S. corporation. Failure to comply with these reporting obligations may subject a United States\nshareholder to significant monetary penalties and may prevent the statute of limitations with respect to such shareholder’s U.S. federal\nincome tax return for the year for which reporting was due from starting. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors\nin determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or whether any investor is\ntreated as a United States shareholder with respect to us or any such controlled foreign corporation or furnish to any United States\nshareholders information that may be necessary to comply with the aforementioned reporting and tax paying obligations. A United\nStates investor should consult its advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to an investment in our ordinary shares.\nWe are subject to ongoing costs and risks associated with complying with extensive corporate governance and disclosure\nrequirements.\nAs a foreign private issuer subject to U.S. federal securities laws, we spend a significant amount of management time and\nresources to comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,\nor the Dodd-Frank Act, regulations promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and Nasdaq\nlisting rules. While we have developed and instituted corporate compliance programs and continue to update our programs in response\nto newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all\npotentially applicable corporate regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of\nregulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation. In connection with our compliance with the internal control provisions of Section\n404 and the other applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount\nof time, and may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff, to assure that we comply with these requirements. The additional\nmanagement attention and costs relating to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other corporate\ngovernance requirements could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n- 26 -\nThe internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements because of certain of its limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls,\nor fraud. As a result, even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and\npresentation of financial statements. We cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness\nin connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting\nfirm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 20-F or state that we have maintained\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. Discovery and disclosure of a material weakness in\nour internal control over financial reporting could have a material impact on our financial statements and could cause our stock price to\ndecline.\nOther new laws and regulations are rapidly coming into effect or are being contemplated, which create further corporate\ngovernance and disclosure requirements. For example, the SEC recently adopted new rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management,\nStrategy, Governance and Incident Disclosure, which will require reporting companies, including us, to report information relating to\ncertain cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in disclosures required to be made under the federal securities laws and may\nincrease our costs of doing business, expose us to potential compliance risk, including the ability to make timely disclosures to the\npublic, and impact the manner in which we operate. Any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those\nof third parties important to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand prospect. Additionally, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of AI technologies and our obligations to comply with emerging\nlaws and regulations may require us to develop additional AI-specific governance programs and comply with related disclosure regimes.\nThere remains increased focus from lawmakers and regulators on corporate ESG practices, including climate change and related\nESG disclosure requirements. Expectations regarding voluntary ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs (including\nbut not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, contracting and insurance), changes in demand for\ncertain products, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition or results\nof operations. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve, and our business may be impacted by\nnew laws, regulations or investor criteria in the United States, Europe and around the world related to ESG. In March 2024, the SEC\nadopted new rules that will require registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual\nreports. The rules require information about a registrant's climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on its\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition. The required information about climate-related risks will also include disclosure\nof a registrant's greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the rules will require registrants to present certain climate-related financial\nmetrics in their audited financial statements. The SEC’s newly adopted climate-related disclosure rules may require us to incur\nsignificant additional costs to comply, including the implementation of significant additional internal controls processes and procedures\nregarding matters that have not been subject to such controls in the past and expanded data collection, analysis and certification with\nrespect to greenhouse gas emissions reporting that may not be complete or accurate, and impose increased oversight obligations on our\nmanagement and board of directors. These and other regulations, disclosure-related and otherwise, including California laws S.B. 253,\nS.B. 261 and A.B. 1305 and the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, may increase our costs as well as increase scrutiny\nregarding our ESG efforts, which may enhance the risks discussed in this risk factor. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well\nas investor expectations related to ESG practices and disclosures are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and\nexpensive for us to comply with. If we fail to adapt to or comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, our\nbusiness and reputation could be negatively impacted, and our share price and access to/cost of capital could be materially and adversely\naffected. Additionally, many of our customers and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create\nadditional risks, including risks that may not be known to us.\n- 27 -\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of our Ordinary Shares\nThe price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price for our ordinary shares, as well as the prices of shares of other technology companies, has been volatile.\nBetween January 1, 2018 and March 20, 2024, the trading price of our shares on Nasdaq has fluctuated from a low of $6.62 to a high of\n$44.94. The following factors may cause significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares:\n• fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and earnings or those of our competitors;\n• shortfalls in our operating results compared to levels forecast by securities analysts or by us;\n• announcements concerning us, our competitors or telephone companies;\n• announcements of technological innovations;\n• the introduction of new products;\n• changes in product price policies involving us or our competitors;\n• market conditions in the industry;\n• integration of acquired businesses, technologies or joint ventures with our products and operations;\n• the conditions of the securities markets, particularly in the technology and Israeli sectors; and\n• political, economic and other developments in the State of Israel and worldwide.\nIn addition, stock prices of many technology companies fluctuate significantly for reasons that may be unrelated or\ndisproportionate to operating results. The factors discussed above may depress or cause volatility of our share price, regardless of our\nactual operating results.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect these fluctuations to continue. Any actual or\nanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations could require that we issue revised guidance, and the failure to meet the\nexpectations of our investors or analysts could have a material and adverse impact on our share price.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations. In\nsome periods, our operating results may be significantly below public expectations or below revenue levels and operating results reached\nin prior quarters or in the corresponding quarters of the previous year. If this occurs, the market price of our ordinary shares could be\nmaterially and adversely impacted. Accordingly, comparisons of our revenues and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not\nbe meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\n- 28 -\nThe following factors, among others, have affected our quarterly results of operations in the past and are likely to affect our\nquarterly results of operations in the near- and long-term:\n• size, timing and pricing of orders, including order deferrals and delayed shipments;\n• launching of new product generations;\n• length of approval processes or market testing;\n• technological changes in the telecommunications industry;\n• competitive pricing pressures;\n• the timing and approval of government research and development grants;\n• accuracy of telecommunication company, distributor and original equipment manufacturer forecasts of their\ncustomers’ demands;\n• changes in our operating expenses;\n• disruption in our sources of supply;\n• temporary or permanent reduction in purchases by our significant customers; and\n• general economic conditions, including macroeconomic factors not within our control.\nAccordingly, our operating results have been and may continue to be difficult to predict, even in the near term, and\nconsequently, the results of any past periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nOur actual financial results might vary from our publicly disclosed financial forecasts.\nFrom time to time, we publicly disclose financial forecasts and other performance metrics. Our forecasts reflect numerous\nassumptions concerning our expected performance, as well as other factors which are beyond our control, and which might not turn out\nto be correct. As a result, variations from our forecasts could be material. Our financial results are subject to numerous risks and\nuncertainties, including those identified throughout this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report. If our actual\nfinancial results are worse than our financial forecasts, the price of our ordinary shares may decline. A large portion of our sales is made\nduring the last month of each quarter. As a result, any delay in our receipt of orders could affect our results for a quarter and the accuracy\nof our forecasts.\nIt is our policy that we will generally not provide quarterly forecasts of the results of our operations. This policy could affect the\nwillingness of analysts to provide research with respect to our ordinary shares, which could affect the trading market for our\nordinary shares.\nIt is our policy that we will generally not provide quarterly forecasts of the results of our operations. This could result in the\nreduction of research analysts who cover our ordinary shares. Any reduction in research coverage could affect the willingness of\ninvestors, particularly institutional investors, to invest in our shares which could affect the trading market for our ordinary shares and\nthe price at which our ordinary shares are traded.\n- 29 -\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on Nasdaq, we follow certain home country corporate governance practices\ninstead of certain Nasdaq requirements.\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on Nasdaq, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate\ngovernance practices instead of certain requirements contained in the Nasdaq listing rules. We do not comply with the Nasdaq\nrequirement that we obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as for the establishment or amendment of certain share-\nbased compensation plans. Instead, we follow Israeli law and practice which permits the establishment or amendment of certain share-\nbased compensation plans to be approved by our board of directors without the need for a shareholder vote, unless such arrangements\nare for the compensation of directors or the chief executive officer, in which case they also require compensation committee and\nshareholder approval.\nAs a foreign private issuer listed on the Nasdaq, we may also elect in the future to follow home country practice with regard\nto, among other things, director nominations, composition of the board of directors and quorum at shareholders’ meetings, as well as\nnot obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events. Accordingly, our shareholders may not be afforded the same protection as\nprovided under Nasdaq’s corporate governance rules.\nOur ordinary shares are listed for trading in more than one market, and this may result in price variations.\nOur ordinary shares are listed for trading on Nasdaq and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd., or the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange,\nor the TASE, under the Israeli regulatory “dual listing” regime that provides companies whose securities are listed both on Nasdaq and\nthe TASE certain reporting leniencies. Trading in our ordinary shares on these markets is made in different currencies (dollars on Nasdaq\nand NIS on TASE), and at different times (resulting from different time zones, different trading days and different public holidays in\nthe United States and Israel). Actual trading volume on the TASE is generally lower than trading volume on Nasdaq, and as such could\nbe subject to higher volatility. The trading prices of our ordinary shares on these two markets often differ resulting from the factors\ndescribed above, as well as differences in exchange rates. Any decrease in the trading price of our ordinary shares on one of these\nmarkets could cause a decrease in the trading price of our ordinary shares on the other market.\nWhile our ordinary shares are currently listed on the TASE, there is no guarantee as to how long such listing will be maintained.\nWe plan to continuously examine the advisability of maintaining our listing on the TASE. We may in the future voluntarily\ndelist our securities from the TASE, provided we furnish notice thereof at least 90 days in advance of such delisting. If our ordinary\nshares are delisted, some holders of our ordinary shares that are traded on the TASE may be required or will choose to sell their shares,\nwhich could result in a decrease in the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or continue repurchases of our ordinary shares.\nSince July 2018, our Board of Directors have elected to declare cash dividends on our ordinary shares each year. Prior to the\ndeclaration of these dividends, we had never declared a cash dividend. Under the Israeli Companies Law, 1999, or the Companies Law,\nwe may pay dividends only out of our profits as determined for statutory purposes, unless court approval is granted for the payment of\ndividends despite the lack of statutory profits. Accordingly, the declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the Board’s\ndiscretion and will be dependent upon future earnings, cash flows, the requirements of the Companies Law, the receipt of court approval,\nif required, and other factors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends on our ordinary shares.\nIn addition, since 2014, we have received court approvals each year for share repurchases up to specified amounts. Our share\nrepurchases have and will take place in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made from time to\ntime depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume or other factors. The repurchase program does not require us to\npurchase a specific number of shares and may be suspended from time to time or discontinued. There can be no assurance that we will\ncontinue to seek court approval of, or that we will complete, additional share repurchases.\n- 30 -\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe have a significant presence in international markets and plan to continue to expand our international operations, which\nexposes us to a number of risks that could affect our future growth.\nWe have a worldwide sales, marketing and support infrastructure that is comprised of independent distributors and value-added\nresellers, and our own personnel resulting in a sales, marketing and support presence in many countries, including markets in North\nAmerica, Western and Eastern Europe, the Asia Pacific region and Latin America. We expect to continue to increase our sales headcount,\nour applications development headcount, our field support headcount, our marketing headcount and our engineering headcount and, in\nsome cases, establish new relationships with distributors, particularly in markets where we currently do not have a sales or customer\nsupport presence. As we continue to expand our international sales and operations, we are subject to a number of risks, including the\nfollowing:\n• greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection, as well as longer collection periods;\n• increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international\noperations;\n• fluctuations in exchange rates between the dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business;\n• greater difficulty in recruiting local experienced personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;\n• general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets (for example changes in oil prices and the global\neconomy have affected growth and ultimately the demand for our products in China);\n• economic uncertainty around the world;\n• management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;\n• risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements (such as privacy and cyber security), including\nthe importation, certification, and localization of our solutions required in foreign countries, such as high import taxes\nin Brazil and other Latin American markets where we sell our products;\n• greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties;\n• the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n• greater risk of a failure of employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices; and\n• heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain regions and of improper or fraudulent sales\narrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our revenues from outside of the United States or\nincrease our operating costs, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition and growth prospects. There\ncan be no assurance that all of our employees and channel partners will comply with the formal policies we have and will implement,\nor applicable laws and regulations. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees and channel partners could result in\ndelays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of\nour software and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n- 31 -\nWe depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace.\nThe success of our business depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our management and key personnel.\nSpecifically, we rely heavily on the services of Shabtai Adlersberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Lior Aldema, our\nChief Business Officer. Mr. Adlersberg is also a director. If our President and Chief Executive Officer or our Chief Business Officer are\nunable or unwilling to continue with us, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We do not carry key person\ninsurance for our key personnel.\nThe success of our business also depends upon our continuing ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management,\ntechnical, sales and marketing personnel. We require highly qualified technical personnel who are capable of developing technologies\nand products and providing the technical support required by our customers. We experience competitive pressure with respect to\nretaining and hiring employees in the high technology sector in Israel. In 2023, Israel faced a shortage of qualified technical personnel\nwith the requisite experience in the industry in which we operate. Specifically, there was a notable shortage of engineers who were\nfamiliar with the intricacies and bespoke aspects of our products and services. To the extent that such trends continue in 2024 (and\nbeyond) and we fail to hire and retain skilled employees, our business may be adversely affected, including our ability to deliver products\nand services on a timely basis. Moreover, to the extent we are able to successfully recruit and retain additional technical personnel, we\nmay be required to incur significant costs due to steep salary increases. Given the substantial demand for such services, we may be\nunsuccessful in attracting and retaining an adequate number of technical personnel to support our current operations and the potential\nexpansion of our business.\nRising wages and other labor-related costs could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe ability to execute our strategic plans is highly dependent on our ability to promote, retain and recruit a sufficient number\nof qualified personnel. Given the competition for qualified talent and rising wages in the technology industry in Israel, we face significant\nchallenges in finding, hiring and retaining qualified and highly-trained personnel. The tight labor market has resulted in higher labor-\nrelated costs, increased attrition rates and fundamental changes in the labor market and expectations of employees. In particular, our\ndesire to hire superior talent may require us to pay higher wages and provide enhanced benefits, which could cause us to incur higher\nlabor-related costs as compared to our competitors. We expect wages to continue to rise in Israel in the near-term, which will continue\nto impact our overall financial condition, cash flows and operations. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in hiring, retaining,\ntraining and promoting our personnel at current wage rates given that we are currently operating in a highly competitive labor market\nand further increases in market compensation could adversely impact our business.\nA data security or privacy breach could adversely affect our business and services.\nThe protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to our business and operations. Customers and other\nstakeholders have a high expectation that we will adequately protect and safeguard their personal data or other information from\ncyberattack or other security breaches. We rely on the information technology system that we manage, and those that are managed by\nthird parties with whom we engage, to conduct our business and operations, and these systems are subject to cybersecurity risks, potential\nattacks and breaches due to human error. We are additionally increasingly incorporating open source software into our products and\nthere may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Moreover, given the nature\nof cyberattacks, breaches and infiltration of our internal systems (or the systems of the third parties with whom we engage) could go\nunnoticed for extended periods of time and materially disrupt our operations, which could result in a material loss of revenue, substantial\ndowntime and loss of critical information and data. We may incur higher costs in order to remediate or correct the effects of any such\nincidents. Likewise, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected,\nwe may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such access, disclosure or other loss\nof information could therefore result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information,\ndisrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business,\nrevenues and competitive position. In addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers\nimplement reasonable security measures to protect our customers’ identity and privacy. We do not, however, control these third-party\nservice providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future.\n- 32 -\nFurthermore, a breach of customer, employee, or company data could also significantly damage our reputation and result in\nlost sales, fines, or lawsuits. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure and/or our products may be\nvulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach or attack could\ncompromise our networks, or customer networks in whole or in part, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly\ndisclosed, lost or stolen.\nCertain macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, which are outside of our control, as well as the evolution of methods and\ntechniques used by bad actors, may also make us more susceptible to a cybersecurity attack. For example, growing tensions between\nRussia and several western nations (and their respective allies) in connection with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, could\nresult in retaliatory actions being undertaken by supporters of Russia, including in the form of espionage, phishing campaigns and other\nforms of cyber-attacks. Moreover, pro-Russian ransomware cybercriminals and gangs have previously publicly threatened to augment\ntheir hacking efforts in response to the implementation of sanctions and other responsive actions taken by western countries (and their\nallies). Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the cost of compliance and\ncosts resulting from consumer fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially.\nThe methods and techniques used by cyber threat actors to gain entry into our network and access our computer systems,\nsoftware and data will become more advanced with the use of AI and may become increasingly difficult or impossible to detect and\nprevent. As these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our\ninformation security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. While our technology infrastructure is\ndesigned to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we have limited ability to monitor the implementation of similar\nsafeguards by our vendors.\nAny cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, corruption of data, misuse or theft\nof private or other sensitive information, or inadvertent acts by our own employees, could result in the disclosure or misuse of\nconfidential or proprietary information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients. If\nwe experience a significant data security breach, fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, or fail to\ncomply with the various cybersecurity regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights\nAct in the United States, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. These losses may exceed our\ninsurance coverage for such incidents. In addition, our employees and clients could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal\nand proprietary information, which could cause them to terminate their relationships with us. Any loss of confidence arising from a\nsignificant data security breach could hurt our reputation, further damaging our business.\nWe may desire to expand our business through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses. This\ncould disrupt our business and affect our results of operations.\nPart of our strategy is to pursue acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses and technologies or to establish joint ventures to\nexpand our business. The negotiation of acquisitions, investments or joint ventures, as well as the integration of acquired or jointly\ndeveloped businesses or technologies, could divert our management’s time and resources. Acquired businesses, technologies or joint\nventures may not be successfully integrated with our products and operations. The markets for the products produced by the companies\nwe acquire may take longer than we anticipated to develop and to result in increased sales and profits for us. We may not realize the\nintended benefits of any acquisition, investment or joint venture and we may incur losses from any acquisition, investment or joint\nventure.\nAcquisitions could result in:\n• substantial cash expenditures;\n• potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities;\n• the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n• a decrease in our profit margins;\n• amortization of intangibles and potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets;\n- 33 -\n• reduction of management attention to other parts of the business;\n• failure to invest in different areas or alternative investments;\n• failure to generate expected financial results or reach business goals;\n• increased expenditures on human resources and related costs; and\n• decreased growth of our professional services.\nIf acquisitions disrupt our sales or marketing efforts or operations, our business may suffer.\nIf we do not manage our operations effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have expanded our operations in the past and may continue to expand them in the future. This expansion has required, and\nmay continue to require, the application of managerial, operational and financial resources. We cannot be sure that we will continue to\nexpand, or that we will be able to expand our operations successfully. In particular, our business requires us to focus on multiple markets,\nincluding the VoIP, wireline, cable, enterprise unified communications and wireless markets. In addition, we work simultaneously with\na number of large OEMs and network equipment providers each of which may have different requirements for the products that we sell\nto them. We may not have sufficient personnel, or may be unable to devote our personnel when needed, to address the requirements of\nthese markets and customers. If we are unable to manage our operations effectively, our revenues may not increase, our cost of operations\nmay rise and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs we grow, we may need new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls. The transition to such systems, procedures or\ncontrols, as well as any delay in transitioning to new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may seriously harm our ability to\naccurately forecast sales demand, manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a\ntimely and accurate basis.\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nA. HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\nAudioCodes Ltd. was incorporated in 1992 under the laws of the State of Israel. We initially concentrated on low-bit-rate\nspeech compression technology, later moving into voice over packet, or VoP, chips, VoIP communication modules, blades and boards.\nIn 2001, we released an analog media gateway based on blade and chip technologies. This was followed by a family of VoIP media\ngateways combining analog and digital telephony interfaces. We then began developing high density VoIP media gateways and media\nservers. As the decade progressed, we expanded our product portfolio with session border controllers (2006), multi-service business\nrouters and gateways (2008) and IP phones (2011).\nOver the last decade, AudioCodes has developed a range of software-based voice productivity solutions through our Voice.AI\nbusiness line. These include the Voca range of conversational AI-related solutions and Microsoft Teams contact center that incorporate\nvoice recognition, AI and machine learning technologies, SmartTAP 360° Live, an intelligent, secure enterprise compliance recording\nsolution, Meeting Insights, an innovative tool for easily capturing and organizing all meeting-generated content and Voice.AI Connect,\na cloud-based solution that simplifies the integration of any cognitive voice service and bot framework with any voice or telephony\nchannel to deliver an enhanced customer service experience. See Item 3.D, “Key Information – Risk Factors – Our results of operations\ncould be materially and adversely affected if we cannot keep pace with technological changes impacting the development of our products\nand implementation of our business needs, including with respect to automation and the use of AI.”\n- 34 -\nThe advent of communications products running as software in virtualized environments or in the cloud required us to adapt\nour VoIP and digital signal processing, or DSP, technologies – including media processing, call signaling and management suite – to\nrun on COTS servers and become cloud-friendly and elastic, while maintaining the real-time characteristics needed for voice\ncommunications. In line with this trend, we adapted many of our products to the virtualized datacenters and cloud, including Mediant\nsession border controllers, or SBCs, and management applications, allowing for rapid deployment and true elasticity in private and\npublic clouds.\nIn addition to SBCs and Voice.AI solutions, our varied software offerings include the One Voice Operations Center, or OVOC,\nfor network and device configuration, monitoring and management, the Device Manager for administering business phones and meeting\nroom solutions, and the AudioCodes Routing Manager, or ARM, for handling call routing in complex VoIP networks. In addition, the\nUser Management Pack™ 365 simplifies user lifecycle and identity management across Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business\ndeployments.\nToday, we supply end-to-end solutions for the enterprise, contact center and service provider markets, with a strong focus on\naccelerating the voice-enablement of Microsoft Teams. These solutions include AudioCodes Live for Microsoft Teams, a flexible\nportfolio of fully managed services for simplifying Teams adoption.\nAcquisitions have played a key role in our development and growth strategy. For example, in 2004 we entered the field of call\nrecording when we acquired Ai-Logix, a leading provider of advanced voice recording technology and integration cards for the call\nrecording and voice/data logging industries. In 2015, we acquired Active Communications Europe to further strengthen our ability to\nprovide advanced software solutions for the then emerging Microsoft Skype for Business online application, including CloudBond 365\nand User Management Pack™ 365. In 2021, we acquired Callverso Ltd., a company with conversational AI solutions. Callverso was\nsubsequently merged into AudioCodes.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1 Hayarden Street, Airport City, Lod, 7019900 Israel. Our registration number\nwith the Israeli Registrar of Companies is 520044132. Our telephone number is +972-3-976-4099.

It ensures\ndata segregation and localization, with options for customers to bring their own media storage. Developed with Data privacy and Security\nby Design, including adherence to GDPR compliance and encryption.\nAs a result of the shift to Teams and the Work-from-Home model, we see many more customers wanting to record video to\nmeet their compliance requirements and to share the recorded content internally to drive collaboration and productivity improvements.\nVoca CIC\nAudioCodes Voca CIC is a one-screen contact center with built-in conversational AI that is also a certified Microsoft Teams\ncontact center solution.\nWith Voca as a Native Microsoft Teams application, one can consolidate the unified communications and contact center into\none screen, allowing every Microsoft Teams user to become a potential agent enabling real-time access to back-office experts to help\nimprove responsiveness, remove department silos, and improve connection among employees, while offering a unique mix of contact\ncenter and voice expertise.\nVoca CIC’s conversational capabilities include a drag-and-drop flow designer, dedicated worker (agent) and supervisor user\ninterface, CRM integration, skill-based routing, behavioral routing, real-time dashboards and historical analytics.\nVoca CIC can integrate (i.e., when connected via a VoIP gateway or SBC) with any PBX, contact center, or unified\ncommunications platform, enabling customers to access the contact center, IVR, auto-attendant and call queues in one centralized\nsystem, whether for single or multi organizations or multi-tenant application, serving both providers and multi-site organizations having\nmultiple voice platforms in parallel.\nDuring 2023, Voca CIC added multiple capabilities, including: agent and supervisor experience, CRM integration, enhanced\nreporting functionality, real-time back-office phonebook and UX improvements.\nVoice.AI Connect\nThe AudioCodes Voice.AI Connect Enterprise Edition extends chat and voice bot functionality to telephony communications,\nby connecting the bots to any type of telephony channel and thus allowing customers to talk naturally with bots for a voice-centric user\nexperience. Voice.AI Connect supports multiple bot use cases, including conversational IVR (replacing DTMF-based legacy IVR\nsystems), Virtual agent (offloading live agents), Agent assist (virtual assistant for live agents) and outbound campaign (calls initiated by\nthe bot).\nDuring 2022, we enhanced the integration with leading bot frameworks, including Microsoft PVA, Google Dialogflow and\nAmazon Lex and exposed APIs for voice streaming and fetching information such as call transcription.\nThe AudioCodes Live Hub is a self-service portal in which the bot developer can immediately connect the bot to Telephony\nSystems (e.g., SIP Trunks and Contact Centers), to be able to call and speak with a bot in just a few clicks.\nDuring 2023, we further expanded the capabilities of Live Hub to non-bot use cases. A notable development included support\nfor Teams Direct Route connectivity and user management. We also added support for Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Genesys Cloud\nContact Centers. With respect to bot connectivity, we additionally added support for Microsoft Co-Pilot Studio and Amazon Lex. Live\nHub customers can now also connect to their own Speech providers (TTS and STT). These new capabilities enhance Live Hub as a\nconnectivity and orchestration cloud solution for enterprise voice communication services.\n- 37 -\nVICA\nVICA is an Intelligent Virtual agent for contact centers that enhances customer experience while reducing operating costs.\nMeeting Insights\nMeeting Insights is an AI-powered enterprise solution that enables users to record any meeting generated content (audio and\nvideo), and automatically creates meeting minutes for Microsoft Teams meetings. It provides a centralized company platform for all\nmeeting recordings, webinars and conference calls, making them readily shareable across the organization.\nMeeting Insights was integrated with Azure Open AI GPT model to automatically analyze meeting recordings and to generate,\namong other things, summaries, list of action items, Issues & Solutions, Questions & Answers and Meeting outlines. In addition, a new\npure SaaS, multi-tenant, platform was built in 2023 to host the Meeting Insights application that offers seamless updates, scalable\narchitecture, and tailored feature deployment per tenant. It ensures data segregation and localization, with options for customers to bring\ntheir own media storage. Meeting Insights has been developed with data privacy and Security by Design, including adherence to GDPR\ncompliance and encryption.\nProduct and Technology Developments\nSBC Developments\nDuring 2023, we continued to enhance our SBCs’ security, capacity and resiliency in virtual and public cloud environments.\nWe also added video support for our WebRTC Gateway for Click-to-Call use case.\nIP Phones and Meeting Room Solutions\nDuring 2022 and 2023, we continued developing our range of IP phone devices and Room Experience, or RX, meeting room\nsuite offering for Microsoft Teams environments. The advent of COVID-19 and the resulting global switch to working from home, or\nWFH, played a significant role in adapting our strategy to suit the “new normal”, leading to the introduction of high-quality video\nsolutions for Teams meetings.\nWith increasing demand for video support in Teams meetings, we launched a new video collaboration bar designed for\nMicrosoft Teams, enabling customers to add high-quality video in huddle rooms and small meeting spaces. We introduced a broad set\nof RX video devices and solutions enabling us to offer video solutions suitable for all room sizes from huddle rooms up to large\nconference rooms.\nAs WFH and remote meetings became more prevalent, we also introduced a range of attractively priced personal audio and\nvideo solution bundles comprising a high-quality personal camera and one of our native Teams phones. Our native Teams phones include\na low-cost device, a touch-screen phone with a reduced footprint and an executive model complete with expansion module.\nManagement Solutions\nDuring 2022, we focused on developing functionalities for AudioCodes Live and Live Cloud. In particular, we developed\nonboarding, reporting and tools for our professional services to be able to provide managed services.\nWe also began developing a microservices holistic architecture to be used by OVOCaaS and our managed service platforms\n(live and Live Cloud).\nMoreover, we developed a generic analytics platform based on Azure synapse capabilities. The new generic analytics platform\ncan provide insights and predications based on MS teams call information integrated w/ SBC and MGW quality of services information.\nMoreover, the system analyzes the alarms to be used for fault predictions.\n- 38 -\nTo combat the growing issue of spamming and robocalls, which constitutes a growing problem in public networks, ARM now\noffers security-based routing as part of the integration with SecureLogix’s Orchestra One™ CAS (Call Authentication Service). In\naddition to the already-supported basic authentication with Orchestra One server, ARM now has an advanced mode which verifies calls\nwith Verizon Call Verification Service.

In 2023 we also made capital expenditures in connection with our new production facility. The table below sets\nforth our principal capital expenditures incurred for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands):\nYea r E nd ed Decemb er 3 1 ,\n2023 2022 2021\nComputers and peripheral equipment $ 2,462 $ 1,015 $ 592\nOffice furniture and equipment 737 281 546\nLeasehold improvements 5,572 191 36\nTotal $ 8,771 $ 1,487 $ 1,174\n- 39 -\nB. BUSINESS OVERVIEW\nINDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND MARKET TRENDS\nImpact of Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Trends on Our Markets\nAs global economies emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and endeavored to return to normality, the markets in which we operate\nwere impacted by other macroeconomic and geopolitical matters, including the following:\nChange in Working Practices – during the COVID-19 pandemic, the desire for a remote working environment accelerated and expanded\nrapidly, fueling the need for technologies to facilitate effective home-working and to help organizations maintain employee productivity.\nAs economies gradually returned to a form of normality, more organizations adopted Hybrid Working practices, with a blend of office\nand remote working. This saw an increase in global demand for room collaboration technologies to effectively and securely connect\noffice and remote workers for more productive meetings.\nInflationary Pressures Impacting Technology Consumption Models – in many global markets, inflationary pressures resulted in rising\ninterest rates, impacting demand for borrowing to fund capital expense projects. As a result, more organizations sought to deploy\ntechnology on a “pay per use” subscription model, leveraging advances in cloud-based technologies (such as Unified Communications\nas a Service and Contact Center as a Service). See Item 3.D, “Key Information – Risk Factors – High rates of global inflation and the\noccurrence of a recession could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”\nIncreased Geopolitical Uncertainty and Tensions – there was an increase in global geopolitical uncertainty during 2023. The ongoing\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine continued to cause economic challenges and inertia, especially in Europe. On October 7, 2023 the\nHamas terror attack on Israel led to a subsequent and ongoing conflict, impacting AudioCodes’ resources (such as R&D) and the\neconomy in Israel more broadly, and resulting in supply chain challenges in the Red Sea, a key global shipping route. See Item 3.D,\n“Key Information – Risk Factors – The attack on Israel in October 2023, and the ensuing war with the Hamas terror organization and\nrelated conflicts with their supporters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and\ncash flows.”\nThe Emergence of AI – AI evolved from a potential and theoretical future technology to a requirement now being demanded by many\norganizations in order to help them improve employee productivity and enhance their customer engagement experience, including\nthrough intelligent automation, natural language understanding and integration with other IT frameworks. Applications emerged for the\npractical use of AI, including recording meetings as a key source of business intelligence, connecting chatbots to voice and simplifying\nthe automation of customer journeys through a contact center. This rapidly growing and evolving trend to adopt AI as a core business\ncommunications tool is likely to continue in the near-term. See Item 3.D, “Key Information – Risk Factors – Our results of operations\ncould be materially and adversely affected if we cannot keep pace with technological changes impacting the development of our products\nand implementation of our business needs, including with respect to automation and the use of AI.”\nEnterprise Unified Communications\nIn 2023, the demand for cloud UC services continued to grow, albeit at slower rates as compared to during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwhile businesses continue to migrate their communications to the cloud, and continued slowdown of on-premises UC and the PBX\nmarket. UC functions are easily deployed through cloud services, along with access to continual updates and improvements and with\nnative support for work-from-anywhere.\nThe shift to cloud-based UC or uCaaS has been driven by companies like Microsoft, Zoom and Cisco.\n- 40 -\nContact Centers and Customer Service\nThe contact center is rapidly evolving into the interaction hub of the digital enterprise, covering sales, support, education and more. It\nencompasses all aspects of the customer experience, while gathering data on customer satisfaction and needs. Although the migration\nof contact center technologies to the cloud will deliver far more flexibility and enable support for service delivery anywhere, and on any\navailable media, many enterprises are retaining their existing (usually on-premises) systems to avoid the high costs involved in such a\nchange. In such cases, companies are looking to introduce innovation to their existing contact center platform.\nIn 2023, contact centers continued to adapt to allowing their agents to work from home. In parallel, the on-going growth in online\nconsumer services drove expansion in many contact centers as they adapted to the dramatic changes wrought by the pandemic. This\nrequired high numbers of agents working remotely, while customers were offered omnichannel engagement, enabling customers to get\nin touch not just by phone but also via the internet or dedicated mobile applications.\nAnother key driver that continued into 2023 was contact center automation. We saw increased interest in virtual agents, conversational\nIVR and virtual agent assistants in this market as enterprises sought cost optimization through increasing live agent productivity and\nautomation of the customer engagement while retaining and improving the customer experience.\nCloud and AI Driven Convergence of Unified Communications and Contact Center Markets\nWhile Unified Communications (UC) and Contact Center (CC) markets have unique attributes and trends, the broader IT trend\ntowards deploying cloud-based applications and services, plus the emergence of conversational AI, are accelerating the convergence of\nUC and CC technologies. As more enterprises adopt cloud-based platforms, such as Microsoft Teams, for collaboration and\ncommunication, they find that the same platform can also be used to deploy fully integrated Contact Center capabilities, with automation\nbenefits delivered by conversational AI applications. This convergence can drive cost-savings, reduce IT overhead to support both UC\nand CC, and enables enterprises to offer superior customer service via a single platform. In addition, as cloud-based services, these\ncombined UC and CC capabilities, along with AI, can be consumed as a service on a subscription basis, reducing the need for capital\nexpense and enabling the enterprise to scale users up and down as required during peak periods.\nService Provider All-IP Transition\nIn 2021 and for portions of 2022, we observed several telecom operators slowing down deployments due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, during the second half of 2022 and through 2023, several of our service provider customers began to resume deployment and\npressed ahead and completed their business customer migrations. In countries where the migration was completed, smaller tier 2 and\ntier 3 service providers expedited their ISDN contract cancellation following the incumbent’s switch to all-IP. In the UK, we saw a\npickup in migration pace, moving towards PSTN shutdown in 2025. Among the factors that have caused telecom operators to replace\nlegacy networks are the traditional TDM switches reaching end-of-life, the need to free-up the real estate occupied by these switches,\nenergy savings and the importance of competing with the growing numbers of alternative service providers.\nService providers typically apply two strategies for the business sector in the move towards all-IP networks. The first strategy is\ndeploying customer premises equipment (CPE) – such as VoIP media gateways, session border controllers or multi-service business\nrouters – to connect the customers’ legacy or IP systems to their own IP networks. The second strategy is seeking to aggregate a large\nnumber of TDM links, primarily ISDN PRI, at centralized points of presence utilizing high-capacity VoIP media gateways.\nDuring 2023, we also observed an increase in the need for speed to CPEs, driving the need to support Fiber connectivity (up to 1GB),\nas well as 4G LTE (up to 300MB) and upcoming 5G. The Work From Home activity drives integration of such interfaces in our lower-\nend CPEs.\n- 41 -\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nAudioCodes’ business strategy is focused on increasing its position as a leading communications software vendor of advanced UC and\ncontact center voice solutions and services, voice networking, all-IP voice network migration and Voice.AI solutions for the digital\nworkplace. The following are key elements of our strategy:\nMaintain and extend technological leadership. AudioCodes is recognized as a global leader in voice technologies. We intend to continue\nto capitalize on our voice expertise to drive new business opportunities, including through the application of AI, to add value to the\nemployee and customer experience. We continually seek to upgrade our product lines with additional functionalities, interfaces,\ndensities and compatibility with the leading UC, CC and SIP solutions in the market, providing agnostic voice and AI expertise to multi-\nvendor platforms. Our voice solutions have evolved to be software-based and run natively in cloud environments, to comply with the\nindustry trend of migrating to private and public clouds. We continue to invest heavily in putting voice and AI at the forefront of\ntechnological evolution in our industry.\nStrengthen and expand strategic relationships with key partners and customers. We sell our products and solutions to service providers\nand enterprises worldwide, leading enterprise channels, regional and global system integrators, global equipment manufacturers and\nVARs, in the telecommunications and networking industries and establish and maintain long-term working relationships with them. We\nwork closely with our customers to deliver products, solutions and services that meet their specific needs. The ongoing development and\nintegration cycles frequently result in close working relationships with our customers and partners. By focusing on leading solution\nvendors, system integrators and channels with large volume potential, we believe that we reach a substantial segment of our potential\ncustomer base while controlling the cost and complexity of our marketing efforts. Our partners and customers are located around the\nworld, and we are better able to serve them by being close by. For this reason, we are investing in building local operations in key\ncountries and regions, including sales, marketing and support resources, to closely serve our partners and customers.\nDevelop a network of strategic solution partners. We sell our products through, or in cooperation with, partners that can offer or certify\nour products as part of a complete solution to their customers. We expect to further develop our strategic partner relationships with\nsolution providers in order to increase our customer base. Our strategic partners include companies such as Microsoft, Zoom and\nGenesys.\nEngage enterprise customers in direct touch sales effort. We are pursuing a strategy of engaging large enterprise customers on a global\nlevel, as part of the AudioCodes product fit within leading enterprise solutions, mainly with Microsoft and Genesys. Our ability to\nengage with these enterprises directly enhances our ability to influence solution design and procurement decisions. This, in turn, is\ndesigned to increase demand, which we expect our business partners to fulfill based on their relationship with AudioCodes and the\nenterprise customers.\nExpand and enhance the development of highly integrated products and services. We plan to continue designing, developing and\nintroducing new product lines, product features and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers while\nadditionally helping them leverage new technologies (such as AI). We believe that our knowledge of core technologies and our ability\nto combine them in the form of integrated cloud services enables us to offer better solutions that (i) are more comprehensive, (ii) are\neasier to consume (via subscription) and (iii) contain more features than those available in competitive alternatives. For example, the\nnew AudioCodes Live Platform for Microsoft Teams offers integrated voice connectivity, contact center, recording, analytics and\nconversational IVR, all via a single subscription-based service. We believe there are notable growth opportunities for our development\nand profitability with respect to the offering of a broad range of highly integrated services that leverage our voice expertise with AI and\ndrive the convergence of unified communications and contact center as a service for our enterprise customers.\nExpand and enhance our solution offering. While the market is constantly looking for advanced, open communications and collaboration\nsolutions, integration of multi-vendor products into a working solution is a complex task that enterprises, system integrators, service\nand cloud providers are challenged with. Over the years, we have developed a broad portfolio of products and invested in lifecycle\nmanagement platforms (day 1 and day 2 operations) for our products that form a comprehensive solution, considerably simplifying the\nintegration efforts required for setting up working unified communications, contact center or hosted business solutions. Customers and\npartners realize and appreciate the advantages our solutions offer, and we plan to keep expanding them with more products,\nmanagement applications and enterprise productivity solutions.\n- 42 -\nBuild upon existing technologies to penetrate new markets, such as Contact Center. We are building on our expertise in voice and\nconversational AI to penetrate new markets—a notable example of this is the Contact Center market for Microsoft Teams. AudioCodes\nalready has an unrivalled portfolio of voice connectivity, recording, devices and management solutions/services for Microsoft Teams.\nWith Voca CIC, we now have a certified Microsoft Teams Contact Center built on Azure, which allows us to enter the market as a fully-\nfledged contact center vendor, as opposed to solely an enabler of third-party contact center capabilities. This is a new and potentially\nhigh-growth market segment for AudioCodes that can seek to leverage our existing strength and reseller community within the Microsoft\nTeams ecosystem, which continues to grow as Microsoft increasingly dominates the enterprise collaboration marketplace.\nDevelop and expand professional services and managed services offering. We continue to expand our product-led services offering in\nline with our new products and solutions across voice, conversational AI and contact center categories. AudioCodes has a rich portfolio\nof managed services. We offer our customers expert professional services to assist them with design, implementation, support and\nmanagement of our products. System integrators, VARs and service providers are able to leverage AudioCodes professional and\nmanaged services to complement their own, and are able to offer them under their own brand to the end customers.\nExpand our investments in conversational AI. As AI emerges as a key business tool, AudioCodes is investing heavily in\nconversational AI to deliver practical benefits that leverage the combination of AI and our deep voice expertise to deliver unique benefits\nthat improve both the employee and customer experience. From automated recording and analytics of meetings to improve business\nintelligence and productivity, to compliant interaction recording and AI automation that simplifies the customer journey and improves\ncustomer service, AudioCodes is committed to helping enterprises gain practical benefits from AI. The applications and services that\nwe deliver leveraging AI will seek to provide beneficial upsell and cross-sell opportunities to add value to, and extend our relationship\nwith, our global customer base.\nAcquire complementary businesses and technologies. We may pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies or\nthe establishment of joint ventures to broaden our product offerings, enhance the features and functionality of our systems, increase our\npenetration in targeted markets and expand our marketing and distribution capabilities.\nAUDIOCODES SOLUTIONS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nSolutions\nEnterprise Business\nUnified Communications\nOur enterprise business is driven primarily by our solutions for UC environments. Beginning in 2020, we noted a clear shift\ntowards uCaaS solutions as enterprises continue to migrate their IT infrastructure, in general, and UC solutions, in particular, to the\ncloud. We expect such trend to continue in 2024 and beyond, and consequently we plan to (x) focus on providing services and\napplications that add value to the uCaaS solutions, and (y) ensure a smooth migration to cloud-based UC while offering operational\nsimplicity, high quality and reliability.\nOur efforts in the uCaaS arena are focused on a number of key partnerships, predominantly with Microsoft, who reported\nsubstantial growth in the active users of their Teams UC and collaboration solution from 2020 through 2023. We expect our certified\nsupport for Teams Direct Routing, our communications solutions (Voca Conversational Interaction Center, call recording and Meeting\nInsights productivity solution), and our growing offering of audio and video devices and meeting room solutions to continue to be focus\nareas for us as enterprises migrate to Microsoft Teams Phone.\nWe anticipate that our AudioCodes Live for Microsoft Teams offering will continue to gain traction as enterprises look to\nstreamline their UC operations. Consumed on a monthly subscription basis, AudioCodes Live for Microsoft Teams enables enterprises\nto benefit from Teams voice calling services and add-on applications without having to make capital investments in hardware and\nsoftware, and without the need for specialized, in-house technical expertise.\nIn addition to Microsoft Teams, we also sought to strengthen and build on our collaborations with Zoom Phone and Cisco\nWebex.\n- 43 -\nContact Centers\nThe contact center industry is accelerating migration from on-premises to cloud-based Contact Center as a Service, or CcaaS.\nAudioCodes helps enterprises to migrate and modernizes their voice infrastructure to the cloud, especially when such enterprises use a\nlarge and distributed Contact Center. We are providing voice managed services that complement the cCaaS OPEX model.\nVoice.AI Business Line\nIn the last few years, dramatic leaps forward in machine learning and AI have driven a revolution in the way enterprises boost\nengagement with their customers. These significant advances mean that businesses can now utilize conversational AI technologies\noffered by various providers to automate their customer service departments and train bots to give callers a high level of service whenever\nthey get in touch. As voice is the most fundamental and intuitive method of conversation, we are focusing on enabling engagement of\nvoice and telephony to various AI-based applications and implementing voice-based use cases, leveraging on the investment made in\nAI and voice applications. We began investing in these applications in 2018 and we believe opportunities will develop across various\nproducts. Accordingly, we anticipate that these applications will become a new growth engine for our business in the near- and long-\nterm.\nService Provider Business\nIn the service provider market, our go-to-market strategy concentrates on outreach to small and medium sized businesses\n(SOHO, SMB, SME) with our VoIP gateways, SBCs and routers. We engage directly with service providers worldwide and supply\nthem with our versatile range of products to suit different business scenarios. This includes the ability to enable Microsoft Teams voice\nconnectivity through the Direct Routing feature, which allows companies to connect on-premises IP-PBX and UC platforms to the\ncloud-based Teams service.\nOn top of the direct routing, we also give SP the option to onboard their customers themselves using our live platform\napplications such as VOCA CIC, SmartTAP and meeting insights.\nFor service providers, we offer a certified Operator Connect accelerate platform, enabling operators to connect a certified\noperator within the Microsoft OC marketplace.

Contact Center capabilities are powered by Microsoft Azure Communication Services, with conversational AI\nbased on Microsoft Cognitive Services.\nVoice.AI Connect\nAudioCodes Voice.AI Connect extends chat and voice bot functionality to telephony communications by connecting bots to\nany type of telephony channel, thus enabling customers to speak naturally with bots for a voice-centric user experience. We work\nprimarily with bot framework vendors to enable and promote the creation of voice-bots by adding voice and telephony functionality to\ntheir bot framework platforms. We recurrently extend the supported bot frameworks, including Microsoft Co-pilot Studio and others, to\nenable multiple conversational AI use cases, such as Virtual Agents, Agent Assist and Conversational IVR.\nWe also initiated collaborations with a wide variety of market players, such as speech services providers, bot developers, system\nintegrators and advisors. We intend to leverage these alliances to create voice-bot opportunities for us, especially in the contact center\ndomain.\n- 45 -\nThe Live Hub that started as a self-service SaaS version, or Voice.AI Connect Enterprise, expanded to become a central cloud\nhub for connecting and orchestrating multiple enterprise voice communication services, including Bring-Your-Own-Carrier for contact\ncenters and direct route for Teams, and serves as a primary tool for exposing the bot development ecosystem to a wide array of voice-\nbot use cases via trials and proof of concept projects up to live productions. Live Hub is being marketed towards smaller customers with\nsimple setups that do not need customization.\nMeeting Insights\nMeeting Insights is an AI-powered enterprise solution that enables users to record any meeting generated content (audio and\nvideo), and automatically creates meeting minutes for Microsoft Teams meetings. It provides a centralized company platform for all\nmeeting recordings, webinars and conference calls, making them more readily shareable across the organization.\nMeeting Insights was integrated with Azure Open AI GPT model to automatically analyze meeting recordings and to generate,\namong other things, summaries, list of action items, Issues & Solutions, Questions & Answers and Meeting outlines. In addition, a new\npure SaaS, multi-tenant, platform was built in 2023 to host the Meeting Insights application that offers seamless updates, scalable\narchitecture, and tailored feature deployment per tenant. It ensures data segregation and localization, with options for customers to bring\ntheir own media storage. Meeting Insights has been developed with data privacy and Security by Design, including adherence to GDPR\ncompliance and encryption.\nManagement and Operations\nAudioCodes’ management and operational tools are designed for deployment within large-scale cloud or premises-based UC\ndeployments. They enable the management, monitoring and operation of the entire AudioCodes portfolio, including SBCs, media\ngateways, Microsoft-specific appliances and IP phones.\nOVOC is a voice network management solution that combines management of voice network devices and quality of experience\nmonitoring into a single, intuitive web-based application. OVOC enables administrators to adopt a holistic approach to network lifecycle\nmanagement by simplifying everyday tasks and assisting in troubleshooting all the way from detection to correction. OVOC’s clear GUI\ndesign allows administrators to manage the full lifecycle of VoIP devices and elements from a single centralized location, saving time\nand costs.\nAudioCodes’ Device Manager is a powerful and intuitive lifecycle management tool for enterprise IP phone deployments that\nenables administrators to deliver a reliable desktop phone service within their organization.

Firstly, we look to obtain direct touch with\nenterprise end customers to generate opportunities for new business and upsell new solutions or services to existing customers. This\napproach enables us to better understand the challenges that our customers face and offer solutions best suited to solving those\nchallenges. Secondly, we engage with the channel community in all of our core markets, comprising service providers, managed service\nproviders, system integrators and ICT resellers. This channel engagement allows us to scale up our geographic and market coverage, as\nwell as reach more enterprise end customers through the channel community.\nWe select our partners based on our coverage needs and their ability to provide effective field sales, end-customer engagement,\nmarketing communications and technical support to our customers. Our channel strategy also reflects the buying strategies of many\nenterprise end customers that have established procurement relationships with their preferred channel, or that are obliged to purchase\nthrough specific channels based on regulatory, certification or framework purchasing agreements (for example in the public sector).\n- 47 -\nFor larger enterprise deployments, prospective customers and channels generally need to commit resources to test and evaluate\nour products as a “proof of concept” and integrate them into existing systems, networks and applications, or evaluate and adopt our\nprofessional services and managed services. As a result, our sales process is often subject to delays associated with approval processes\nthat typically accompany the design and testing of new technologies or the SLA’s and security/compliance aspects of our service\nportfolio. For these reasons, the sales cycle of our products and services to new customers are often lengthy, averaging approximately\nsix to twelve months after achieving a design win. This time may be further extended because of internal testing, field trials and requests\nfor the addition or customization of features. Increasingly however, the cloud-based IT strategies adopted by enterprises are simplifying\nand accelerating the deployment of unified communications or contact centers “as a service”. AudioCodes Live Platform is designed to\naccommodate this more agile and speedy deployment strategy.\nWe market our products in North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America and Israel through a sales force that directly manages\nchannel partners and that has direct touch engagement with end customers. We have invested notable resources in setting up local field\nsales forces to give us a strong presence in relevant markets.\nWe generally enter into non-exclusive sales representation/distribution agreements with channel partners in each of the major\ncountries in which we do business. Typical product agreements are for renewable 12-month terms or are terminable at will by us upon\n90 days’ notice, and do not commit the customer to inventory or to any minimum sales of our products to third parties. Some of our\ncustomers have the ability to return some of the products they have previously purchased and purchase more up-to-date models. To\nsupport the cloud-based “as a service” model increasingly deployed by our customers and channel partners, we also have subscription\nagreements, which typically run from 12 to 36 months, delivering reliable recurring revenue on a “per user per month” basis as an\nincreasing proportion of our business.\nAudioCodes continues to enhance its marketing efforts with a focus on activities that generate new leads and opportunities to\nsupport our sales team and channel partners in driving new business. An integrated marketing program comprising digital advertising,\ntradeshows, conferences, social media marketing and media engagement is designed to generate leads and provide a level of brand\ncredibility and awareness in our core markets, with a focus on two primary campaigns: (i) unified communications; and (ii) contact\ncenter. In addition, our field marketing resources also drive local channel co-marketing, recruitment and development activities.\nCustomers\nOur customers consist of enterprises (with direct and indirect relationships), service providers (with direct and indirect\nrelationships), and a small percentage of OEM customers.\nOur enterprise customers include a range of Fortune 1000 organizations, Public Sector organizations (central and local\ngovernment, healthcare and education) and smaller enterprises that use our equipment to primarily enable their UC or Contact Center\nsolutions. Our solutions are sold to enterprise customers through a wide network of resellers, integrators and distributors, and the bulk\nof our business is carried out in a two-tier model in over 100 countries. AudioCodes solutions and subscription services enable enterprises\nto smoothly migrate their communications infrastructure to cloud-based UC solutions that have emerged to dominate the market in\nrecent years, such as Microsoft Teams as well as cloud-based contact center as a service offerings. Our sales in this segment are based\non two major business offerings: (i) the traditional model, including equipment, maintenance contracts and, optionally, day-1\nprofessional services; and (ii) a full “as-a-service” solution or managed service that includes the equipment, maintenance, day-1 and\nday-2 professional services. The latter offering is generally growing year-on-year as a proportion of our revenues and promised recurring\nrevenues and profits over time.\nOur service provider customers include a range of tier 1, 2 and 3 service providers that deploy our solution as part of their\nvoice, UC, SIP trunk or other offerings for their business customers. Our solutions are deployed either at the customer's premises or at\nthe service provider core as a white-labelled cloud-based subscription service leveraging the AudioCodes Live Platform. Typically,\nthese services allow the service provider to provide their customers with voice connectivity and integration with UC platforms, such as\nMicrosoft Teams, Zoom Phone, Cisco Webex, contact center as a service, conversational AI recording and analytics. AudioCodes’ broad\nrange of products, broad functionality and wide interoperability allow service providers to deploy our solutions in practically any third-\nparty solution environment and for a wide range of customers. Our solutions have been sold to service provider customers in 100\ncountries.\n- 48 -\nAudioCodes’ OEM customers include vendors that leverage AudioCodes’ technology and quality to deliver VoIP products and\nsolutions. Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from OEM customers that sold our technology products as\npart of their own voice solutions.\nManufacturing\nSome of our components are obtained from single suppliers. For example, Texas Instruments Incorporated supplies all of our\nDSP components, while Motorola and Cavium Networks provide embedded CPU and network processors. Other components are generic\nin nature, and we believe they can be obtained from multiple suppliers.\nWe have not entered into any long-term supply agreements. However, we have worked for years in several countries with\nestablished global manufacturing leaders such as Flex and have had significant experience with their level of commitment and ability to\ndeliver. To date, we have been able to obtain sufficient amounts of these components to meet our needs and do not foresee any supply\ndifficulty in obtaining timely delivery of any parts or components. However, an interruption in supply from any of these sources,\nespecially with regard to DSP components from Texas Instruments Incorporated and CPU and network processors from both Cavium\nNetworks and Motorola, or an unexpected termination of the manufacture of certain electronic components, could disrupt production,\nthereby adversely affecting our results. We generally maintain an inventory of critical components used in the manufacture and assembly\nof our products although our inventory of signal processor chips would likely not be sufficient in the event that we had to engage an\nalternate supplier for these components.\nWe utilize contract manufacturing for virtually all our manufacturing processes. Most of our manufacturing is carried out by\nthird-party subcontractors in China and Israel. Our internal manufacturing activities consist primarily of the production of prototypes,\ntest engineering, materials purchasing and inspection, final product configuration and quality control and assurance.\nIn addition, we have engaged several ODMs based in Asia to design and manufacture some of our products. We may engage\nadditional ODMs in the future. Termination of our commercial relationship with an ODM or the discontinuance of manufacturing of\nproducts by an ODM would negatively affect our business operations.\nWe are obligated under certain agreements with our suppliers to purchase goods and to purchase excess inventory. Aggregate\nnon-cancellable obligations under these agreements as of December 31, 2023, were approximately $14 million.\nIndustry Standards and Government Regulations\nOur products must comply with industry standards relating to telecommunications equipment. Before completing sales in a country, our\nproducts must comply with local telecommunications standards, recommendations of quasi-regulatory authorities and recommendations\nof standards-setting committees. In addition, public carriers require that equipment connected to their networks comply with their own\nstandards. Telecommunication-related policies and regulations are continuously reviewed by governmental and industry standards-\nsetting organizations and are always subject to amendment or change. Although we believe that our products currently meet applicable\nindustry and government standards, we cannot be sure that our products will comply with future standards.\nWe are subject to telecommunication industry regulations and requirements set by telecommunication carriers that address a\nwide range of areas including quality, final testing, safety, packaging and use of environmentally friendly components. We comply with\nthe European Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (under certain exemptions) that requires telecommunication\nequipment suppliers to not use some materials that are not environmentally friendly. These materials include Cadmium, Hexavalent\nchromium, Lead, Mercury, Polybrominated biphenyls, Polybrominatel diphenyl ethers Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, benzyl butyl\nphthalate, Dibutyl phthalate and Diisobutyl phthalate We expect that other countries, including countries we operate in, will adopt\nsimilar directives or other additional directives and regulations.\n- 49 -\nCompetition\nCompetition in our industry is intense and we expect competition to increase in the future. Our competitors currently sell\nproducts that provide similar benefits to those that we sell. There has been a significant amount of merger and acquisition activity,\nfrequently involving major telecommunications equipment manufacturers acquiring smaller companies, as well as strategic alliances\nentered into by competitors. We expect that these activities will result in an increasing concentration of market share among these\ncompanies, many of whom are our customers. See Item 3.D, “Key Information – Risk Factors – The markets we serve are highly\ncompetitive and several of our competitors have competitive advantages over us, which may make it difficult for us to maintain\nprofitability.” The following sets forth a list of competing vendors and providers in each of our main product and service categories:\nNetworking Solutions\nIn the area of enterprise session border controllers, we compete with Oracle, Ribbon Communications, Metaswitch (acquired\nby Microsoft Azure for Operators), TE-Systems and Ingate.\nIn the area of low and mid-density digital gateways we face competition from companies such as Ribbon Communications,\nCisco, Dialogic, NewRock, Patton, Ferrari and Sangoma.\nOur competitors in the area of multi-service business routers are companies such as Cisco, Juniper, Adtran, One-Access\n(acquired by Ekinops), Patton, Huawei, HP/3COM and Alcatel-Lucent.\nApplications\nOur competitors in the area of call recording, compliance recording and convenient include companies such as Verint, NICE,\nACS, Red Box (acquired by Uniphore), Teleware and Dubber.\nOur competitors in the area of Conversational IVR, Speech Attendants include, but are not limited to, Nuance, Parlance and\nother contact center vendors which provide IVR solutions.\nOur competitors in the area of applications leveraging speech recognition and conversational AI technology include companies\nsuch as Twilio, Nuance (acquired by Microsoft) and IBM, as well as Contact Center vendors such as Genesys, NICE and Five9s. Some\npublic cloud providers offer technology and services that partially overlap with ours and several smaller startup companies are also\ndeveloping competing solutions.\nOur competitors in the area of contact center include, but are not limited to, Anywhere365, Luware, Landis, ComputerTalk and\nother contact center vendors, primarily focused on the Microsoft Teams product.\nOur competitors in the area of SmartTAP360 live, which focuses mainly on compliance and quality recording in conjunction\nwith Microsoft Teams, include, among others, ASC, Red Box (acquired by Uniphore), Dubber, CallCabinet, Numonix, NICE and Verint.\nSuch competitors are currently listed in the certified list of Microsoft vendors although we mainly see their presence in mid-market\nprojects.\nOur competitors in the area of Meeting Insights, which is focused on productivity enhancement, organization repository and\nsharing for meetings in the Microsoft Teams environment, include, but are not limited to, Avoma, Otter and Fireflies.AI.\nDevices\nOur principal competitors in the area of IP phones and meeting room devices are “best-of-breed” IP phone vendors and end-\nto-end IP telephony vendors. “Best of breed” IP phone vendors sell standards-based SIP phones that can be integrated into any standards-\nbased IP-PBX or hosted IP telephony system. These competitors include Poly (acquired by HPQ), Yealink, Grandstream, Logitech,\nCrestron, VTEC (which acquired Snom Technology) and many others.\n- 50 -\nAudioCodes Live for Microsoft Teams and CCaaS Managed Services\nOur main competitor in the area of Live is the in-house implementation of projects (after buying products either directly or\nthrough an integrator). Competition is also exhibited in the form of system integrators, such as Converge One, NTT and BT, among\nseveral others, in various sizes, locations and specialties.\nSome of our competitors have the ability to offer vendor-sponsored financing programs to customers. Those with broad product\nportfolios may also be able to offer lower prices on products that compete with ours because of their ability to recoup a loss of margin\nthrough sales of other products or services. Additionally, voice, audio and other communications alternatives that compete with our\nproducts are constantly being introduced.\nOur competitors in content delivery or connectivity platform, as well as Operator Connect Accelerate, Zoom exchange\nproviders and WebEx enablement, include: (i) SIPPIO; (ii) DSTNY Group; and (iii) Nuwave. Some of our competitors are also\ncustomers of our products and technologies.\nIn the future, we may also develop and introduce other products or services with new or additional telecommunications\ncapabilities or services. As a result, we may compete directly with VoIP companies, system integrators, VARs and other\ntelecommunications infrastructure and solution providers, some of which may be our current customers. Additional competitors may\ninclude companies that currently provide communication software products and services. The ability of some of our competitors to\nbundle other enhanced services or complete solutions with VoIP products could give these competitors an advantage over us.\nIntellectual Property and Proprietary Rights\nOur success is dependent in part upon proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright and\ntrade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary rights. We also rely on\ntrademark protection concerning various names and marks that serve to identify us and our products. While our ability to compete may\nbe affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that because of the rapid pace of technological change in our\nindustry maintaining our technological leadership and our comprehensive familiarity with all aspects of the technology contained in our\nsignal processors and communication boards is also significant to our success.\nWe own U.S. patents that relate to our technologies. We also actively pursue patent protection in selected other countries of\ninterest to us. In addition to patent protection, we seek to protect our proprietary rights through unregistered copyright protection and\nthrough restrictions on access to our trade secrets and other proprietary information which we impose through confidentiality agreements\nwith our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants.\n- 51 -\nThere are a number of companies besides us who hold or may acquire patents for various aspects of the technology incorporated\nin the ITU’s standards or other industry standards or proprietary standards, for example, in the fields of wireless and cable. While we\nhave obtained cross-licenses from some of the holders of these other patents, we have not obtained a license from all of the holders. The\nholders of these other patents from whom we have not obtained licenses may take the position that we are required to obtain a license\nfrom them. Companies that have submitted their technology to the ITU (and generally other industry standards making bodies) for\nadoption as an industry standard are required by the ITU to undertake to agree to provide licenses to that technology on reasonable\nterms. Accordingly, we believe that even if we were required to negotiate a license for the use of such technology, we would be able to\ndo so at an acceptable price. Similarly, third parties who also participate with respect to the same standards-setting organizations as do\nwe may be able to negotiate a license for use of our proprietary technology at a price acceptable to them, but which may be lower than\nthe price we would otherwise charge.\nThird parties have claimed, and from time to time in the future may claim, that our past, current or future products infringe\ntheir intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is complex and there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome of any\nlitigation. Any future intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in substantial expense to us and significant\ndiversion of the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Litigation could also disrupt or otherwise severely impact our\nrelationships with current and potential customers as well as our manufacturing, distribution and sales operations in countries where\nrelevant third-party rights are held and where we may be subject to jurisdiction. An adverse determination in any proceeding could\nsubject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from such parties, assuming licenses to such\nrights could be obtained, or require us to cease using such technology and expend significant resources to develop non-infringing\ntechnology. We may not be able to obtain a license at an acceptable price.\nIn the past, we have entered into technology licensing fee agreements with third parties. Under these agreements, we agreed to\npay these third parties royalties, based on sales of relevant products.\nC. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nAudioCodes Ltd. is the parent company of a group that consists of AudioCodes Ltd. and over 20 subsidiaries worldwide.\nAudioCodes Inc., our wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary incorporated in Delaware, is a significant subsidiary based in Piscataway, New\nJersey.\nD. PROPERTY, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT\nWe lease our main office and warehouse facilities, located in Airport City, Lod, Israel, which occupy approximately 274,000\nsquare feet for annual lease payments of approximately $6.5 million (including management fees). The term of this lease was extended\nuntil April 30, 2024. In November 2022, we entered into new lease agreement in Park Naimi, which is located near Messubim Junction\nin Israel, or the New Lease Agreement. The New Lease Agreement will replace the current lease agreement of our main offices in Israel.\nPursuant to the New Lease Agreement, we will lease from the landlord an approximately 10,000 square meters facility, or the Premises.\nThe lease of the Premises, which is still under construction, commenced during 2023. The initial lease term under the New Lease\nAgreement is for 7 years. Additionally, we hold options under the New Lease Agreement to extend the lease term for additional periods\nof five years.\nIn June 2023, we entered into a new lease agreement in Or Yehuda, or the Or Yehuda Lease, which commenced in 2023. The\nOr Yehuda Lease replaces the current lease agreement of our warehouse in Israel. Pursuant to the Or Yehuda Lease, we have leased\nfrom the landlord an approximately 1,128 square meter facility. The initial lease term under the Or Yehuda Lease is for six years,\ncommencing upon the transfer of possession of the Premises (as defined in the Or Yehuda Lease). We additionally hold options under\nthe Or Yehuda Lease to extend the lease term for additional periods of up to 10 years.\nWe also lease offices in Beer Sheva, Israel, or the Beer Sheva Lease. The annual lease payments in 2023 (including management\nfees) for Beer Sheva Lease was approximately $419,000.\n- 52 -\nOur U.S. subsidiary, AudioCodes Inc., leased an approximately 14,706 square foot facility in Piscataway, New Jersey, or the\nNew Jersey Lease, on May 13, 2022. AudioCodes Inc. also leases offices in Morrisville, North Carolina, or the North Carolina Lease.\nThe annual lease payments in 2023 (including management fees) for all our offices in the United States were approximately $467,000.\nWe lease additional offices in Israel as well as for our international offices; however, we do not believe the lease agreements\nfor these offices are material.\nWe believe that these properties are sufficient to meet our current needs. However, we may need to increase the size of our\ncurrent facilities, seek new facilities, close certain facilities or sublease portions of our existing facilities in order to address our needs\nin the future.\nITEM 4.A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates of America, or U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require management to make certain estimates, judgments and\nassumptions based upon information available at the time that they are made, historical experience and various other factors that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nperiods presented.\nOur management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our Audit Committee. See Note 2\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, which contains additional information regarding\nour accounting policies and other disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on\nhistorical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nManagement believes the significant accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation\nof its consolidated financial statements and are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating AudioCodes’ reported\nfinancial results include the following:\n• Revenue recognition and allowance for sales returns;\n• Allowance for credit losses;\n• Inventories;\n• Intangible assets;\n• Goodwill;\n• Income taxes and valuation allowance;\n• Share-based compensation; and\n• Contingent liabilities.\n- 53 -\nThe extent of the impact of current macroeconomic conditions, including, but not limited to, rising inflation, an overall global\neconomic slowdown and the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East, on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain at this time. Accordingly, we face a greater degree of\nuncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply certain of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Sales Returns\nWe generate our revenues primarily from the sale of software licenses, equipment, and related services through a direct sales\nforce and sales representatives. Our products are delivered to our customers, which include original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs,\nnetwork equipment providers, systems integrators, enterprises, carriers and distributors in the telecommunications and networking\nindustries, all of whom are considered end-users.\nRevenues are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, “Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers”. As such, we identify a contract with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the\ntransaction price, allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract and recognize revenues when (or as) we\nsatisfy its performance obligations.\nWe enter into contracts that can include combinations of products and services that are capable of being distinct and accounted\nfor as separate performance obligations. The software licenses and equipment are distinct as the customer can derive the economic\nbenefit of it without any additional services. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation, based on its relative\nstandalone selling price out of the total consideration of the contract.\nSoftware license and equipment revenues are recognized at the point of time when control is transferred, the product has been\ndelivered and the benefit of the asset has been transferred.\nRevenues from maintenance and support services are recognized over time ratably over the term of the contract.\nWe enter into contracts that included combinations of products and services that are capable of being distinct and accounted\nfor as separate performance obligations. The software licenses and equipment are distinct as the customer can derive the economic\nbenefit of it without any additional services. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation, based on its relative\nstandalone selling price out of the total consideration of the contract.\nAs we generally do not sell the products separately on a standalone basis, the standalone selling prices are not directly\nobservable. Therefore, we make estimates, based on reasonably available information. The estimated selling price is established\nconsidering multiple factors such as historical selling prices, internal pricing practices, gross margin objectives and discount policy.\nWe grant to certain customers a right of return or the ability over a limited period to exchange for other products a specific\npercentage of the total price paid for products they have purchased. We maintain a provision for product returns and exchanges and\nother incentives, based on our experience with historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors, all in\naccordance with ASC 606. This provision is deducted from revenues and amounted to approximately $2.1 million and $2.7 million as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This provision was recorded as part of other payables and accrued expenses.\nIn instances of contracts where revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company generally determined\nthat those contracts do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of the invoicing terms is to provide customers\nwith simplified and predictable ways of purchasing the Company's products and services, not to receive or provide financing. We use\nthe practical expedient and does not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment\nand revenue recognition is a year or less.\nDeferred revenues include amounts invoiced to customers for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Deferred revenues\nare recognized as (or when) we perform the performance obligations under the contract.\n- 54 -\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur trade receivables are derived from sales to customers located primarily in the Americas, the Eastern Asia, Israel and Europe.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and to date have not experienced any material losses from uncollected\nreceivables. our expected allowance for credit losses for trade receivables is based upon its assessment of various factors, including\nhistorical experience, the age of the trade receivable balances, credit quality of its customers, current economic conditions and other\nfactors. We usually do not require collateral on trade receivables because most of our sales are made to large and well-established\ncompanies. On occasion we may purchase credit insurance to cover credit exposure for a portion of our sales and this may mitigate the\namount we need to write off as a result of doubtful collections.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined using the “weighted average cost” method for raw materials\nand finished products. We periodically evaluate the quantities on hand relative to current and historical selling prices and historical and\nprojected sales volume and technological obsolescence. Based on these evaluations, inventory write-offs are provided to cover risks\narising from slow-moving items, technological obsolescence, excess inventories, discontinued product lines and market prices lower\nthan cost. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we wrote off inventory in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.1 million,\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022, inventory write off was immaterial, and during the year ended December 31, 2021, we wrote\noff inventory in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.7 million.\nIntangible Assets\nAs a result of our acquisitions, our balance sheet included acquired intangible assets in the aggregate amount of approximately\n$1.0 million and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe allocated the purchase price of the companies we acquired to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include future expected cash flows from\ntechnology acquired, trade names, backlog and customer relationships. In addition, other factors considered are the brand awareness and\nmarket position of the products sold by the acquired companies and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be\nused in the combined company’s product portfolio. Management’s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but such assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nIf we did not appropriately allocate these components or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of these components, our\ncomputation of amortization expense may not appropriately reflect the actual impact of these costs over future periods, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our operating results.\nIntangible assets are comprised of acquired technology, customer relations and licenses. Intangible assets that are not\nconsidered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized using the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from\nfour to ten years. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted\nfuture cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is\nmeasured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired assets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, no impairment charges were identified.\nGoodwill\nAs a result of our acquisitions, our balance sheet included acquired goodwill in the aggregate amount of approximately $37.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of\nnet tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired and accounted for under the purchase method. In accordance with\nASC 350, “Intangible, Goodwill and Other,” goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually. Our annual\nimpairment test is performed at the end of the fourth quarter each year. If events or indicators of impairment occur between the annual\nimpairment tests, we perform an impairment test of goodwill at that date.\n- 55 -\nASC 350, prescribes a two-phase process for impairment testing of goodwill. The first phase screens for impairment, while the\nsecond phase (if necessary) measures impairment. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit\nexceeds its estimated fair value. In such case, the second phase is then performed, and we measure impairment by comparing the carrying\namount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal\nto the excess. We have an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two-step goodwill impairment test. If this is the case, the two-\nstep goodwill impairment test is required. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying\namount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, no impairment losses were identified with respect to intangible\nassets.\nIncome Taxes and Valuation Allowance\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax expense\nin each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure, which is accrued\nas taxes payable, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting\npurposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We may record a\nvaluation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.\nAlthough we believe that our estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final tax outcome and the valuation\nallowance will not be different from those which are reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nWe have filed or are in the process of filing U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns and Israel tax returns, that might be\nsubject to audit by the respective tax authorities. Although the ultimate outcome is unknown, we believe that adequate amounts have\nbeen provided for and any adjustments that may result from tax return audits are not likely to materially adversely affect our consolidated\nresults of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nShare-based Compensation\nWe account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”. We utilize\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes\nmodel requires subjective assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected life of options and risk-free interest rates.\nThese assumptions reflect management’s best estimates. Changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the estimate of\nfair value and the amount of our share-based compensation expenses relating to stock options. We recognized share-based compensation\nexpense of $11.4 million, $15.1 million and $14.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there was approximately $10.7 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-\nvested share-based compensation arrangements granted by us. As of December 31, 2023, such expense is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted-average period of 2.68 years.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe are, from time to time, involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other proceedings arising from the\nordinary course of our business. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been\nincurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. Such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our\ncontrol. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our\nresults of operations, financial position and cash flows. No provision was recorded as of December 31, 2023.\n- 56 -\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nNot applicable.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nSee Note 2ab to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nA.

We have other offices located in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Australia.\n- 57 -\nHistorically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from large purchases by a limited number of OEMs, NEPs, systems\nintegrators and distributors. Westcon Group, our largest customer, accounted for approximately 16.3%, 15.1% and 15.4% of our\nrevenues in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, ScanSource Communications Group\naccounted for approximately 10.3%, 10.0% and 10.9%, of our revenues in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 39.2%, 38.2% and 38.7% of our revenues in the years ended December\n31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If we lose a large customer and fail to add new customers to replace the associated lost revenue,\nor the revenue derived from any such customers materially decreases, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nRevenues, based on the location of our customers for the last three fiscal years, are as follows:\nYea r E nded Decemb er 3 1,\n2023 2022 2021\nAmericas, principally the United States 51.7 % 50.7 % 46.5 %\nEastern Asia 14.5 15.3 15.7\nEurope 32.3 31.9 35.6\nIsrael 1.5 2.1 2.2\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nBeyond repeated business from distributors and service providers, we believe that prospective customers are generally required\nto make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our products and to integrate them into their larger systems. Our\nsales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of\nnew communications equipment. For these reasons, the sales cycles of our products to new customers are often lengthy, averaging\napproximately six to twelve months. As a result, we may incur significant selling and product development expenses prior to generating\nrevenues from sales.\nThe currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the dollar and, as such, we use\nthe dollar as our functional currency. Transactions and balances originally denominated in dollars are presented at their original amounts.\nAll transaction gains and losses from the premeasurement of monetary balance sheet items denominated in non-dollar currencies are\nreflected in the statement of operations as financial income or expenses, as appropriate.\nThe demand for VoIP technology has increased during recent years. In recent years, the shift from traditional circuit-switched\nnetworks to next generation packet-switched networks continued to gain momentum. As data traffic becomes the dominant factor in\ncommunications, service providers are building and maintaining converged networks for integrated voice and data services. In developed\ncountries, traditional and alternative service providers have adopted bundled triple play (voice, video and data) and quadruple play\n(voice, video, data and mobile) offerings. This trend, enabled by voice and multimedia over IP, has fueled competition among cable,\nwireline, ISP and mobile operators, increasing the pressure for adopting and deploying VoIP networks. In addition, underdeveloped\nmarkets without basic wire line service in countries such as China and India and certain countries in Eastern Europe are adopting the\nuse of VoIP technology to deliver voice and data services that were previously unavailable.\nThe general economic uncertainty, including disruptions in the world credit and equity markets, has had and continues to have\na negative impact on business around the world. This economic environment has had an adverse impact on the technology industry and\nour major customers. Conditions may continue to be uncertain or may be subject to deterioration which could lead to a reduction in\nconsumer and customer spending overall, which could have an adverse impact on sales of our products. A disruption in the ability of\nour significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could\nlead to a significant reduction in their orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations\nto us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. In addition, any disruption in the\nability of customers to access liquidity could lead customers to request longer payment terms from us or long-term financing of their\npurchases from us. Granting extended payment terms or a significant adverse change in a customer’s financial and/or credit position\ncould also require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or could limit our ability to collect receivables\nrelated to purchases by that customer. As a result, our allowance for credit losses and write-offs of accounts receivable could increase.\n- 58 -\nOngoing Conflict in Ukraine\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Russia and Ukraine continue to engage in active and\narmed conflict. Such conflict has resulted, and will likely continue to result in, significant destruction of Ukraine’s infrastructure and\nsubstantial casualties amongst military personnel and civilians. As a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the governments of several\nnations have implemented commercial and economic sanctions against Russia (as well as certain banks, companies, government\nofficials, and other individuals in Russia and Belarus). In addition to governmental entities, actors in the private sector, including, among\nothers, tech firms, consumer brands and major manufacturers, have stopped, or previously announced that they intend to stop, operations\nin Russia and cease their partnerships with Russian firms, and shippers, insurance companies and refiners have similarly indicated that\nthey will no longer purchase or ship crude oil from Russia. In March 2022, Israel’s then Foreign Minister Mr. Yair Lapid indicated that\nIsrael would not function as a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other western countries, and Israeli\nbanks have elected to sever relationships with sanctioned Russian banks. While Israel has not, as of the date of this Annual Report,\nimposed explicit sanctions on Russia or Belarus, it has publicly rejected Russia’s annexation of the four occupied regions of Ukraine\nand voiced support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Moreover, Israeli companies who hold ties to the United States,\nthe United Kingdom and the European Union could be indirectly subject to the measures imposed by such nations.\nIn May 2023, in coordination with the G7, Australia, and other partners, the United States imposed new sanctions on Russia.\nAs part of these actions, the U.S. Department of State imposed sanctions on over 200 entities, individuals, vessels, and aircraft, as well\nas designated certain entities and individuals (i) across Russia’s defense and related materiel, technology, and metals and mining sectors\nand (ii) involved in expanding Russia’s future energy production and capacity.\nIn December 2023, President Biden signed an executive order which seeks to strengthen U.S. sanctions authorities against\nfinancial facilitators of Russia’s war efforts, and additionally provided authority to broaden U.S. import bans on certain Russian goods.\nMoreover, in February 2024, the United States’ Treasury Department, State Department and Department of Commerce, collectively,\nimposed an extensive set of new sanctions on Russia, which specifically target Russia’s financial sector and military-industrial\noperations. Such sanctions seek to restrict Russia’s energy industry and limit the evasion of sanctions outside the United States, including\nby encompassing 500 additional persons associated with the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict.\nWhile it is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate consequences and impact of the conflict in Ukraine, such conflict\ncould result in, among other things, significant regional instability and geopolitical shifts, and material and adverse effects on global\nmacroeconomic conditions, financial markets, exchange rates and supply chains. To the extent negotiations between Russia and Ukraine\nare ultimately unsuccessful, the conflict in Ukraine could have a lasting impact in the near- and long-term on the financial condition,\nbusiness and operations of our business (and the businesses of the counterparties with whom we engage), and the global economy at\nlarge.\nOngoing War in Gaza and Regional Hostilities\nOn October 7, 2023, terrorists from Hamas and other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza\nStrip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets, including widespread killings and kidnappings. Shortly following\nthe attack, Israel declared war against Hamas. In addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued hostilities\nalong Israel’s northern border with Hamas supporters, including Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization) and Syria. The\naggressors have utilized, and could continue to use, terror, rocket and drone attacks, which target locations throughout Israel and cause\nsubstantial disruption and damage. Israel may not be able to defend effectively against such attacks and such attacks could have a\nmaterial and adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition. Additionally, the Houthi movement, which controls\nparts of Yemen, launched a number of rocket attacks targeting Israel’s southern border and attacks on marine vessels traversing the Red\nSea, which marine vessels were thought to either be in route towards Israel or to be partly owned by Israeli businessmen. It is possible\nthat these hostilities will escalate, and that other terrorist organizations, including the Palestinian military organizations in the West\nBank as well as other hostile countries, such as Iran, will join the hostilities.\n- 59 -\nIn 2023, sales to customers in Israel accounted for less than 1.5% of our total revenues. Our Israeli facilities are based in central\nIsrael, in an area that to date has seen minor disruptions from rocket attacks. To date, none of our facilities or infrastructure have been\ndamaged nor have our supply chains been significantly impacted since the war commenced in October 2023. However, we cannot\npredict the ultimate effect that the ongoing war and hostilities will have on us, including our supply chain and our ability to ship products\nfrom Israel, and any increase in these hostilities or any future armed conflict, political instability or violence in the region. Additionally,\nsome of our officers and employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty and are subject to being called for\nadditional active duty under emergency circumstances. For example, in connection with the war with Hamas and conflicts with its\nsupporters described above, some of our employees were called up to serve in the army. Some of our employees live within conflict\narea territories and may be forced to stay at home instead of reporting to work. If many of our employees are called for active duty, or\nforced to stay at home, our operations in Israel and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nA number of countries and organizations continue to restrict or ban business with Israel or with Israeli companies, or with\ncompanies doing business with Israel or with Israeli companies, which may limit our ability to make sales in those countries. The war\nwith Hamas and conflicts with its supporters have also led to a reduction in the number of airlines and flights to Israel as well as a threat\nto shipping lines. In addition, there have been increased efforts by activists to cause companies and consumers to boycott Israeli goods\nbased on Israeli government policies. Such actions, particularly if they become more widespread, may adversely impact our ability to\nsell our products. Moreover, any deterioration in the capital markets resulting directly or indirectly from the ongoing conflict could limit\nour ability to obtain external financing.\nWe cannot predict the full impact of the war with Hamas and the related conditions on us in the future, particularly if emergency\ncircumstances or geopolitical tensions continue, any aspect of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\nposition, operating results and cash flows. To the extent that the ongoing war with Hamas and conflicts with its supporters materially\nand adversely affects our business and financial results, such may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described\nin Item 3.D, “Key Information – Risk Factors.”\n- 60 -\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:\nY ear ended Dec e mber 31,\n2023 2022\n% of % of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues\nRevenues:\nProducts $ 123,991 50.7 % $ 164,302 59.7 %\nServices 120,392 49.3 110,791 40.3\nTotal revenues 244,383 100.0 275,093 100.0\nCost of revenues:\nProducts 47,964 19.6 63,686 23.1\nServices 38,070 15.6 32,629 11.9\nTotal cost of revenues 86,034 35.2 96,315 35.0\nGross profit 158,349 64.8 178,778 65.0\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development, net 57,169 23.4 59,842 21.8\nSelling and marketing 70,243 28.7 70,123 25.4\nGeneral and administrative 16,513 6.8 17,494 6.4\nTotal operating expenses 143,925 58.9 147,459 53.6\nOperating income 14,424 5.9 31,319 11.4\nFinancial income (expenses), net (52) - 2,864 1\nIncome before taxes on income 14,372 5.9 34,183 12.4\nTaxes on income (5,592) (2.3) (5,717) (2.1)\nNet income $ 8,780 3.6 % $ 28,466 10.3 %\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenues. Revenues decreased by 11.2% to $244.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, from $275.1 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\nOur revenues from sales of products in the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 24.5% to $124.0 million, or 50.7% of\ntotal revenues, from $164.3 million, or 59.7% of total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in revenues from\nsales of products was primarily attributable to the softness in our service provider segment, as carriers reduced inventories and purchases\nin light of elevated interest rate environment as well as slowing decision cycle from enterprises owing to uncertain macroeconomic\nbackdrop.\nOur revenues from sales of services in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 8.7% to $120.4 million, or 49.3% of\ntotal revenues, from $110.8 million, or 40.3% of total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in revenues from\nsales of services was primarily driven by the growth of our professional and managed services offerings. At the core of this growth is\nour continued progress in pivoting to recurring revenues with strong execution in our operation of the AudioCodes Live offering. The\ngrowth in product support services was attributable to sales of products in prior periods that resulted from an increase of our renewal\nrate of support agreements in some regions and from support services for a larger number of products being supported. The growth in\nsales of professional services was attributable to offering more managed services with larger contract value as part of our AudioCodes\nLive offering and a broader portfolio of professional services offered by us and an increase in demand for such services in the Enterprise\nUC market (mainly Microsoft Teams).\n- 61 -\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit. Cost of revenues includes the cost of hardware, quality assurance, overhead related to\nprofessional and support customer services, overhead related to manufacturing activity, technology licensing and royalty fees payable\nto third parties and to the IIA. Gross profit decreased to $158.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, from $178.8 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was 64.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared to 65.0% in the year ended December 31, 2022.

Gross margin percentage from products was 61.3% in the year ended December\n31, 2023 and 61.2% in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nCost of revenues related to sales of services in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 16.7% to $38.0 million, from\n$32.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is primarily attributable to higher support personnel expenses\nassociated with providing services and implementation of our products with service providers as well as enterprise customers. In the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, the gross margin percentage from sales of services decreased to 68.4%, from 70.5% in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nResearch and Development Expenses, net. Research and development expenses, net, consist primarily of salaries and related\ncosts of employees engaged in ongoing research and development activities, development-related raw materials and the cost of\nsubcontractors, less grants from the IIA. Research and development expenses decreased by 4.5% in the year ended December 31, 2023\nto $57.2 million, from $59.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. As a percentage of total revenues, research and development\nexpenses, net increased to 23.4% in the year ended December 31, 2023, from 21.8% in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease\non an absolute basis is primarily due to a decrease in the total number of our employees and related expenses. In addition, in the year\nended December 31, 2023, expenses included in research and development expenses related to share-based compensation were $2.7\nmillion, compared to $3.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. IIA grants recognized were $0.7 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs (including sales\ncommissions) of sales and marketing personnel, as well as exhibition, travel and related expenses. Selling and marketing expenses\nincreased by 0.2% in the year ended December 31, 2023 to $70.2 million, from $70.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. As\na percentage of total revenues, selling and marketing expenses increased to 28.7% in the year ended December 31, 2023, from 25.5%\nin the year ended December 31, 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2023, expenses included in selling and marketing expenses\nrelated to share-based compensation were $4.3 million, compared to $6.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of\nfinance, human resources and general management personnel, rent, network and allowance for credit losses, as well as insurance and\nconsultant services expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by 5.6% to $16.5 million in the year ended December 31,\n2023, from $17.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses\nincreased to 6.8% in the year ended December 31, 2023, from 6.4% in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease on an absolute\nbasis is primarily due to a decrease in payroll expenses. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2023, expenses included in general\nand administrative expenses related to share-based compensation were $4.0 million compared to $5.2 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nFinancial Income (Expenses), Net. Financial income (expenses), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities and bank deposits, gains from financial investments, net of interest on our bank loans and bank\ncharges, exchange rate differences and linkage differences to the Israeli consumer price Index, or Israeli CPI, and amortization of\nmarketable securities premiums and accretion of discounts, net. Financial expense, net, in the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.1\nmillion, compared to financial income, net of $2.9 in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in financial expenses, net in the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to (i) higher expenses related to exchange rate fluctuations; and (ii) higher interest\nexpenses recorded with respect to derivative instruments.\nTaxes on Income. Taxes on income in the year ended December 31, 2023, were $5.6 million, compared to $5.7 million in the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\n- 62 -\nA discussion with respect to a comparison of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2021 is contained under the heading “Results of Operations” in Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 20-F\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, or the 2022 Form 20-F.\nImpact of Inflation, Devaluation and Fluctuation of Currencies on Results of Operations, Liabilities and Assets\nSince the majority of our revenues are denominated in or linked to the dollar, we believe that inflation and fluctuations in the\nNIS/dollar exchange rate have no material impact on our revenues. However, most of the costs of our Israeli operations, mainly personnel\nand facility-related, is incurred in NIS. Inflation in Israel and dollar exchange rate fluctuations have some influence on our expenses\nand, as a result, on our net income. Our NIS costs, as expressed in dollars, are influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate\nof inflation in Israel is not offset (or is offset on a lagging basis) by a devaluation or appreciation of the NIS in relation to the dollar.\nTo protect against the changes in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from payments in NIS, we maintain\na foreign currency cash flow hedging program. We hedge portions of our forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with\nforward contracts. These measures may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects due to the impact of inflation in Israel.\nRising inflation in the United States and other markets in which we operate (or derive revenue) may impact the economy and\nultimately the demand for our products and services. See Item 3.D, “Key Information – Risk Factors – High rates of global inflation\nand the occurrence of a recession could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition” for further information regarding the risks associated with such inflation.\nThe following table presents information about the rate of inflation in Israel, the rate of devaluation of the NIS against the\ndollar, and the rate of inflation in Israel adjusted for the devaluation:\nIsraeli\ninflation\nIsraeli NIS devaluation adjusted for\ninflation or appreciation devaluation or\nYear Ended rate rate appreciation\nDecember 31, % % %\n2023 3.0 3.1 0.1\n2022 5.3 13.2 7.9\n2021 2.8 (3.3) (6.1)\nB. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have financed our operations for the last three years primarily from our cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, bank\nborrowings and cash from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $106.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities,\nshort-term and long-term financial investments and bank deposits, a decrease of $17.6 million from $124.3 million as of December 31,\n2022.\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include our lease commitments and purchase\ncommitments. For additional information on the foregoing lease commitments and purchase commitments, see Note 9 and Note 10a to\nour Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n- 63 -\nShare Repurchase Program and Cash Dividends\nIn June 2022 and in January, June and December 2023, we received court approval to purchase up to $35.0 million, $25.0\nmillion, $25.0 million and $20.0 million of our ordinary shares, respectively. The most recent court approvals allowed us to use the\napproved amounts for share repurchases or cash dividends. The Israeli court generally limits its approval to six months from the date of\napplication. As a result, although the program does not have a set end date, it requires renewal every six months by submitting a new\ncourt application, based on the then prevailing facts. Share purchases have and will take place in open market transactions or in privately\nnegotiated transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume or other factors.\nThe repurchase program does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares and may be suspended from time to time or\ndiscontinued.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired an aggregate of 1,794,931 of our ordinary shares for approximately\n$18.3 million, and declared and paid cash dividends in the aggregate amount of $11.4 million. During the year ended December 31,\n2022, we acquired an aggregate of 1,513,207 of our ordinary shares for approximately $38.1 million, and declared and paid a cash\ndividend in the aggregate amount of $11.6 million. In February 2024, we declared a cash dividend in the aggregate amount of $5.5\nmillion. As of March 20, 2024, we had approximately $10.2 million available for share repurchases or dividends under the most recent\ncourt approval granted in December 2023. The current approval is valid through June 18, 2024.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur operating activities provided cash in the approximate amount of $14.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2023,\nprimarily due to net income of $8.8 million, an increase of $3.1 million in deferred revenues, non-cash charges of $2.6 million for\ndepreciation and amortization, and $11.4 million for share-based compensation expenses and a decrease of $1.4 million in deferred tax\nassets, partially offset by a decrease of $6.2 million in other payables and accrued expenses, an increase of $7.8 million in inventories\nand a decrease of $3.8 million in trade payables.\nOur operating activities provided cash in the approximate amount of $8.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022,\nprimarily due to net income of $28.5 million, an increase of $3.5 million in trade payables, non-cash charges of $3.0 million for\ndepreciation and amortization, and $15.1 million for share-based compensation expenses, and a decrease of $1.8 million in deferred tax\nassets, partially offset by an increase of $20.6 million in trade receivables, an increase of $12.7 million in inventories, a decrease of $4.1\nmillion in other payables and accrued expenses and a decrease of $2.0 million in deferred revenues.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, our investment activities used cash in the amount of $20.0 million, primarily as a result\nof proceeds of $14.1 million derived from the redemption of financial investments and proceeds of $5.0 million derived from short-term\nand restricted bank deposits.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, our investment activities used cash in the amount of $19.7 million, primarily as a result\nof a (i) $16.6 million purchase of financial investments and (ii) $5.0 million investment in short-term and restricted bank deposits.\nFinancing Activities\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, we used $28.9 million of cash in financing activities, primarily as a result of $18.3\nmillion used to repurchase our shares and $11.4 million used to pay cash dividends to our shareholders, partially offset by $0.8 million\nof proceeds from the issuance of shares upon exercise of stock options.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, we used $48.6 million of cash in financing activities, primarily as a result of $38.1\nmillion used to repurchase our shares and $11.6 million used to pay cash dividends to our shareholders, partially offset by $1.1 million\nof proceeds from the issuance of shares upon exercise of stock options.\n- 64 -\nFinancing Needs\nWe anticipate that our operating expenses will be a material use of our cash resources for the foreseeable future. We believe\nthat our current working capital is sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Part of our\nstrategy is to pursue acquisition opportunities. If we do not have available sufficient cash to finance our operations and the completion\nof additional acquisitions, we may be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing. We cannot be certain that we will be able\nto obtain, if required, additional financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nSee Item 3.D, “Key Information – Risk Factors” with respect to risks, conditions and circumstances that could adversely impact\nour liquidity and capital resources. Information with respect to Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2022 and for the\nyear then ended is contained under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 5 of our 2022 Form 20-F.\nC. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES, ETC.\nResearch and Development\nIn order to accommodate the rapidly changing needs of our markets, we place considerable emphasis on research and\ndevelopment projects designed to improve our existing products and to develop new ones. We invest in cloud and virtualization\ntechnologies, making sure our products and technologies suit and are optimized to cloud and hosted services environments. We are also\nfurther developing our SaaS offers with solutions like SmartTAP, Meeting Insights, Voice.AI Connect, Live platform and Voca. We are\ndeveloping productivity solutions, and specialized appliances and applications for Microsoft Teams such as Direct Routing Survivable\nBranch Appliances (SBA). We are constantly enhancing our session border controllers and digital media gateways for carrier and\nenterprise deployments, multi-service business routers, IP phones and meeting room devices, and management applications with\nincreased capacity, new functionalities and compliance with the latest relevant standards and protocols.\nIn addition, we continue to maintain our analog and digital media gateways for carrier and enterprise applications, multi-service\nbusiness routers and develop further our session border controllers, IP phones, management routing and productivity applications, as\nwell as specialized appliances for Microsoft Skype/Teams for Business such as SBA, CCE and CloudBond 365. Our platforms are\nexpected to feature increased session capacity, new functionalities, enhanced signaling software and compliance with new protocols, as\nwell as new management and productivity applications. We also invest in cloud and virtualization technologies, making sure our product\nand technology suites are optimized for cloud and hosted services. As of December 31, 2023, 330 of our employees were engaged\nprimarily in research and development on a full-time basis.\nOur net research and development expenses were approximately $57.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared\nto $59.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and $53.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. From time to time, we\nhave received grants from the IIA. As a recipient of grants from the IIA, we are obligated to perform all manufacturing activities for\nprojects subject to the grants in Israel unless we receive an exemption (except for up to 10% of our manufacturing activities, which\nrequires only a notice to be made to the IIA). Know-how from research and development which is used to produce products may not be\ntransferred to third parties without the approval of the IIA and may require significant payments. The IIA approval is not required for\nthe export of any products resulting from such research or development.\nThrough December 31, 2023, we had obtained grants from the IIA aggregating approximately $7.3 million for certain of our\nresearch and development projects related to our other Israeli subsidiaries. We are obligated to pay royalties to the IIA, amounting to\n3% to 5% of the revenues from the sales of the products and other related revenues generated from such projects, up to 100% of the\ngrants received, if no additional payments are required, linked to the dollar and bearing interest at the rate of the higher of SOFR + 1%\nand 4%. The obligation to pay these royalties is contingent on actual sales of the products and in the absence of such sales no payment\nis required. If we transfer our manufacturing outside of Israel, the rate of royalties will increase.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our other Israeli subsidiaries have a contingent obligation to pay royalties in the amount of\napproximately $21.3 million.\n- 65 -\nD. TREND INFORMATION\nThere is a growing global trend of use of AI and machine learning, and we have started implementing these capabilities in our\nVoice.AI products. The Voice.AI product suite is focusing on content gathering and providing insights and predictions based on the\ncontent by using AI and machine learning.\nUsing content gathering within organizations for AI analysis has several benefits, including:\n• Improved decision-making;\n• Cost savings;\n• Increased accuracy;\n• Scalability; and\n• Competitive advantage.\nSome of the latest trends in conversational AI include:\n• Multimodal Conversational AI: Conversational AI is moving beyond text and voice to include other forms of interaction,\nsuch as images, videos and augmented reality. This allows for more natural and intuitive conversations.\n• Personalized Conversational AI: Personalized conversational AI systems are becoming more prevalent, leveraging user\ndata and machine learning algorithms to provide more personalized and relevant responses.\n• Increased Adoption of Conversational AI: As conversational AI technology becomes more advanced and accessible, it is\nbeing adopted across a range of industries and use cases, including customer service, healthcare and education.\nAnother ongoing trend is the global migration to All-IP, which continues to impact our business as it has done for several years,\nwith the shift from traditional communications systems to IP communications and unified communications. The COVID-19 pandemic\nexpedited this trend, as many organizations accelerated their plans for migration and moved their employees to a Work from Home\nenvironment or Hybrid Workplace environment.\nThe continued growth of private and public cloud-based services in the telecommunications industry has continued to impact\nour business. Adopting cloud services, such as Microsoft Teams, is an attractive proposition for enterprises and service providers, with\nthe potential to deliver significant operational and capital cost savings, as well as increased productivity and flexibility. We offer a range\nof software-based products and solutions designed with the cloud in mind. While we predict sales of these software-based solutions to\nincrease, this may result in lower revenues from our hardware-based session border controller products.\nAs data traffic becomes the dominant factor in communications, service providers are building and maintaining converged\nnetworks for integrated voice and data services. This is driving integration of new data networking technologies, such as SD-WAN and\nthe adoption of integrated devices supporting these capabilities. Additionally, aging legacy TDM switches, high-cost maintenance\ncontracts and regulatory guidelines are driving service providers worldwide to announce “PSTN shutdown” and migrate their telephony\nservices to IP communication.\nWe are experiencing decreasing demand for our technology products from customers who previously manufactured network\nequipment products based on our enabling technology. These customers are migrating from our enabling technology products to diverse\nintegrated comprehensive solutions and, as a result, the demand for our technology products is being adversely affected.\n- 66 -\nE. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require\nmanagement to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions based upon information available at the time that they are made,\nhistorical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates, judgments\nand assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.\nOur management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our Audit Committee. See the\nsection entitled “Critical Accounting Estimates” above in this Item 5 as well as Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included\nelsewhere in this Annual Report, which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required\nby U.S. GAAP.\nITEM 6.

BOARD PRACTICES\nCorporate Governance Practices\nWe are incorporated in Israel and therefore are subject to various corporate governance practices under the Companies Law,\nrelating to such matters as outside directors, the audit committee, compensation committee, the internal auditor and approvals of\n- 71 -\ninterested party transactions and of compensation of officers and directors. These matters are in addition to the ongoing listing conditions\nof the Nasdaq Global Select Market and other relevant provisions of U.S. securities laws. Under the Nasdaq rules, a foreign private\nissuer may generally follow its home country rules of corporate governance in lieu of the comparable Nasdaq requirements, except for\ncertain matters such as composition and responsibilities of the audit committee and the independence of its members. For further\ninformation, see Item 16.G, “Corporate Governance.”\nIndependent Directors\nUnder the requirements for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, a majority of our directors are required to be\nindependent as defined by Nasdaq rules. Doron Nevo, Shai Levy, Zehava Simon, Stanley Stern, Joseph Tenne and Shira Fayans\nBirenbaum qualify as independent directors under the applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules, as well as under the Companies Law.\nUnder the Companies Law, a person may not serve as an outside director if at the date of the person’s election or within the\nprior two years the person is a relative of the company’s controlling shareholder, or the person or his or her relatives, partners, employers,\nsupervisors or entities under the person’s control, have or had any affiliation with us or with a controlling shareholder or relatives of a\ncontrolling shareholder, and, in the case of a company without a controlling shareholder or a shareholder holding at least 25% of the\nvoting rights, any affiliation, at the time of election, to the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, an interested\nparty or the company’s most senior finance officer. Under the Companies Law, “affiliation” includes:\n• an employment relationship;\n• a business or professional relationship maintained on a regular basis;\n• control; and\n• service as an office holder, excluding service as a director in a private company prior to the first offering of its shares\nto the public if such director was appointed or elected as a director of the private company in order to serve as an\noutside director following the initial public offering.\nIn addition, a person may not serve as an outside director:\n• if the person or his or her relatives, partners, employers, supervisors or entities under the person’s control, maintains\na business or professional relationship with the company, even if such relationship is not on a regular basis, other than\na negligible business or professional relationship; or\n• if the person received compensation as an outside director in excess of the amounts permitted by the Companies Law\nand regulations thereunder.\nIn addition, no individual may serve as an outside director if the individual’s position or other activities create or may create a\nconflict of interest with his or her role as an outside director or are likely to interfere with his or her ability to serve as a director. Until\nthe lapse of two years from the termination of office, the company, a controlling shareholder and entities under the company’s control\nmay not grant the outside director or any of his or her relatives, directly or indirectly, any benefit, or engage the outside director or his\nor her relatives as an office holder of the company, of a controlling shareholders or of an entity under the company’s control, and may\nnot employ or receive services from the outside director or any of his or her relatives, either directly or indirectly, including through a\ncorporation controlled by that person. The restriction on a relative that is not the spouse or child of the outside director is limited to one\nyear from the termination of office instead of two years. Pursuant to the Companies Law, at least one of the outside directors appointed\nby a publicly traded company must have “financial and accounting expertise.” The other outside directors are required to possess\n“financial and accounting expertise” or “professional expertise,” as these terms are defined in regulations promulgated under the\nCompanies Law. Joseph Tenne is designated as the “audit committee financial expert” as that term is defined in the rules promulgated\nby the SEC.\n- 72 -\nOutside directors are elected by a majority vote at a shareholders’ meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder\napproval of the election of an outside director must satisfy either of two additional tests:\n• the majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders other than our controlling shareholders or\nshareholders who have a personal interest in the election of the outside directors (excluding a personal interest that is\nnot related to a relationship with the controlling shareholders); or\n• the total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and disinterested shareholders that voted against the\nelection of the outside director does not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights of our company.\nThe initial term of an outside director is three years and may be extended for up to two additional three-year terms. Thereafter,\nhe or she may be reelected by our shareholders for additional periods of up to three years each only if the audit committee and the board\nof directors confirm that, in light of the outside director’s expertise and special contribution to the work of the Board of Directors and\nits committees, the reelection for such additional period is beneficial to the company. Reelection of an outside director may be effected\nthrough one of the following mechanisms: (1) the board of directors proposed the reelection of the nominee and the election was\napproved by the shareholders by the majority required to appoint outside directors for their initial term; or (2) one or more shareholders\nholding one percent or more of a company’s voting rights or the outside director proposed the reelection of the nominee, and the\nreelection is approved by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders of the company, excluding the votes of controlling shareholders\nand those who have a personal interest in the matter as a result of their relations with the controlling shareholders, provided that the\naggregate votes cast in favor of the reelection by such non-excluded shareholders constitute more than two percent of the voting rights\nin the company.\nPursuant to the Companies Law, an Israeli company whose shares are publicly traded may elect to adopt a provision in its\narticles of association pursuant to which a majority of its board of directors (or a third of its board of directors in case the company has\na controlling shareholder) will constitute individuals complying with certain independence criteria prescribed by the Companies Law.\nPursuant to the related regulations, directors who comply with the independence requirements of the Nasdaq and SEC regulations are\ndeemed to comply with the independence requirements of the Companies Law. We have not included such a provision in our articles of\nassociation since our board of directors complies with the independence requirements of the Nasdaq and SEC regulations described\nabove. In any event, as described above, a majority of our board of directors and all members of our audit committee are directors who\ncomply with the independence criteria prescribed by the Companies Law.\nAn outside director is entitled to compensation as provided in the regulations adopted under the Companies Law and is\notherwise prohibited from receiving any other compensation, directly or indirectly, from the company. In accordance with such\nregulations, our shareholders approved that our outside directors are to receive compensation equal to that paid to the other members of\nthe board of directors. For further information, please see Item 6.B, “Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Compensation”\nin this Annual Report.\nAudit Committee\nUnder the Companies Law and the requirements for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, our board of directors is\nrequired to appoint an audit committee. Our audit committee must be comprised of at least three directors, including all of the outside\ndirectors (one of whom must serve as the chair of the audit committee), and a majority of the committee members must comply with the\ndirector independence requirements prescribed by the Companies Law. The audit committee consists of: Doron Nevo, Shai Levy, Joseph\nTenne and Shira Fayans Birenbaum with Doron Nevo serving as the chairman of the audit committee. Our board of directors has\ndetermined that Joseph Tenne is an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in SEC rules and that all members of the audit\ncommittee are independent under the applicable SEC rules, Nasdaq rules and provisions of the Companies Law.\nThe audit committee may not include the chairman of the board, or any director employed by us, by a controlling shareholder\nor by any entity controlled by a controlling shareholder, or any director providing services to us, to a controlling shareholder or to any\nentity controlled by a controlling shareholder on a regular basis, or any director whose income is primarily dependent on a controlling\nshareholder, and may not include a controlling shareholder or any relatives of a controlling shareholder. Individuals who are not\npermitted to be audit committee members may not participate in the committee’s meetings other than to present a particular issue.\nHowever, an employee who is not a controlling shareholder or relative may participate in the committee’s discussions but not in any\n- 73 -\nvote, and the company’s legal counsel and corporate secretary may participate in the committee’s discussions and votes if requested by\nthe committee.\nUnder the Companies Law, a meeting of the audit committee is properly convened if a majority of the committee members\nattend the meeting, and in addition a majority of the attending committee members are independent directors within the meaning of the\nCompanies Law and include at least one outside director.\nWe have adopted an audit committee charter as required by Nasdaq rules. The audit committee’s duties include providing\nassistance to the board of directors in fulfilling its legal and fiduciary obligations in matters involving our accounting, auditing, financial\nreporting, internal control and legal compliance functions by approving the fees of, and services performed by, our independent\naccountants and reviewing their reports regarding our accounting practices and systems of internal accounting controls. The audit\ncommittee also oversees the audit efforts of our independent accountants and takes those actions as it deems necessary to satisfy itself\nthat the accountants are independent of management. Under the Companies Law, the audit committee also is required to monitor\ndeficiencies in the administration of our company, including by consulting with the internal auditor and independent accountants, to\nreview, classify and approve related party transactions and extraordinary transactions, to review the internal auditor’s audit plan and to\nestablish and monitor whistleblower procedures.\n- 74 -\nNominating Committee\nNasdaq rules require that director nominees be selected or recommended for the board’s selection either by a committee\ncomposed solely of independent directors or by a majority of independent directors. Our nominating committee assists the board of\ndirectors in its selection of individuals as nominees for election to the board of directors and/or to fill any vacancies or newly created\ndirectorships on the board of directors. The nominating committee consists of Doron Nevo, Shai Levy, Joseph Tenne and Zehava Simon,\nwith Doron Nevo serving as the chairman of the nominating committee. All members of the nominating committee are independent\nunder the applicable Nasdaq rules and provisions of the Companies Law.\nCompensation Committee\nUnder the Companies Law, the board of directors of any public company must establish a compensation committee. The\ncompensation committee must consist of at least three directors, include all of the outside directors (including one outside director\nserving as the chair of the compensation committee), and a majority of the committee members must comply with the director\nindependence requirements prescribed by the Companies Law. Similar to the rules that apply to the audit committee, the compensation\ncommittee may not include the chairman of the board, or any director employed by us, by a controlling shareholder or by any entity\ncontrolled by a controlling shareholder, or any director providing services to us, to a controlling shareholder or to any entity controlled\nby a controlling shareholder on a regular basis, or any director whose primary income is dependent on a controlling shareholder, and\nmay not include a controlling shareholder or any of its relatives. Individuals who are not permitted to be compensation committee\nmembers may not participate in the committee’s meetings other than to present a particular issue; however, an employee who is not a\ncontrolling shareholder or relative may participate in the committee’s discussions, but not in any vote, and the company’s legal counsel\nand corporate secretary may participate in the committee’s discussions and votes if requested by the committee.\nThe compensation committee’s duties include recommending to the board of directors a compensation policy for executives\nand monitor its implementation, approve compensation terms of executive officers, directors and employees affiliated with controlling\nshareholders, make recommendations to the board of directors regarding the issuance of equity incentive awards under our equity\nincentive plan and exempt certain compensation arrangements from the requirement to obtain shareholder approval under the Companies\nLaw. The compensation committee meets at least twice a year, with further meetings to occur, or actions to be taken by unanimous\nwritten consent, when deemed necessary or desirable by the committee or its chairperson. For information regarding the compensation\npolicy for executives, see Item 10.B, “Additional Information – Memorandum and Articles of Association – Compensation of Executive\nOfficers and Directors; Executive Compensation Policy.”\nThe compensation committee consists of Doron Nevo, Shai Levy, Joseph Tenne and Zehava Simon, with Doron Nevo serving\nas the chairman of the compensation committee. All members of the compensation committee are independent under the applicable SEC\nrules, Nasdaq rules and provisions of the Companies Law.\nInternal Auditor\nUnder the Companies Law, our board of directors is also required to appoint an internal auditor proposed by the audit\ncommittee. The internal auditor may be our employee, but may not be an interested party or office holder, or a relative of any interested\nparty or office holder, and may not be a member of our independent accounting firm. The role of the internal auditor is to examine,\namong other things, whether our activities comply with the law and orderly business procedure. Mr. Oren Grupi of KPMG Somekh\nChaikin, Israel has been our internal auditor since July 2018.\n- 75 -\nBoard Classes\nPursuant to our articles of association, our directors, other than our outside directors, are classified into three classes (classes\nI, II and III).

Furthermore,\nIsraeli employees and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute, which include payments\nfor national health insurance. The payments to the National Insurance Institute currently range from approximately 7.05% to 19.6% of\nwages up to specified wage levels, of which the employee contributes approximately 60% and the employer contributes approximately\n40%.\nOur employees in Israel are subject to certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General\nFederation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the Industrialists Associations) by\norder of the Israeli Minister of Economy and Industry.

To date, we have not experienced any work\nstoppages.\nPursuant to an order issued by the Israeli Minister of Economy and Industry, provisions relating to pension arrangements in the\ncollective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations apply to all employees\nin Israel, including our employees in Israel. We regularly contribute to a “Manager’s Insurance Fund” or to a privately managed pension\nfund on behalf of our employees located in Israel. These funds provide employees with a lump sum payment upon retirement (or a\npension, in case of a pension fund) and severance pay, if legally entitled thereto, upon termination of employment. We provide for\npayments to a Manager’s Insurance Fund and pension fund contributions in the amount of 14.83% of an employee’s salary on account\nof severance pay and provident payment or pension, with the employee contributing 6.0% of his salary. We also pay an additional\namount of up to 2.5% of certain of our employees’ salaries in connection with disability payments. In addition, we administer an\nEducation Fund for our Israeli employees and pay 7.5% of these employees’ salaries thereto, with the employees contributing 2.5% of\ntheir salary.\nE.

Our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan is pursuant to Israeli Income Tax Ordinance (New Version), 1961, or the Israeli Income\nTax Ordinance, entitling the beneficiaries who are our employees to tax benefits under Israeli law. There are various conditions that\nmust be met in order to qualify for these benefits, including registration of the options in the name of a trustee for each of the beneficiaries\nwho is granted options. For tax benefits each option, and any ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of the option, must be held by\nthe trustee at least for a period commencing on the date of grant and ending no later than 24 months after the date of grant, in accordance\nwith the period of time specified by Section 102 of the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance, or Section 102, and deposited in trust with the\ntrustee.\n2008 Equity Incentive Plan\nWe adopted an equity incentive plan under Section 102, which provides certain tax benefits in connection with share-based\ncompensation to employees, officers and directors. This plan, our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, was approved by the Israel Tax Authority.\nUnder our equity incentive plan, we may grant our directors, officers and employees restricted shares, restricted share units and\noptions to purchase our ordinary shares under Section 102. We may also grant other persons awards under our equity incentive plan.\nHowever, such other persons (controlling shareholders and consultants) will not enjoy the tax benefits provided by Section 102. The\ntotal number of ordinary shares that were originally available for grant under the 2008 Plan was 2,009,122, which was increased to\n4,009,122 in 2010, 6,009,122 in 2013, 8,009,122 in 2016, 10,009,122 in 2019 and 12,009,122 in 2022. This number is reduced by one\nshare for each equity grant we make under the 2008 Plan. During 2023, options to purchase 20,000 ordinary shares and 589,042 restricted\nshare units were granted under the 2008 Plan. As of December 31, 2023, 1,729,170 ordinary shares remained available for grant under\nthe 2008 Plan. As of December 31, 2023, there are 265,300 options to purchase ordinary shares and 1,231,879 restricted share units\noutstanding under the plan.\n- 78 -\nThe Israel Tax Authority approved the 2008 Plan under the capital gains tax track of Section 102. Based on Israeli law currently\nin effect and the election of the capital gains tax track, and provided that options, restricted shares and restricted shares units granted or,\nupon their exercise or vesting, the underlying shares, issued under the plan are held by a trustee for the two years following the date in\nwhich such awards are granted, our employees, officers and directors will be (i) entitled to defer any taxable event with respect to the\nawards until the underlying ordinary shares are sold, and (ii) subject to capital gains tax of 25% on the sale of the shares. However, if\nwe grant awards at a value below the underlying shares’ market value at the date of grant, the 25% capital gains tax rate will apply only\nwith respect to capital gains in excess of the underlying shares’ market value at the date of grant and the remaining capital gains will be\ntaxed at the grantee’s regular tax rate. We may not recognize a tax benefit pertaining to the employees’ restricted shares, restricted share\nunits and options for tax purposes except in the events described above under which the gain is taxed at the grantee’s regular tax rate.\nRestricted shares, restricted share units and options granted under the 2008 Plan will vest over four years from the grant date\nor in accordance with the alternative vesting schedule applicable to the specific grant. If the employment of an employee is terminated\nfor any reason, the employee (or in the case of death, the designated beneficiary) may exercise his or her vested options within\nninety days of the date of termination (or within twelve months of the date of termination in the case of death or disability) and shall be\nentitled to any rights upon vested restricted shares and vested restricted share units to be delivered to the employee to the extent that\nthey were vested prior to the date his or her employment terminates. Directors are generally eligible to exercise his or her vested options\nwithin twelve months from the date the director ceases to serve on the board of directors.\nThe holders of options under all of the plans are responsible for all personal tax consequences relating to the options. The\nexercise prices of the options are based on the fair value of the ordinary shares at the time of grant, as determined by our board of\ndirectors. The current practice of our board of directors is to grant options with exercise prices that equal 100% of the closing price of\nour ordinary shares on the applicable date of grant.\nF.

MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\nObjectives\nOur objectives, set forth in our articles of association, are to engage in any legal occupation or business.\nShare Capital\nOur authorized share capital consists of NIS 1,025,000 divided into 100,000,000 ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 0.01 per\nshare, and 2,500,000 preferred shares, nominal value NIS 0.01 per share. As of March 20, 2024, we had 30,324,284 ordinary\nshares outstanding (which does not include 34,406,682 treasury shares) and no preferred shares outstanding.\nBorrowing Powers\nThe board of directors has the power to cause us to borrow money and to secure the payment of borrowed money. The board\nof directors specifically has the power to issue bonds or debentures, and to impose mortgages or other security interests on all or any\npart of our property.\nAmendment of Articles of Association\nIn general, shareholders may amend our articles of association by a resolution adopted at a shareholders meeting by the holders\nof 50% of the voting power represented at the meeting in person or by proxy and voting thereon. The amendment of certain provisions\nof our articles of association requires an increased voting threshold. For example, the approval of amendments to the provisions\nconcerning business combinations with certain shareholders requires the approval of holders of 85% of our outstanding voting shares.\nAdditionally, the amendment of the provisions concerning (i) the procedure according to which shareholders may propose items to\ninclude in the agenda of a general meeting of the shareholders and (ii) the role and composition of the board of directors, including the\nmethod of appointment of its members, require the approval sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3)% of the voting power represented\nat the meeting in person or by proxy and voting thereon.\nQualification of Directors\nNo person shall be disqualified to serve as a director by reason of his not holding AudioCodes shares or by reason of his having\nserved as a director in the past.\nDividends\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may make “distributions”, as such term is defined in the Companies Law (which\ndefinition includes the payment of dividends and a company’s repurchase of its outstanding shares) only out of its profits as determined\nfor statutory purposes, unless court approval is granted for such despite the lack of statutory profits. There is a unified statutory test for\nthe payment of dividends and a company’s repurchase of its outstanding shares. In 2023, we received court approval to pay dividends\n(and repurchase our shares) up to certain ceilings, despite the lack of statutory profits. The current approval is valid until June 18, 2024.\nWe may seek further approvals to repurchase our shares and to continue to pay dividends. As we are a Nasdaq-listed company, court\napproval is not required for our repurchase of our shares, provided that we notify our creditors of the proposed repurchase and allow\nsuch creditors an opportunity to initiate a court proceeding to review the repurchase. If within 30 days such creditors do not file an\nobjection, then we may proceed with the repurchase. In each case, we are only permitted to make the distribution if our board of directors\nand, if applicable, the court, determines there is no reasonable concern that such distribution will prevent us from satisfying our existing\nand foreseeable obligations as they become due. The amount of any dividend to be distributed among shareholders is based on the\nnominal value of their shares.\n- 82 -\nVoting Rights and Powers\nUnless any shares have special rights as to voting, every shareholder has one vote for each share held of record.\nUnder our articles of association, we may issue preferred shares from time to time, in one or more series. However, in\nconnection with our listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2001, we agreed that for such time as our ordinary shares are traded on\nthe Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, we will not issue any of the 2,500,000 preferred shares, nominal value NIS 0.01, authorized in our articles\nof association. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may issue preferred shares if the preference of those shares is limited to a preference\nin the distribution of dividends and such preferred shares have no voting rights.\nBusiness Combinations\nOur articles of association impose restrictions on our ability to engage in any merger, asset or share sale or other similar\ntransaction with a shareholder holding 15% or more of our voting shares.\nWinding Up\nUpon our liquidation, our assets available for distribution to shareholders will be distributed to them in proportion to the\nnominal value of their shares.\nRedeemable Shares\nSubject to our undertaking to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange as described above, we may issue and redeem redeemable shares.\nModification of Rights\nSubject to the provisions of our articles of association, we may, from time to time, by a resolution approved by the holders of\na simple majority of the voting power represented at the meeting in person or by proxy and voting thereon, provide for shares with such\npreference rights, deferred rights or conversion rights, or any other special rights or limitations as may be stipulated in such resolution.\nIf at any time our share capital is divided into different classes of shares, we may modify or abrogate the rights attached to any\nclass, unless otherwise provided by the articles of association, by a resolution approved by the holders of a simple majority of the voting\npower represented at the meeting in person or by proxy and voting thereon, subject to the consent in writing of the holders of a simple\nmajority of the issued shares of that class (unless otherwise provided by law or by the terms of issue of the shares of that class).\nThe provisions of our articles of association relating to general meetings also apply, mutatis mutandis, to any separate general\nmeeting of the holders of the shares of a particular class.\nThe creation or issuance of shares of any class, including a new class, shall not be deemed to alter the rights and privileges\nattached to previously issued shares of that class or of any other class (unless otherwise provided by our articles of association, including\nthe terms of issue of the shares of any class).\nShareholder Meetings\nAn annual meeting of shareholders is to be held once a year, within 15 months after the previous annual meeting. The annual\nmeeting may be held in Israel or outside of Israel, as determined by the board of directors.\nThe board of directors may, whenever it thinks fit, convene a special shareholders meeting. The board of directors must convene\na special shareholders meeting at the request of:\n• at least two directors;\n• at least one-quarter of the directors in office; or\n- 83 -\n• one or more shareholders who hold at least 10% of the outstanding share capital and at least 1% of the voting rights,\nor one or more shareholders who hold at least 10% of the outstanding voting rights.\nNotice of General Meetings; Omission to Give Notice\nA special shareholders meeting may be held in Israel or outside of Israel, as determined by the board of directors.\nThe provisions of the Companies Law and the related regulations override the provisions of our articles of association, and\nprovide for notice of a meeting of shareholders to be sent to each registered shareholder at least 21 days or 35 days in advance of the\nmeeting, depending on the items included in the meeting agenda. Notice of a meeting of shareholders must also be published in two\nIsraeli newspapers or on our website.\nNotice of a meeting of shareholders must specify the type of meeting, the place and time of the meeting, the agenda, a summary\nof the proposed resolutions, the majority required to adopt the proposed resolutions, and the record date for the meeting. The notice\nmust also include the address and telephone number of our registered office, and a list of times at which the full text of the proposed\nresolutions may be examined at the registered office.\nThe accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to any shareholder, or the non-receipt of notice sent to such shareholder,\ndoes not invalidate the proceedings at the meeting.\nLimitations on Foreign Shareholders to Hold or Exercise Voting Rights\nThere are no limitations on foreign shareholders in our articles of association. Israeli law restricts the ability of citizens of\ncountries that are in a state of war with Israel to hold shares of Israeli companies.\nFiduciary Duties; Approval of Transactions under Israeli Law\nFiduciary duties. The Companies Law codifies the fiduciary duties that office holders, which under the Companies Law\nincludes our directors and executive officers, owe to a company. An office holder’s fiduciary duties consist of a duty of loyalty and a\nduty of care.\nThe duty of loyalty requires an office holder to act in good faith and for the benefit of the company, including to avoid any\nconflict of interest between the office holder’s position in the company and personal affairs, and prohibits any competition with the\ncompany or the exploitation of any business opportunity of the company in order to receive a personal advantage for himself or herself\nor for others. This duty also requires an office holder to reveal to the company any information or documents relating to the company’s\naffairs that the office holder has received due to his or her position as an office holder. A company may approve any of the acts mentioned\nabove provided that all the following conditions apply: the office holder acted in good faith and neither the act nor the approval of the\nact prejudices the good of the company and, the office holder disclosed the essence of his personal interest in the act, including any\nsubstantial fact or document, a reasonable time before the date for discussion of the approval. A director is required to exercise\nindependent discretion in fulfilling his or her duties and may not be party to a voting agreement with respect to his or her vote as a\ndirector. A violation of these requirements is deemed a breach of the director’s duty of loyalty.\nThe duty of care requires an office holder to act with a level of care that a reasonable office holder in the same position would\nemploy under the same circumstances. This includes the duty to use reasonable means to obtain information regarding the advisability\nof a given action submitted for his or her approval or performed by virtue of his or her position and all other relevant information material\nto these actions.\nDisclosure of personal interest. The Companies Law requires that an office holder promptly disclose to the company any\npersonal interest that he or she may have and all related material information or documents known to him or her, in connection with any\nexisting or proposed transaction by the company. “Personal interest,” as defined by the Companies Law, includes a personal interest of\nany person in an act or transaction of the company, including a personal interest of his relative or of a corporation in which that person\nor a relative of that person is a 5% or greater shareholder, a holder of 5% or more of the voting rights, a director or general manager, or\nin which he or she has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager, and includes shares for which the person has the\nright to vote pursuant to a power-of-attorney. “Personal interest” does not apply to a personal interest stemming merely from holding\nshares in the company.\n- 84 -\nThe office holder must make the disclosure of his personal interest no later than the first meeting of the company’s board of\ndirectors that discusses the particular transaction. This duty does not apply to the personal interest of a relative of the office holder in a\ntransaction unless it is an “extraordinary transaction.” The Companies Law defines an “extraordinary transaction” as a transaction that\nis not in the ordinary course of business, not on market terms or that is likely to have a material impact on the company’s profitability,\nassets or liabilities.\nApprovals. The Companies Law provides that a transaction with an office holder or a transaction in which an office holder has\na personal interest requires board approval, unless the transaction is an extraordinary transaction or the articles of association provide\notherwise. Our articles of association do not provide otherwise. The transaction may be approved only if it is in our best interest. If the\ntransaction is an extraordinary transaction, then the approvals of the company’s audit committee and the board of directors are required.\nIf the transaction concerns exculpation, indemnification, insurance or compensation of an office holder, then the approvals of the\ncompany’s compensation committee and the board of directors are required, except if the compensation arrangement is an immaterial\namendment to an existing compensation arrangement of an officer who is not a director, in which case the approval of the compensation\ncommittee is sufficient. Exculpation, indemnification, insurance or compensation of a director or the Chief Executive Officer also\nrequires shareholder approval.\nA person who has a personal interest in a matter that is considered at a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee\ngenerally may not attend that meeting or vote on that matter, unless a majority of the board of directors or the audit committee has a\npersonal interest in the matter or if such person is invited by the chairman of the board of directors or audit committee, as applicable, to\npresent the matter being considered. If a majority of the board of directors or the audit committee has a personal interest in the transaction,\nshareholder approval also would be required.\nShareholders\nThe Companies Law imposes on a controlling shareholder of a public company the same disclosure requirements described\nabove as it imposes on an office holder. For this purpose, a “controlling shareholder” is any shareholder who has the ability to direct the\ncompany’s actions, including any shareholder holding 25% or more of the voting rights if no other shareholder owns more than 50% of\nthe voting rights in the company. Two or more shareholders with a personal interest in the approval of the same transaction are deemed\nto be one shareholder.\nApproval of the audit committee, the board of directors and our shareholders, in that order, is required for extraordinary\ntransactions, including a private placement, with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest.\nApproval of the compensation committee, the board of directors and our shareholders, in that order, is required for the terms\nof compensation or employment of a controlling shareholder or his or her relative, as an officer holder or employee of our company or\nas a service provider to the company, including through a company controlled by a controlling shareholder.\nShareholder approval must include the majority of shares voted at the meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder\napproval must satisfy either of two additional tests:\n• the majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders who have no personal interest in the\ntransaction; or\n• the total number of shares held by disinterested shareholders that voted against the approval of the transaction does\nnot exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights of our company.\nGenerally, the approval of such a transaction may not extend for more than three years, except that in the case of an\nextraordinary transaction, including a private placement, with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a\npersonal interest that does not concern compensation for employment or service, the transaction may be approved for a longer period if\nthe audit committee determines that the approval of the transaction for a period longer than three years is reasonable under the\ncircumstances.\n- 85 -\nCompensation of Executive Officers and Directors; Executive Compensation Policy\nIn accordance with the Companies Law, we have adopted a compensation policy for our executive officers and directors. The\npurpose of the policy is to describe our overall compensation strategy for our executive officers and directors and to provide guidelines\nfor setting their compensation, as prescribed by the Companies Law. In accordance with the Companies Law, the policy must be\nreviewed and readopted at least once every three years.\nApproval of the compensation committee, the board of directors and our shareholders, in that order, is required for the adoption\nof the compensation policy. The shareholders’ approval must include the majority of shares voted at the meeting. In addition to the\nmajority vote, the shareholder approval must satisfy either of two additional tests:\n• the majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders other than our controlling shareholders or\nshareholders who have a personal interest in the adoption of the compensation policy; or\n• the total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and disinterested shareholders that voted against the\nadoption of the compensation policy does not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights of our company.\nUnder the Companies Law, the compensation arrangements for officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer) who are not\ndirectors require the approval of the compensation committee and the board of directors; provided, however, that if the compensation\narrangement is not in compliance with our executive compensation policy, the arrangement may only be approved by the compensation\ncommittee and the board of directors for special reasons to be noted, and the compensation arrangement shall also require a special\nshareholder approval. If the compensation arrangement is an immaterial amendment to an existing compensation arrangement of an\nofficer who is not a director and is in compliance with our executive compensation policy, the approval of the compensation committee\nis sufficient.\nArrangements regarding the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and of directors require the approval of the\ncompensation committee, the board and the shareholders, in that order. In certain limited cases, the compensation of a new Chief\nExecutive Officer who is not a director may be approved without the approval of the shareholders.\nIn August 2023 our board of directors approved certain amendments to our compensation policy in order to adopt a clawback\npolicy, or the Clawback Policy, which is administered by our compensation committee and was adopted in compliance with Section\n10D of the Exchange Act and applicable rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Clawback Policy, which was additionally\napproved by our shareholders on October 24, 2023 in connection with our 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, requires the\nreturn of incentive compensation paid to our executive officers in the case of certain restatements of our financial statements under the\nrules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. A copy of the Clawback Policy is included as Exhibit 97.1 to this Annual Report.\nDuties of Shareholders\nUnder the Companies Law, a shareholder also has a duty to act in good faith towards the company and other shareholders and\nrefrain from abusing his or her power in the company, including, among other things, voting in the general meeting of shareholders on\nthe following matters:\n• any amendment to the articles of association;\n• an increase of the company’s authorized share capital;\n• a merger; or\n• approval of related party transactions that require shareholder approval.\n- 86 -\nIn addition, any controlling shareholder, any shareholder who can determine the outcome of a shareholder vote and any\nshareholder who, under the company’s articles of association, can appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder, is under a\nduty to act with fairness towards the company. The Companies Law also provides that a breach of the duty of fairness will be governed\nby the laws governing breach of contract; however, the Companies Law does not describe the substance of this duty.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions under Israeli Law\nThe Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as\na result of the acquisition the purchaser would hold 25% or more of the voting rights in the company, unless there is already another\nshareholder of the company with 25% or more of the voting rights. Similarly, the Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares\nin a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would hold more than 45%\nof the voting rights in the company, unless there is a shareholder with more than 45% of the voting rights in the company.\nThe Companies Law requires the parties to a proposed merger to file a merger proposal with the Israeli Registrar of Companies,\nspecifying certain terms of the transaction. Each merging company’s board of directors and shareholders must approve the merger.\nShares in one of the merging companies held by the other merging company or certain of its affiliates are disenfranchised for purposes\nof voting on the merger. A merging company must inform its creditors of the proposed merger. Any creditor of a party to the merger\nmay seek a court order blocking the merger, if there is a reasonable concern that the surviving company will not be able to satisfy all of\nthe obligations of the parties to the merger. Moreover, a merger may not be completed until at least 50 days have passed from the time\nthat the merger proposal was filed with the Israeli Registrar of Companies and at least 30 days have passed from the approval of the\nshareholders of each of the merging companies.\nFinally, in general, Israeli tax law treats stock-for-stock acquisitions less favorably than does U.S. tax law. Israeli tax law\nprovides for tax deferral in specified acquisitions, including transactions where the consideration for the sale of shares is the receipt of\nshares of the acquiring company. Nevertheless, Israeli tax law may subject a shareholder who exchanges his ordinary shares for shares\nin a foreign corporation to immediate taxation or to taxation before his investment in the foreign corporation becomes liquid, although\nin the case of shares of a foreign corporation that are traded on a stock exchange, the tax may be postponed subject to certain conditions.\nInsurance, Indemnification and Exculpation of Directors and Officers; Limitations on Liability\nInsurance of Office Holders\nThe Companies Law permits a company, if permitted by its articles of association, to insure an office holder in respect of\nliabilities incurred by the office holder as a result of:\n• breach of the duty of care owed to the company or a third party;\n• breach of the fiduciary duty owed to the company, provided that the office holder acted in good faith and had\nreasonable grounds to believe that his action would not harm the company’s interests;\n• monetary liability imposed on the office holder in favor of a third party; and\n• reasonable litigation expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by the office holder as a result of an administrative\nenforcement proceeding instituted against him (without limiting from the generality of the foregoing, such expenses\nwill include a payment imposed on the office holder in favor of an injured party as set forth in\nSection 52(54)(a)(1)(a) of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968, as amended, or the Israeli Securities Law, and expenses\nthat the office holder incurred in connection with a proceeding under Chapters H’3, H’4 or I’1 of the Israeli Securities\nLaw, including reasonable legal expenses, which term includes attorney fees).\n- 87 -\nIndemnification of Office Holders\nUnder the Companies Law, a company can, if permitted by its articles of association, indemnify an office holder for any of the\nfollowing obligations or expenses incurred in connection with his or her acts or omissions as an office holder:\n• monetary liability imposed on an office holder in favor of a third party in a judgment, including a settlement or an\narbitral award confirmed by a court;\n• reasonable legal costs, including attorney’s fees, expended by an office holder as a result of:\n- an investigation or proceeding instituted against the office holder by a competent authority, provided that\nsuch investigation or proceeding concludes without the filing of an indictment against the office holder, and\neither:\no no financial liability was imposed on the office holder in lieu of criminal proceedings, or\no financial liability was imposed on the office holder in lieu of criminal proceedings but the alleged\ncriminal offense does not require proof of criminal intent; and (y) in connection with an\nadministrative enforcement proceeding or a financial sanction (without derogating from the\ngenerality of the foregoing, such expenses will include a payment imposed on the Office Holder in\nfavor of an injured party as set forth in Section 52(54)(a)(1)(a) of the Israeli Securities Law, and\nexpenses that the Office Holder incurred in connection with a proceeding under Chapters H’3, H’4\nor I’1 of the Israeli Securities Law, including reasonable legal expenses, which term includes\nattorney fees); and\n• reasonable legal costs, including attorneys’ fees, expended by the office holder or for which the office holder is\ncharged by a court:\n- in an action brought against the office holder by or on behalf of the company or a third party, or\n- in a criminal action in which the office holder is found innocent, or\n- in a criminal action in which the office holder is convicted and in which a proof of criminal intent is not\nrequired.\no A company may indemnify an office holder in respect of these liabilities either in advance of an\nevent or following an event. If a company undertakes to indemnify an office holder in advance of\nan event, the indemnification, other than legal costs, must be limited to foreseeable events in light\nof the company’s actual activities when the company undertook such indemnification, and\nreasonable amounts or standards, as determined by the board of directors.\nExculpation of Office Holders\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may, if permitted by its articles of association, also exculpate an office holder in\nadvance, in whole or in part, from liability for damages sustained by a breach of duty of care to the company, other than in connection\nwith distributions.\n- 88 -\nLimitations on Exculpation, Insurance and Indemnification\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may indemnify or insure an office holder against a breach of duty of loyalty only to the\nextent that the office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds to assume that the action would not prejudice the company.\nIn addition, a company may not indemnify, insure or exculpate an office holder against a breach of duty of care if committed intentionally\nor recklessly (excluding mere negligence), or committed with the intent to derive an unlawful personal gain, or for a fine or forfeit levied\nagainst the office holder in connection with a criminal offense.\nOur articles of association allow us to insure, indemnify and exculpate office holders to the fullest extent permitted by law,\nprovided such insurance or indemnification is approved in accordance with law. Pursuant to the Companies Law, exculpation of,\nprocurement of insurance coverage for, and an undertaking to indemnify or indemnification of, our office holders must be approved by\nour audit committee and our board of directors and, if the office holder is a director, also by our shareholders.\nWe have entered into agreements with each of our directors and senior officers to insure, indemnify and exculpate them to the\nfull extent permitted by law against some types of claims, subject to dollar limits and other limitations. These agreements have been\nratified by our audit committee, board of directors and shareholders. We have acquired directors’ and officers’ liability insurance\ncovering our officers and directors and the officers and directors of our subsidiaries against certain claims.\nC. MATERIAL CONTRACTS\nNone.\nD. EXCHANGE CONTROLS\nNon-residents of Israel who own our ordinary shares may freely convert all amounts received in Israeli currency in respect of\nsuch ordinary shares, whether as a dividend, liquidation distribution or as proceeds from the sale of the ordinary shares, into freely-\nrepatriable non-Israeli currencies at the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of conversion (provided in each case that the applicable\nIsraeli income tax, if any, is paid or withheld).\nSince January 1, 2003, all exchange control restrictions on transactions in foreign currency in Israel have been eliminated,\nalthough there are still reporting requirements for foreign currency transactions. Legislation remains in effect, however, pursuant to\nwhich currency controls may be imposed by administrative action at any time.\nThe State of Israel does not restrict in any way the ownership or voting of our ordinary shares by non-residents of Israel, except\nwith respect to subjects of countries that are in a state of war with Israel.\nE. TAXATION\nThe following is a summary of the material Israeli and United States federal tax consequences, Israeli foreign exchange\nregulations and certain Israeli government programs affecting us. To the extent that the discussion is based on new tax or other legislation\nthat has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, there can be no assurance that the views expressed in the discussion\nwill be accepted by the tax or other authorities in question. The discussion is not intended, and should not be construed, as legal or\nprofessional tax advice, is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations and should not be relied upon for tax planning purposes.\nPotential investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the Israeli tax, United States federal income tax and other tax\nconsequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of ordinary shares, including, in particular, the effect of any foreign, state or\nlocal taxes.\n- 89 -\nIsraeli Tax Considerations and Government Programs\nThe following is a brief summary of the material Israeli income tax laws applicable to us, and certain Israeli Government\nprograms that benefit us. This section also contains a discussion of material Israeli income tax consequences concerning the ownership\nand disposition of our ordinary shares. This summary does not discuss all the aspects of Israeli tax law that may be relevant to a particular\ninvestor in light of his or her personal investment circumstances or to some types of investors subject to special treatment under Israeli\nlaw. Examples of such investors include residents of Israel or traders in securities who are subject to special tax regimes not covered in\nthis discussion. Several parts of this discussion are based on new tax legislation that has not yet been subject to judicial or administrative\ninterpretation. Each investor should consult its own tax or legal advisor as to the Israeli tax consequences of the purchase, ownership\nand disposition of our ordinary shares.\nGeneral Corporate Tax Structure in Israel\nIsraeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax on their taxable income. Taxable income of a company is subject to a corporate\ntax rate of 23% effective from January 1, 2018. However, the effective tax rate payable by a company that qualifies as an Industrial\nCompany that derives income from a Preferred Technological Enterprise (as discussed below) may be considerably less. Capital gains\nderived by an Israeli company are subject to the prevailing corporate tax rate.\nLaw for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, or the Investment Law\nThe Investment Law provides certain incentives for capital investments in production facilities (or other eligible assets) by\n“Industrial Enterprises” (as defined under the Investment Law).\nThe Investment Law was significantly amended effective April 1, 2005, or the 2005 Amendment, and further amended as of\nJanuary 1, 2011, or the 2011 Amendment, and January 1, 2017, or the 2017 Amendment. The 2011 Amendment introduced new benefits\nto replace those granted in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law in effect prior to the 2011 Amendment. However,\ncompanies entitled to benefits under the Investment Law as in effect prior to January 1, 2011, were entitled to choose to continue to\nenjoy such benefits, provided that certain conditions are met, or elect instead irrevocably to forego such benefits and have the benefits\nof the 2011 Amendment apply. The 2017 Amendment was designed to accommodate the implementation of the “Nexus Principles”\n(based on OECD guidelines published as part of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, project).\nTax Benefits Prior to the 2005 Amendment\nAn investment program that is implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law prior to the 2005\nAmendment, referred to as an “Approved Enterprise,” is entitled to certain benefits. A company that wished to receive benefits as an\nApproved Enterprise must have received approval from the Investment Center of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, or the\nInvestment Center. Each certificate of approval for an Approved Enterprise relates to a specific investment program in the Approved\nEnterprise, delineated both by the financial scope of the investment and by the physical characteristics of the facility or the asset.\nThe tax benefits from any certificate of approval relate only to taxable profits attributable to the specific Approved Enterprise.\nIncome derived from activity that is not approved by the Investment Center or not integral to the activity of the Approved Enterprise\ndoes not enjoy tax benefits.\nTax Benefits Subsequent to the 2005 Amendment\nThe 2005 Amendment changed certain provisions of the Investment Law. As a result of the 2005 Amendment, a company\nreferred to as a “Beneficiary Enterprise”, was no longer obligated to obtain Approved Enterprise status in order to receive the tax benefits\npreviously available under the Alternative Track, and therefore generally there was no need to apply to the Investment Center for this\npurpose (Approved Enterprise status remains mandatory for companies seeking cash grants).\n- 90 -\nTrapped Earnings\nOn November 15, 2021, a new amendment to the Investment Law, or the Investment Law Amendment, was approved,\nintroducing a new dividend distribution ordering rule to cause the distribution of earnings that were tax exempt under the historical\nApproved or Beneficial Enterprise regimes, or Trapped Earnings, to be on a pro-rata basis from any dividend distribution. The\nInvestment Law Amendment is applicable to distributions starting from August 15, 2021 onwards. Therefore, the corporate income tax,\nor CIT, claw-back will apply upon any dividend distribution, as long as the Company has Trapped Earnings.\nTax Benefits under the 2011 and 2017 Amendments\nThe 2011 Amendment canceled the availability of the benefits granted to companies under the Investment Law prior to 2011\nand, instead, introduced new benefits for income generated by a “Preferred Company” through its “Preferred Enterprise” (as such terms\nare defined in the Investment Law) as of January 1, 2011. A Preferred Company is an industrial company owning a Preferred Enterprise\nwhich meets certain conditions (including a minimum threshold of 25% export). However, under this new legislation the requirement\nfor a minimum investment in productive assets was cancelled.\nPursuant to the 2011 Amendment, a Preferred Company is entitled to a reduced corporate tax rate of 16% in 2014, unless the\nPreferred Company is located in a certain development zone, in which case the rate will be 9%. Pursuant to the 2017 Amendment, in\n2017 and thereafter, a Preferred Company is entitled to a reduced corporate tax rate of 16% and 7.5%, respectively.\nDividends paid out of income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise during 2014 and thereafter are generally subject to\nwithholding tax at the rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty. However, if such dividends are\npaid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to be withheld (however, if afterward distributed to individuals or non-Israeli company a\nwithholding of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty, will apply).\nThe 2011 Amendment also provided transitional provisions to address companies already enjoying existing tax benefits under\nthe Investment Law. These transitional provisions provide, among other things, that unless an irrevocable request is made to apply the\nprovisions of the Investment Law as amended in 2011 with respect to income to be derived as of January 1, 2011: (i) the terms and\nbenefits included in any certificate of approval that was granted to an Approved Enterprise which chose to receive grants and certain tax\nbenefits under the Grant Track before the 2011 Amendment became effective will remain subject to the provisions of the Investment\nLaw as in effect on the date of such approval, and subject to certain conditions; and (ii) terms and benefits included in any certificate of\napproval that was granted to an Approved Enterprise under the Alternative Track before the 2011 Amendment became effective will\nremain subject to the provisions of the Investment Law as in effect on the date of such approval, provided that certain conditions are\nmet; and (iii) a Beneficiary Enterprise can elect to continue to benefit from the benefits provided to it before the 2011 Amendment came\ninto effect, provided that certain conditions are met.\nIn May 2019, we notified the Israel Tax Authority that we waived our Beneficiary Enterprise status starting from the 2019 tax\nyear and thereafter.\nThe 2017 Amendment provides new tax tracks for a “Preferred Technological Enterprise”– an enterprise for which total\nconsolidated revenues of its parent company and all subsidiaries are less than NIS 10 billion for a tax year. Under the law, a Preferred\nTechnological Enterprise, which is located in the center of Israel will be subject to tax at a rate of 12% on profits being derived from\nintellectual property and “Preferred Technological Enterprise” which is located in development area A will be subject to tax rate of\n7.5%. In addition, a “Preferred Technological Enterprise” will receive a reduced corporate tax rate of 12% on capital gains derived from\nthe sale of certain “Benefitted Intangible Assets” (as defined in the Investment Law) to a related foreign company if (i) the Benefitted\nIntangible Assets were acquired from a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017 for at least NIS 200 million, and (ii) such sale\nreceives prior approval from the IIA. However, the proportion of income that may be considered Preferred Technological Income and\nreceive the tax benefits described immediately above is calculated according to a nexus formula, which is based on the proportion of\nqualifying expenditures on intellectual property compared to overall expenditures.\n- 91 -\nThe 2017 Amendment further provides that a Preferred Company with group consolidated revenues of at least NIS 10 billion\nwill qualify as a “Special Preferred Technological Enterprise” and will receive a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on “Preferred\nTechnological Income” regardless of the company’s geographic location within Israel. In addition, a “Special Preferred Technological\nEnterprise” will receive a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on capital gains derived from the sale of certain “Benefitted Intangible\nAssets” to a related foreign company if (i) the Benefitted Intangible Assets were either developed by the Special Preferred Enterprise or\nacquired from a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017, and (ii) such sale received prior approval from the IIA. A “Special\nPreferred Technological Enterprise” that acquires Benefitted Intangible Assets from a foreign company for more than NIS 500 million\nwill be eligible for these benefits for at least 10 years, subject to the receipt of certain approvals as specified in the Investment Law.\nDividends paid out of Preferred Technological Income, which are distributed by a Preferred Technological Enterprise or a\n“Special Preferred Technological Enterprise,” are generally subject to tax at the rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in\nan applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the ITA allowing for a reduced tax rate). However,\nif such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to be withheld. If such dividends are distributed to a foreign company\nthat holds solely or together with other foreign companies 90% or more of the Israeli company and other conditions are satisfied, the\ntax rate will be 4%. However, dividends paid out to natural persons may be subject to an additional surtax of 3%, as described below.\nWe are eligible for tax benefits as a Preferred Technological Enterprise mentioned above and the changes in the tax rates\nrelating to Preferred Technological Enterprises were taken into account in the computation of deferred taxes as of December 31, 2023.\nTax Benefits and Funding for Research and Development\nIsraeli tax law allows, under specific conditions, a tax deduction for expenditures, including capital expenditures, relating to\nscientific research and development projects, for the year in which they are incurred if:\n• the expenditures are approved by the relevant Israeli government ministry, determined by the field of research;\n• the research and development is for the promotion or development of the company; and\n• the research and development is carried out by or on behalf of the company seeking the deduction.\nHowever, the amount of such deductible expenses shall be reduced by the sum of any funds received through government\ngrants for the finance of such scientific research and development projects. Under these research and development deduction rules, no\ndeduction is allowed for any expense invested in an asset depreciable under the general depreciation rules of the Israeli Income Tax\nOrdinance. Expenditures not so approved are deductible over a three-year period in equal amounts if the research and development is\nfor the promotion or development of the company.\nLaw for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969, or the Industry Encouragement Law\nThe Industry Encouragement Law, provides several tax benefits for “Industrial Companies.” We currently qualify as an\nIndustrial Company within the meaning of the Industry Encouragement Law.\nThe Industry Encouragement Law defines an “Industrial Company” as a company resident in Israel, of which 90% or more of\nits income in any tax year, other than income from defense loans, is derived from an “Industrial Enterprise” owned by it and located in\nIsrael. An “Industrial Enterprise” is defined as an enterprise whose principal activity in a given tax year is industrial production.\nThe following corporate tax benefits, among others, are available to Industrial Companies:\n• amortization over an eight-year period of the cost of purchased know-how and patents and rights to use a patent and\nknow-how which are used for the development or advancement of the company;\n• under limited conditions, an election to file consolidated tax returns with related Israeli Industrial Companies; and\n• expenses related to a public offering are deductible in equal amounts over a three-year period.\n- 92 -\nEligibility for benefits under the Industry Encouragement Law is not contingent upon the approval of any governmental\nauthority. The Israeli tax authorities may determine that we do not qualify as an Industrial Company, which could entail our loss of the\nbenefits that relate to this status. There can be no assurance that we will continue to qualify as an Industrial Company or that the benefits\ndescribed above will be available in the future.\nTaxation of our Shareholders\nCapital Gains Taxes Applicable to Non-Israeli Resident Shareholders. A non-Israeli resident who derives capital gains from\nthe sale of shares in an Israeli resident company that were purchased after the company was listed for trading on a stock exchange outside\nof Israel will be exempt from Israeli tax so long as the shares were not held through a permanent establishment that the non-resident\nmaintains in Israel. However, non-Israeli corporations will not be entitled to the foregoing exemption if Israeli residents: (i) have a\ncontrolling interest of more than 25% in such non-Israeli corporation or (ii) are the beneficiaries of, or are entitled to, 25% or more of\nthe revenues or profits of such non-Israeli corporation, whether directly or indirectly. Additionally, such exemption is not applicable to\na person whose gains from selling or otherwise disposing of the shares are deemed to be business income.\nAdditionally, a sale of securities by a non-Israeli resident may be exempt from Israeli capital gains tax under the provisions of\nan applicable tax treaty. For example, under the United States-Israel Tax Treaty, the disposition of shares by a shareholder who is a\nUnited States resident (for purposes of the treaty) holding the shares as a capital asset is generally exempt from Israeli capital gains tax\nunless, among other things, (i) the capital gain arising from the disposition is attributed to business income derived by a permanent\nestablishment of the shareholder in Israel; (ii) the shareholder holds, directly or indirectly, shares representing 10% or more of the voting\ncapital during any part of the 12-month period preceding the disposition; or (iii) such U.S. resident is an individual and was present in\nIsrael for 183 days or more in the aggregate during the relevant taxable year.\nIn some instances where our shareholders may be liable for Israeli tax on the sale of their ordinary shares, the payment of the\nconsideration may be subject to the withholding of Israeli tax at source.\nTaxation of Non-Israeli Shareholders on Receipt of Dividends. Non-Israeli residents (whether individuals or corporations)\ngenerally will be subject to Israeli income tax on the receipt of dividends paid on our ordinary shares at the rate of 25%, which tax will\nbe withheld at source, unless relief is provided in a treaty between Israel and the shareholder’s country of residence (subject to the receipt\nin advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority allowing for a reduced tax rate). With respect to a person who is a\n“substantial shareholder” at the time of receiving the dividend or on any time during the preceding twelve months, the applicable tax\nrate is 30%. A “substantial shareholder” is generally a person who alone or together with such person’s relative or another person who\ncollaborates with such person on a permanent basis, holds, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any of the “means of control” of the\ncorporation. “Means of control” generally include the right to vote, receive profits, nominate a director or an executive officer, receive\nassets upon liquidation, or order someone who holds any of the aforesaid rights how to act, regardless of the source of such right. Such\ndividends are generally subject to Israeli withholding tax at a rate of 25% so long as the shares are registered with a nominee company\n(whether the recipient is a substantial shareholder or not).\nHowever, a distribution of dividends to non-Israeli residents is subject to withholding tax at source at a rate of 15% if the\ndividend is distributed from income attributed to an Approved Enterprise or Beneficiary Enterprise, unless a reduced tax rate is provided\nunder an applicable tax treaty. If the dividend is being paid out of certain income attributable to a Preferred Technological Enterprise,\nthe dividend will be subject to tax at the rate of 20%. A different rate may be provided in a treaty between Israel and the shareholder’s\ncountry of residence, as mentioned below.\n- 93 -\nIn this regard, under the United States-Israel Tax Treaty, the maximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on dividends\npaid to a holder of our ordinary shares who is a United States resident (for purposes of the United States-Israel Tax Treaty) is 25%.\nHowever, generally, the maximum rate of withholding tax on dividends, not generated by an Approved Enterprise, or Beneficiary\nEnterprise or a Preferred Technological Enterprise, that are paid to a United States corporation holding 10% or more of the outstanding\nvoting capital throughout the tax year in which the dividend is distributed as well as during the previous tax year, is 12.5%, provided\nthat not more than 25% of the gross income for such preceding year consists of certain types of dividends and interest. If the above\nconditions are met and the dividends are generated by an Approved Enterprise, or Beneficiary Enterprise or a Preferred Technological\nEnterprise, the maximum rate of withholding tax on such dividends is 15%. If the dividend is attributable partly to income derived from\nApproved Enterprise, Beneficiary Enterprise or a Preferred Technological Enterprise, and partly to other sources of income, the\nwithholding rate will be a blended rate reflecting the relative portions of the two types of income. We cannot assure you that we will\ndesignate the profits that we may distribute in a way that will reduce shareholders’ tax liability.\nSurtax\nIndividuals who are subject to tax in Israel (whether or not Israeli residents) are subject to a surtax at a rate of 3% of annual\ntaxable income in excess of NIS 721,560 (for the 2024 tax year, which amount is linked to the annual change in the Israeli consumer\nprice index), including, but not limited to, dividends, interest and capital gain.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following summary describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to “U.S. Holders” (as defined below)\narising from the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares. This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, or the “Code,” the final, temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and\nadministrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change (possibly with\nretroactive effect) or different interpretations. For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” will be deemed to refer only to any of the\nfollowing beneficial owners of our ordinary shares:\n• an individual who is either a U.S. citizen or a resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n• a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or\nunder the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof;\n• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of the source of its income; and\n• a trust, if (a) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more\nU.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (b) the trust has a valid election in\neffect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\n- 94 -\nThis summary does not consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to particular U.S. Holders by\nreason of their particular circumstances, and does not consider the potential application of the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative\nminimum tax, or any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. federal tax laws or U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws.\nIn addition, this summary is directed only to U.S. Holders that hold our ordinary shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of\nSection 1221 of the Code and does not address the considerations that may be applicable to particular classes of U.S. Holders, including\nU.S. expatriates, banks, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, pension funds, insurance\ncompanies, broker-dealers or traders in securities, commodities or currencies, tax-exempt organizations, grantor trusts, partnerships\n(including entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or other pass-through entities, persons that will hold\nour ordinary shares in partnerships or other pass-through entities, holders whose functional currency is not the dollar, holders who have\nelected mark-to-market accounting, holders who acquired our ordinary shares through the exercise of options or otherwise as\ncompensation for the performance of services, holders who hold our ordinary shares as part of a “straddle,” “hedge” or “conversion\ntransaction,” holders selling our ordinary shares short, holders deemed to have sold our ordinary shares in a “constructive sale,” holders\nrequired to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to our ordinary shares as a result of such income being\nrecognized on an applicable financial statement, holders that are resident or ordinarily resident in or have a permanent establishment in\na jurisdiction outside the United States; and holders, directly, indirectly or through attribution, of 10% or more (by vote or value) of our\noutstanding ordinary shares. If a partnership (or any other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our\nordinary shares, the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to an investment in our ordinary shares will depend in part upon the\nstatus of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our ordinary shares in its particular circumstances.\nEach U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisor as to the particular tax consequences to it of the acquisition,\nownership and disposition of our ordinary shares, including the effects of applicable tax treaties, state, local, foreign or other tax\nlaws and possible changes in the tax laws.\nDistributions With Respect to Our Ordinary Shares\nIn the event we make a distribution with respect to our ordinary shares, subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company Status,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the distribution will equal the dollar value of the\ngross amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any property distributed, including the amount of any Israeli taxes withheld on such\ndistribution as described above under “Israeli Tax Considerations – Taxation of Non-Israeli Shareholders on Receipt of Dividends.”\nOther than distributions in liquidation or in redemption of our ordinary shares that are treated as exchanges, a distribution with respect\nto our ordinary shares to a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of any distribution that exceeds these earnings and profits will\nbe treated first as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its ordinary shares (but not below zero), and\nthen generally as capital gain from a deemed sale or exchange of such ordinary shares. However, because we do not account for our\nearnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles, U.S. Holders should expect all distributions to be reported\nto them as dividends. Corporate U.S. Holders generally will not be allowed a deduction under Section 243 of the Code for dividends\nreceived on our ordinary shares and thus will be subject to tax at the rate applicable to their taxable income.\nCurrently, a non-corporate U.S. Holder’s “qualified dividend income” generally is subject to tax at lower long-term capital\ngains rates. For this purpose, “qualified dividend income” generally includes dividends paid by a foreign corporation if, among other\nthings, the non-corporate U.S. Holder meets certain minimum holding period requirements, is not under an obligation to make related\npayments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property, and either (a) the stock of such corporation is readily\ntradable on an established securities market in the U.S., including the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or (b) such corporation is eligible\nfor the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that includes an information exchange program and is\ndetermined to be satisfactory by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury has indicated that the income\ntax treaty between the United States and Israel is satisfactory for this purpose. Dividends paid by us will not be treated as qualified\ndividend income, however, if we are treated, for the tax year in which the dividends are paid or the preceding tax year, as a “passive\nforeign investment company” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the discussion below under the heading “Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company Status.”\n- 95 -\nA non-corporate U.S. Holder may be subject to an additional tax based on its “net investment income,” (which generally is\ncomputed as gross income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties and rents and gain from the sale of property (other than property\nheld in the active conduct of a trade or business that does not regularly trade financial instruments or commodities), less the amount of\ndeductions properly allocable to such income or gain. Such tax is equal to 3.8% of the lesser of an individual U.S. Holder’s (i) net\ninvestment income or (ii) the excess of such U.S. Holder’s “modified adjusted gross income” (adjusted gross income plus the amount\nof any foreign earned income excluded from income under Section 911(a)(1) of the Code, net of deductions and exclusions disallowed\nwith respect to such foreign earned income) over a specified threshold amount ($250,000 in the case of a joint return or surviving spouse,\n$125,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return and $200,000 in any other case). In the case of a U.S. Holder which\nis an estate or trust, the tax is equal to 3.8% of the lesser of (i) undistributed net investment income or (ii) the excess of adjusted gross\nincome (as defined in Section 67(e) of the Code) over the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust\nbegins.\nU.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of their receipt\nof any distributions with respect to our ordinary shares.\nA dividend paid by us in NIS will be included in the income of U.S. Holders at the dollar amount of the dividend, based on the\n“spot rate” of exchange in effect on the date of receipt or deemed receipt of the dividend, regardless of whether the payment is in fact\nconverted into dollars. U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in the NIS for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to that dollar value. Any\ngain or loss upon the subsequent conversion of the NIS into dollars or other disposition of the NIS will constitute foreign currency gain\nor loss taxable as ordinary income or loss and will be treated as U.S.-source income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.\nDividends received with respect to our ordinary shares will constitute “portfolio income” for purposes of the limitation on the\ndeductibility of passive activity losses and, therefore, generally may not be offset by passive activity losses. Dividends received with\nrespect to our ordinary shares also generally will be treated as “investment income” for purposes of the investment interest deduction\nlimitation contained in Section 163(d) of the Code, and generally as foreign-source passive income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.\nSubject to certain limitations, U.S. Holders may elect to claim as a foreign tax credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability for\nany Israeli income tax withheld from distributions with respect to our ordinary shares which constitute dividends under U.S. income tax\nlaw. A U.S. Holder that does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit may instead claim a deduction for Israeli income tax withheld, but\nonly if the U.S. Holder elects to do so with respect to all foreign income taxes in such year. If a refund of the tax withheld is available\nunder the applicable laws of Israel or under the Israel-U.S. income tax treaty, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be\neligible for such credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability (and will not be eligible for the deduction against your U.S. federal\ntaxable income). In addition, special rules may apply to the computation of foreign tax credits relating to “qualified dividend income,”\nas defined above. The calculation of foreign tax credits and, in the case of a U.S. Holder that elects to deduct foreign income taxes, the\navailability of deductions involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S.\nHolders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability to them of foreign tax credits or deductions in respect of\nany Israeli tax withheld or paid with respect to any dividends which may be paid with respect to our ordinary shares, including limitations\npursuant to the U.S.-Israel income tax treaty.\nHowever, if we are a “United States-owned foreign corporation,” solely for foreign tax credit purposes, a portion of the\ndividends allocable to our U.S. source earnings and profits may be recharacterized as U.S. source. A “United States-owned foreign\ncorporation” is any foreign corporation in which United States persons own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more (by vote or by value)\nof the stock. In general, United States-owned foreign corporations with less than 10% of earnings and profits attributable to sources\nwithin the United States are excepted from these rules. In such case, if 10% or more of our earnings and profits are attributable to sources\nwithin the United States, a portion of the dividends paid on our ordinary shares allocable to our U.S. source earnings and profits will be\ntreated as U.S. source, and, as such, a U.S. Holder may not offset any foreign tax withheld as a credit against U.S. federal income tax\nimposed on that portion of dividends. The rules governing the treatment of foreign taxes imposed on a U.S. Holder and foreign tax\ncredits are complex, and each U.S. Holder should consult their respective tax advisor about the impact of these rules in their particular\nsituation.\n- 96 -\nDisposition of Our Ordinary Shares\nSubject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Status,” a U.S. Holder’s sale, exchange or other\ntaxable disposition of our ordinary shares generally will result in the recognition by such U.S. Holder of capital gain or loss in an amount\nequal to the difference between the dollar value of the amount realized and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares disposed\nof (measured in dollars). This gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if such ordinary shares have been held or are deemed to\nhave been held for more than one year at the time of the disposition. Non-corporate U.S. Holders currently are subject to a maximum\ntax rate of 20% on long-term capital gains, also may be subject to the additional tax on “net investment income” described above in\n“Distributions With Respect to Our Ordinary Shares.” If the U.S. Holder’s holding period on the date of the taxable disposition is\none year or less, such gain or loss will be a short-term capital gain or loss. Short-term capital gains generally are taxed at the same rates\napplicable to ordinary income. See “Israeli Tax Considerations – Capital Gains Taxes Applicable to Non-Israeli Resident Shareholders”\nfor a discussion of taxation by Israel of capital gains realized on sales of our ordinary shares. Any capital loss realized upon the taxable\ndisposition of our ordinary shares generally will be deductible only against capital gains and not against ordinary income, except that\nnon-corporate U.S. Holders generally may deduct annually from ordinary income up to $3,000 of net capital losses. In general, any\ncapital gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder upon the taxable disposition of our ordinary shares will be treated as U.S.-source income\nor loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, although the tax treaty between the United States and Israel may permit gain derived from\nthe taxable disposition of ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder to be treated as foreign-source income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes\nunder certain circumstances.\nA U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its ordinary shares generally will be equal to the dollar purchase price paid by such U.S. Holder to\nacquire such ordinary shares. The dollar cost of ordinary shares purchased with foreign currency generally will be equal to the dollar\nvalue of the purchase price on the date of purchase or, in the case of ordinary shares that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or\nan accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects), on the settlement date for the purchase. Such an election by an accrual basis U.S. Holder\nmust be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The\nholding period of each ordinary share owned by a U.S. Holder will commence on the day following the date of the U.S. Holder’s\npurchase of such ordinary share and will include the day on which the ordinary share is sold by such U.S. Holder.\nIn the case of a U.S. Holder who uses the cash basis method of accounting and who receives NIS in connection with a taxable\ndisposition of ordinary shares, the amount realized will be based on the “spot rate” of exchange on the settlement date of such taxable\ndisposition. If such U.S. Holder subsequently converts NIS into dollars at a conversion rate other than the spot rate in effect on the\nsettlement date, such U.S. Holder may have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss treated as ordinary income or loss for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. A U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting may elect the same treatment required of cash method\ntaxpayers with respect to a taxable disposition of ordinary shares, provided that the election is applied consistently from year to year.\nSuch election may not be changed without the consent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. If an accrual method U.S. Holder does not\n(or is not eligible to) elect to be treated as a cash method taxpayer (pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations applicable to foreign currency\ntransactions), such U.S. Holder may be deemed to have realized an immediate foreign currency gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes in the event of any difference between the dollar value of the NIS on the date of the taxable disposition and the settlement date.\nAny such currency gain or loss generally would be treated as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss and would be subject to tax in addition\nto any gain or loss recognized by such U.S. Holder on the taxable disposition of ordinary shares.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Status\nGenerally, a foreign corporation is treated as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes for any tax year if, in such tax year, either (i) 75% or more of its gross income (including its pro rata share of the gross income\nof any company in which it is considered to own 25% or more of the shares by value) is passive in nature, or the Income Test, or (ii) the\naverage percentage of its assets during such tax year (including its pro rata share of the assets of any company in which it is considered\nto own 25% or more of the shares by value) which produce, or are held for the production of, passive income (determined by averaging\nthe percentage of the fair market value of its total assets which are passive assets as of the end of each quarter of such year) is 50% or\nmore, or the Asset Test. Passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends, interest, rents, royalties and gains from securities\nand commodities transactions. Cash is treated as generating passive income.\n- 97 -\nThere is no definitive method prescribed in the Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations or relevant administrative or judicial\ninterpretations for determining the value of a publicly traded foreign corporation’s assets for purposes of the Asset Test. The legislative\nhistory of the U.S. Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, or the 1997 Act, indicates that for purposes of the Asset Test, “the total value of a\npublicly traded foreign corporation’s assets generally will be treated as equal to the sum of the aggregate value of its outstanding stock\nplus its liabilities.” It is unclear whether other valuation methods could be employed to determine the value of a publicly traded foreign\ncorporation’s assets for purposes of the Asset Test.\nWe must make a separate determination each taxable year as to whether we are a PFIC. As a result, our PFIC status may change\nfrom year to year. Based on the composition of our gross income and the composition and value of our gross assets for each taxable year\nfrom 2004 through 2020, we do not believe that we were a PFIC during any of such tax years. It is likely, however, that under the asset\nvaluation method described in the legislative history of the 1997 Act, we would have been classified as a PFIC for each of 2001, 2002\nand 2003 primarily because (a) a significant portion of our assets consisted of the remaining proceeds of our two public offerings of\nordinary shares in 1999, and (b) the public market valuation of our ordinary shares during such years was relatively low. There can be\nno assurance that we will not be deemed a PFIC for the current tax year or any future tax year in which, for example, the value of our\nassets, as measured by the public market valuation of our ordinary shares, declines in relation to the value of our passive assets (generally,\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities). If we are treated as a PFIC with respect to a U.S. Holder for any tax year, the U.S.\nHolder will be deemed to own ordinary shares in any of our subsidiaries that are also PFICs.\nIf we are treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any year during a U.S. Holder’s holding period of our\nordinary shares and the U.S. Holder does not make a QEF Election or a “mark-to-market” election (both as described below), the U.S.\nHolder would be subject to the following rules:\n(i) the U.S. Holder would be required to (a) report as ordinary income any “excess distributions” (as defined below)\nallocated to the current tax year and any period prior to the first day of the first tax year in which we were a PFIC,\n(b) pay tax on amounts allocated to each prior tax year in which we were a PFIC at the highest rate for individuals or\ncorporations as appropriate in effect for such prior year, and (c) pay an interest charge on the tax due for prior tax years\nin which we were a PFIC at the rate applicable to deficiencies of U.S. federal income tax. “Excess distributions” with\nrespect to any U.S. Holder are amounts received by such U.S. Holder with respect to our ordinary shares in any\ntax year that exceed 125% of the average distributions received by such U.S. Holder from us during the shorter of\n(i) the three previous years, or (ii) such U.S. Holder’s holding period of our ordinary shares before the then-current\ntax year. Excess distributions must be allocated ratably to each day that a U.S. Holder has held our ordinary shares;\nand\n(ii) the entire amount of any gain realized by the U.S. Holder upon the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares also\nwould be treated as an “excess distribution” subject to tax as described above.\nIf we are a PFIC for any tax year in which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares, we generally will continue to be treated as\na PFIC as to such U.S. Holder for all subsequent years during the U.S. Holder’s holding period unless we cease to be a PFIC and the\nU.S. Holder elects to recognize gain based on the unrealized appreciation in such U.S. Holder’s ordinary shares through the close of the\ntax year in which we cease to be a PFIC. Thereafter, so long as we do not again become a PFIC, such U.S. Holder’s ordinary shares for\nwhich an election was made will not be treated as shares in a PFIC.\nA U.S. Holder who beneficially owns shares of a PFIC must file U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 8621 (Return by a\nShareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund) with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service annually.\nFor any tax year in which we are treated as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder may elect to treat its ordinary shares as an interest in a\nqualified electing fund, or a QEF Election, in which case the U.S. Holder would be required to include in income currently its\nproportionate share of our earnings and profits in years in which we are a PFIC regardless of whether distributions of our earnings and\nprofits are actually made to the U.S. Holder. Any gain subsequently recognized by the U.S. Holder upon the sale or other disposition of\nits ordinary shares, however, generally would be taxed as capital gain.\n- 98 -\nA U.S. Holder may make a QEF Election with respect to a PFIC for any tax year. The election is effective for the tax year for\nwhich it is made and all subsequent tax years of the U.S. Holder. Procedures exist for both retroactive elections and the filing of\nprotective statements. A QEF Election is made by completing U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 8621 and attaching it to a timely\nfiled (including extensions) U.S. federal income tax return for the first tax year to which the election will apply. A U.S. Holder must\nsatisfy additional filing requirements each year the election remains in effect. Upon a U.S. Holder’s request, we will provide to such\nU.S. Holder the information required to make a QEF Election and to make subsequent annual filings.\nAs an alternative to a QEF Election, a U.S. Holder generally may elect to mark its ordinary shares to market annually,\nrecognizing ordinary income or loss (subject to certain limitations) equal to the difference, as of the close of each tax year, between the\nfair market value of its ordinary shares and the adjusted tax basis of such shares. A U.S. Holder will be allowed a deduction for the\nexcess, if any, of the adjusted basis of its ordinary shares over their fair market value as of the close of the taxable year. However,\ndeductions will be allowable only to the extent of any net mark-to-market gains on our ordinary shares included in the U.S. Holder’s\nincome for prior taxable years. Amounts included in a U.S. Holder’s income under a mark-to-market election, as well as gain on the\nactual sale or other disposition of ordinary shares, will be treated as ordinary income. Ordinary loss treatment will also apply to the\ndeductible portion of any mark-to-market loss on ordinary shares, as well as to any loss realized on the actual sale or disposition of\nordinary shares, to the extent the amount of such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains for such ordinary shares previously\nincluded in income. A U.S. Holder’s basis in our ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts. If a U.S.\nHolder makes a mark-to-market election, any distributions we make would generally be subject to the rules discussed above under “—\nDistributions With Respect to Our Ordinary Shares,” except the lower rates applicable to qualified dividend income would not apply.\nOnce made, a mark-to-market election generally continues unless revoked with the consent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for “marketable stock,” which is stock that is regularly traded on a qualified\nexchange or other market, as defined in applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Our ordinary shares are traded on Nasdaq and TASE.\nBecause a mark-to-market election cannot be made for equity interests in any lower-tier PFICs we own, a U.S. Holder generally will\ncontinue to be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to its indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated as an equity\ninterest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Nasdaq is a qualified exchange, and we believe TASE should be treated as a\nqualified exchange but there can be no assurance that the trading in our ordinary shares will be sufficiently regular to qualify our ordinary\nshares as marketable stock. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisor as to the availability and desirability of a mark-to-market\nelection, as well as the impact of such election on interests in any lower-tier PFICs.\nEach U.S. person that is an investor of a PFIC is generally required to file an annual information return on IRS Form 8621\ncontaining such information as the U.S. Treasury Department may require. The failure to file IRS Form 8621 could result in the\nimposition of penalties and the extension of the statute of limitations with respect to U.S. federal income tax.\nDue to the complexity of the PFIC rules and the uncertainty of their application in many circumstances, U.S. Holders\nshould consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax risks related to owning and disposing of our ordinary\nshares, the consequence of our status as a PFIC and, if we are treated as a PFIC, compliance with the applicable reporting\nrequirements and the eligibility, manner and advisability of making a QEF Election or a mark-to-market election.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments in respect of our ordinary shares that are made in the United States or by certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries\nmay be subject to information reporting requirements and U.S. backup withholding tax, currently at a rate of 24%. The information\nreporting requirements will not apply, however, to payments to certain exempt U.S. Holders, including corporations and tax-exempt\norganizations. In addition, backup withholding will not apply to a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number\non U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or substitute form) or establishes an exemption. The backup withholding tax is not an\nadditional tax. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules may be credited against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income\ntax liability, and a U.S. Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules by timely\nfiling the appropriate claim for refund with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors\nregarding their qualification for an exemption from the backup withholding tax and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if\napplicable.\n- 99 -\nForeign Asset Reporting\nA U.S. Holder with interests in “specified foreign financial assets” (including, among other assets, our ordinary shares, unless\nsuch ordinary shares are held on such U.S. Holder’s behalf through a financial institution) may be required to file an information report\nwith the U.S. Internal Revenue Service if the aggregate value of all such assets exceeds $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year or\n$75,000 at any time during the taxable year (or such higher dollar amount as may be prescribed by applicable U.S. Internal Revenue\nService guidance). Regulations extend this reporting requirement to certain entities that are treated as formed or availed of to hold direct\nor indirect interests in specified foreign financial assets based on certain objective criteria. A U.S. Holder that fails to report the required\ninformation could be subject to substantial penalties. Each U.S. Holders should consult with its own tax advisor regarding its obligation\nto file such information reports in light of its own particular circumstances.\nThe foregoing discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations is a general summary only and should not be\nconsidered as income tax advice or relied upon for tax planning purposes. Accordingly, each U.S. Holder should consult with its\nown tax advisor regarding U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership\nand disposition of our ordinary shares.\nF.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks,\nwe use derivative financial instruments. The majority of our revenues and expenses are generated in dollars. A portion of our expenses,\nhowever, is denominated in NIS. In order to protect ourselves against the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign\nexchange rates, we use currency forward contracts and currency options. We usually hedge the part of our forecasted expenses\ndenominated in NIS. If our currency forward contracts and currency options meet the definition of a hedge, and are so designated,\nchanges in the fair value of the contracts will be offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities through\nearnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the\nperiod of change. Our hedging program reduces, but does not eliminate, the impact of foreign currency rate movements and due to the\ngeneral economic slowdown along with the devaluation of the dollar, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Without taking\ninto account the mitigating effect of our hedging activity, a 10% decrease in the dollar exchange rates in effect for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2023 would cause a decrease in net income of approximately $8.1 million.\n- 100 -\nITEM 12.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance and Chief\nFinancial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in 13a-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct) as of December 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President Finance and\nChief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were (i) designed to ensure that\nmaterial information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our management, including our President\nand Chief Executive Officer and Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer, by others within those entities, as appropriate to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, particularly during the period in which this report was being prepared and\n(ii) effective, in that they provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or\nsubmit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and\nforms.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, under the supervision of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance and Chief\nFinancial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in\nRules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our\nmanagement and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and\nprocedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of our records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and\nasset dispositions;\n• provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of our financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;\n• provide reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of\nour management and board of directors (as appropriate); and\n- 101 -\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal\nfinancial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2023 based on the framework for Internal Control – Integrated Framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO). Based on our assessment under that framework and the criteria established\ntherein, our management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis Annual Report includes an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over\nfinancial reporting on page F-3 of our audited consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 18, “Financial Statements,” and is\nincorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified with the evaluation thereof that occurred\nduring the period covered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nITEM 16.

Each of the approvals received in 2023\nallowed us to use the approved amounts for share repurchases or cash dividends. The Israeli court generally limits its approval to\nsix months from the date of application. Consequently, although the program does not have a set end date, it requires renewal each\nsix months by submitting new court application based on the then prevailing facts. No shares were repurchased during 2023 other\nthan through the repurchase program.\n(2) Excluding commissions.\n(3) In March 2023, we paid a cash dividend in the aggregate amount of $5.7 million.\n(4) In August 2023, we paid a cash dividend in the aggregate amount of $5.7 million.\nITEM 16.F. CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFIED ACCOUNTANT\nNot applicable.\nITEM 16.G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAs a foreign private issuer whose shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we are permitted to follow certain\nhome country corporate governance practices instead of certain requirements of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules.\nWe do not comply with the Nasdaq requirement that we obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as for the\nestablishment or amendment of certain share-based compensation plans (including amendments to increase the number of shares\navailable for grant under our existing equity incentive plan). Instead, we follow Israeli law and practice which permits the establishment\nor amendment of certain share-based compensation plans approved by our board of directors without the need for a shareholder vote,\nunless such arrangements are for the compensation of directors and the chief executive officer, in which case they also require\ncompensation committee and shareholder approval.\n- 104 -\nWe may elect in the future to follow Israeli practice with regard to, among other things, director nomination, composition of\nthe board of directors and quorum at shareholders’ meetings. In addition, we may follow Israeli law, instead of the Nasdaq Marketplace\nRules, which require that we obtain shareholder approval for an issuance that will result in a change of control of the company, certain\ntransactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in the company and certain acquisitions of the\nstock or assets of another company.\nA foreign private issuer that elects to follow a home country practice instead of Nasdaq requirements must submit to Nasdaq\nin advance a written statement from an independent counsel in its home country certifying that its practices are not prohibited by the\nhome country’s laws. In addition, a foreign private issuer must disclose in its annual reports filed with the SEC or on its website each\nsuch requirement that it does not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the issuer instead of any such requirement.\nAccordingly, our shareholders may not be afforded the same protection as provided under Nasdaq’s corporate governance rules.\nFor a discussion of the requirements of Israeli law with respect to these matters, see Item 6.C, “Directors, Senior Management\nand Employees- Board Practices,” and Item 10.B, “Additional Information-Memorandum and Articles of Association.”\nITEM 16.H.

INSIDER TRADING POLICIES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 16.K. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk management and strategy\nWe have a cybersecurity program for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, and we\nmonitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, as applicable. We believe our cybersecurity\nprogram is reasonably designed to materially protect the security of our data and the data in our possession. Our policies and procedures\naddress security governance, security awareness and training, access management, vulnerability management, penetration testing,\nsecurity monitoring and incident response. In addition, our employees regularly undergo continuing cybersecurity training, and\nemployees in higher-risk functions receive additional training and cybersecurity awareness education. Audits, cybersecurity simulations\nand employee testing results indicate that our program is effective in protecting our information. We also engage regularly with third\nparties to evaluate the strength of our program through penetration testing, vulnerability testing and mock phishing campaigns to identify\nand mitigate risks. We have policies and processes to govern third-party access and reduce the risks associated with such access. In\ngeneral, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a comprehensive, cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the\nconfidentiality, security and availability of the information that we collect and store by identifying, preventing and mitigating\ncybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.\nAudioCodes’ risk management and strategy is based on the following principles:\n• Risk management is a continuous, cyclical process that involves six steps: (1) establishing context; (2) identifying and\ndescribing risks; (3) quantifying and assessing risks; (4) taking action to control risks; (5) monitoring and reviewing\nrisks; (6), and communicating and consulting about risks; and\n• Risk management is a key organizational responsibility that aims to identify and control all risks that might have an\nimpact on the organization's objectives, its employees, and the people it interacts with.\n- 105 -\n• Risk management is a good management practice and central to the effective running of the organization. AudioCodes\nwill seek to ensure that any decisions made on behalf of the organization are taken with due consideration of the\neffective management of risks.\n• Risk management is supported by an annual external audit and review of governance, risk management, and internal\ncontrols, as well as regular internal audits and reports.\n• AudioCodes shall seek to implement the information security controls as detailed in its work plan and risk assessment\ntable.\n• AudioCodes has assigned clear roles and responsibilities for risk management to its senior management, the CISO, its\nemployees and its contractors.\nOur systems face cybersecurity risks, and although such risks have not to date materially affected, and we do not believe they\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, us, our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, we may, from time to\ntime, experience threats to and security incidents related to our data and systems. We can provide no assurance that we will not\nexperience any material cybersecurity threats or incidents in the future. See Item 3.D, “Key Information – Risk Factors – A data security\nor privacy breach could adversely affect our business and services.”\nCorporate governance\nUnder the ultimate direction of our Chief Information Officer, or the CIO, our CIO has primary responsibility for day-to-day\nmanagement of our cybersecurity risk management program, including leading a dedicated team of technology professionals to monitor\ncybersecurity risks on behalf of AudioCodes. Our IT department, led by our CIO, is responsible for assessing potential vulnerabilities\nand exposures to cybersecurity threats, implementing controls and measures designed to mitigate these risks, and regularly monitoring\nand updating these measures as appropriate to adapt to evolving cybersecurity threats. Our current CIO possesses approximately 10\nyears of experience with information technology and cybersecurity risk management.\nAs part of our board of directors enterprise risk management process, our board of directors has responsibility for oversight of\ncybersecurity risk management. Our board of directors has delegated to the audit committee of our board of directors oversight of our\ncybersecurity risk management program, which, pursuant to the audit committee charter, includes reviewing our cybersecurity and other\ninformation technology risks, controls and procedures, including our plans to mitigate cybersecurity risks and to respond to data\nbreaches. Our internal auditor provides periodic reports to the audit committee covering cybersecurity and other information technology\nrisks affecting us. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we have implemented a process in which our CIO would report such incident\nto our board of directors if the incident is determined to present critical risk to us.\nAudioCodes’ senior management has the ultimate responsibility for the implementation of its risk management policy and risk\nmanagement process on a day-to-day basis. Senior management is accountable for ensuring that the risk management policy is\nestablished, implemented, maintained and reviewed in accordance with the ISO 27001 standard and the organizational objectives. Senior\nmanagement is also responsible for providing the necessary resources, support and guidance for the effective execution of the risk\nmanagement process. In particular, AudioCodes’ senior management demonstrates leadership and commitment to the risk management\npolicy and the risk management process by:\n• Establishing and communicating the risk appetite and the risk criteria for the organization;\n• Approving the risk management policy and ensuring its alignment with the information security policy and the\nInformation Security Management System, or ISMS, manual;\n• Ensuring that the roles and responsibilities for the risk management process are clearly defined and assigned; and\n• Ensuring that the risk management process is integrated into the organizational processes and the ISMS manual.\n- 106 -\n• Ensuring that the risk management process is monitored and reviewed regularly and that the results are reported and\nacted upon.\n• Ensuring that the risk management process is subject to internal and external audits and that the audit findings are\naddressed and resolved.\n• Security and privacy committee meets quarterly and discusses on open issues regarding cyber security and cyber risks.\nPART III\nITEM 17.

(the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022 the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated\nfinancial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position\nof the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)\nand our report dated March 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error\nor fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles\nused and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material\nto the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nF-2\n-3-6232525\n-3-5622555\nKost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer Tel: +972-3-6232525\n144 Menachem Begin Road, Building A Fax: +972-3-5622555\nTel-Aviv 6492102, Israel ey.com\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company generates revenues mainly from sales of products\nand services. The Company's contracts with customers often\ncontain multiple goods and services that are accounted for\nseparately if they are distinct performance obligations. In such\ncontracts, the transaction price is then allocated to the distinct\nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price\nbasis and revenue is recognized when control of the distinct\nperformance obligation is transferred.\nAuditing the Company’s revenue recognition involved a high\ndegree of auditor judgment due to the effort to evaluate (a) the\nidentification and determination of whether products and services\nare considered distinct performance obligations that should be\naccounted for separately such as software licenses and related\nservices, and (b) the determination of standalone selling prices\nfor each distinct performance obligation that is not sold\nseparately.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested\nthe operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the\nidentification of distinct performance obligations, and the\ndetermination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct\nperformance obligation.\nOur audit procedures also included, among others, selecting a\nsample of contracts with customers and reading contract source\ndocuments for each selection, including the executed contracts\nand purchase orders. We tested management’s identification of\nsignificant terms for completeness, including the identification\nand determination of distinct performance obligations. We also\nevaluated the methodology and reasonableness of management’s\nassumptions used for the estimate of stand-alone selling prices on\na sample basis for products and services that are not sold\nseparately. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the related\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\nKost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer,\na Member of EY Global\nTel-Aviv, Israel\nMarch 27, 2024\nF-3\n-3-6232525\n-3-5622555\nKost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer Tel: +972-3-6232525\n144 Menachem Begin Road, Building A Fax: +972-3-5622555\nTel-Aviv 6492102, Israel ey.com\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited AudioCodes Ltd. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AudioCodes Ltd. (collectively, the \"Company\") maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of\noperations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated March 27, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and\nperforming such other procedures, as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention\nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nKost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer,\na Member of EY Global\nTel-Aviv, Israel\nMarch 27, 2024\nF-4\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nU .S.

except share and per share data\nNOTE 1:- GENERAL\na. Business overview:\nAudioCodes Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together with the Company, the “Group”) is a leading\nvendor of advanced communication, software, products and productivity solutions for the digital workplace. The\nCompany’s products are deployed on-premises or delivered from the cloud. Providing software communications,\ncloud-based platforms, customer premise equipment and software applications, the Company’s solutions and\nproducts are geared to meet the growing needs of enterprises and service providers realigning their operations\ntowards the transition to all-IP networks for unified communications, contact centers, and hosted business\nservices. In addition, the Company offers a complete suite of professional and managed services that allow the\nCompany’s partners and customers to choose a service package (or complement their own offering) from a\nmodular portfolio of professional services.\nThe Company operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States, Europe, Asia, Latin America,\nAustralia and Israel.\nb. Material customers and suppliers:\nThe Group is dependent upon sole source suppliers for certain key components used in its products, including\ncertain digital signal processing chips. Although there are a limited number of manufacturers for these particular\ncomponents, management believes that other suppliers could provide similar components on comparable terms\nto the extent needed. Any change in suppliers, however, could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible loss\nof sales, which could materially and adversely affect the operating results and financial position of the Group.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Group had a major customer which accounted\nfor 16.3%, 15.1% and 15.4%, respectively, of total revenues in those years. In addition, during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Group had an additional major customer which accounted for 10.3%,\n10.0% and 10.9%, respectively, of total revenues the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. No other\ncustomer accounted for more than 10% of the Group's revenues in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021.\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), applied on a consistent basis as follows:\na. Use of estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates,\njudgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The\nCompany’s management believes that the estimates, judgments and assumptions used are reasonable based upon\ninformation available at the time they were made. As applicable to these consolidated financial statements, the\nmost significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition and allowance for sales returns,\nallowance for credit losses, inventories write-off, intangible assets, goodwill, income taxes and valuation\nallowance, share-based compensation and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nF-12\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nb. Financial statements in U.S. dollars (“dollars”):\nA majority of the Group’s revenues is generated in dollars. In addition, most of the Group’s costs are denominated\nand determined in dollars and in new Israeli shekels (“NIS”). Management believes that the dollar is the currency\nin the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. Thus, the functional and the reporting\ncurrency of the Group is the dollar.\nAccordingly, monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the dollar are remeasured into dollars in\naccordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 830, “Foreign Currency Matters”. All transaction\ngains and losses of the remeasured monetary balance sheet items are reflected in the consolidated statements of\noperations as financial income or expenses, as appropriate.\nc. Principles of consolidation:\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nIntercompany transactions and balances, including profits from intercompany sales not yet realized outside the\nGroup, have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nd. Cash equivalents:\nCash equivalents represent short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash with original\nmaturities of three months or less at the date acquired.\ne. Short-term and restricted bank deposits:\nShort-term and restricted bank deposits are deposits with maturities of more than three months, but less than one\nyear. The deposits are mainly in dollars and bear interest at an average annual rate of 2.72% and 1.06% for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Short-term and restricted deposits are presented at cost.\nAny accrued interest on these deposits is included in other receivables and prepaid expenses.\nD ecember 31, D ecember 31, D ecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCash and cash equivalents $ 30,546 $ 24,535 $ 79,423\nRestricted cash — — 5,100\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement\nof cash flows $ 30,546 $ 24,535 $ 84,523\nf. Trade receivables:\nThe Group records trade receivables for amounts invoiced and yet unbilled invoices. The Group’s allowance for\ncredit losses for trade receivables is based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience,\nthe age of the trade receivable balances, credit quality of its customers, current economic conditions and other\nfactors. The estimated allowance for credit losses is recorded as general and administrative expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nF-13\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\ng. Marketable securities:\nThe Group accounts for investments in debt securities in accordance with ASC 320, “Investments - Debt\nSecurities”.\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable debt securities at the time\nof purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group classified all of its marketable securities as available-for-sale (“AFS”). AFS\nsecurities are carried out at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in “accumulated\nother comprehensive loss” in shareholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on sale of investments are included\nin “financial income (expenses), net” and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the\ncost of securities. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of\ndiscounts to maturity. Such amortization, together with interest on securities, is included in “financial income\n(expenses), net”.\nThe Group periodically evaluates its AFS debt securities for impairment in accordance with Accounting Standards\nUpdate (“ASU”) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments”. If the amortized cost of an individual security exceeds its fair value, the Group considers\nits intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before\nrecovery of its amortized basis. If either of these criteria are met, the Group writes down the security to its fair\nvalue and records the impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria\nare met, the Group assesses whether credit loss exists. In making this assessment, the Group considers the extent\nto which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and\nany adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a\ncredit loss may exist, the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared\nto the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less\nthan the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded, limited by\nthe amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any additional impairment not recorded\nthrough an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income or loss.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Group’s credit losses were immaterial.\nh. Long-term and restricted bank deposits:\nBank deposits and the related accrued interest with maturities of more than one year are included in long-term\ninvestments and presented at their cost. Accrued interest that is payable within a one-year period is included in\nother receivables and prepaid expenses.\ni. Inventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined as follows:\nRaw materials - using the “weighted average cost” method; and\nFinished products - using the “weighted average cost” method with the addition of direct manufacturing costs.\nF-14\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nThe Group periodically evaluates the quantities on hand relative to current and historical selling prices, historical\nand projected sales volume and technological obsolescence. Based on these evaluations, inventory write-offs are\ntaken based on slow moving items, technological obsolescence, excess inventories, discontinuation of product\nlines, and market prices lower than cost.\nj. Property and equipment:\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated by the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets at the following annual rates:\nComputers and peripheral equipment 33%\nOffice furniture and equipment 6% to 20% (mainly 15%)\nLeasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the\nassets\nThe Group’s long-lived assets (asset group) to be held and used, including right of use assets and intangible that\nare subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant and\nEquipment” whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset\ngroup) may not be recoverable. If such assets are considered to be impaired, recoverability of assets (asset group)\nto be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) to the future\nundiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. The impairment to be recognized is measured by\nthe amount by which the carrying amount of the assets (asset groups) exceeds the fair value of the assets (asset\ngroups).\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, no impairment losses have been identified.\nk. Intangible assets:\nIntangible assets are comprised of acquired technology, customer relations and licenses. Intangible assets that are\nnot considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized using the straight-line basis over their estimated\nuseful lives, which range from 4 to 10 years.\nl. Leases:\nThe Group evaluates the contracts it enters into to determine whether such contracts contain leases. A contract\ncontains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for\na period of time in exchange for consideration.\nThe Group determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the\nterms of the contract are agreed to, and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. The\ncommencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for the lessee's\nuse. At commencement, contracts containing a lease are further evaluated for classification as an operating or\nfinance lease where the Company is a lessee, or as an operating, sales-type or direct financing lease where the\nCompany is a lessor, based on their terms.\nF-15\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nAs the Group's lease arrangements as a lessee do not provide an implicit rate, the Group uses its incremental\nestimated borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities.\nOperating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with a term\nof one year or less, the Group elected not to record the ROU asset or liability. The Group elected to not recognize\na lease liability or ROU asset for leases with a term of twelve months or less. The Group also elected the practical\nexpedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for its leases.\nA portion of the Group's sales of equipment to customers are made through bundled lease arrangements which\ntypically include software license, equipment and services. Revenues under these bundled lease arrangements are\nallocated considering the relative standalone selling prices of the lease and non-lease components included in the\nbundled arrangement. The two primary accounting provisions the Group use to classify transactions as sales-type\nor operating leases are: (i) a review of the lease term to determine if it is for the major part of the economic life\nof the underlying equipment; and (ii) a review of the present value of the lease payments to determine if they are\nequal to or greater than substantially all of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the lease.\nEquipment included in arrangements meeting these conditions are accounted for as sales-type leases and revenue\nis recognized at lease commencement. Equipment included in arrangements that do not meet these conditions are\naccounted for as operating leases and revenue is recognized over the term of the lease. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, equipment leases that were classified as operating leases were immaterial.\nm. Goodwill:\nGoodwill and certain other purchased intangible assets have been recorded in the Group's financial statements as\na result of acquisitions.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of a business\nacquired in a business combination. Under ASC 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\", goodwill is not\namortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test at least annually.\nThe Group performs an annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more\nfrequently. if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is\ntested for impairment at the reporting unit level, by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the reporting\nunit does not pass the qualitative assessment, the Group carries out a quantitative test for impairment of goodwill,\nby comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit that includes\ngoodwill. The Group may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative\ngoodwill impairment test. The Group operates as one reporting segment, and this segment comprises its only\nreporting unit. Therefore, goodwill is tested for impairment at that level. The Group did not record goodwill\nimpairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nn. Revenue recognition:\nThe Group generates its revenues primarily from the sale of software licenses, equipment, and related services\nthrough a direct sales force and sales representatives. The Group's products are delivered to its customers, which\ninclude original equipment manufacturers, network equipment providers, systems integrators, enterprises, carriers\nand distributors in the telecommunications and networking industries, all of whom are considered end-users.\nF-16\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nRevenues are recognized in accordance with ASC 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. As such, the\nGroup identifies a contract with a customer, identifies the performance obligations in the contract, determines the\ntransaction price, allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract and recognizes\nrevenues when (or as) the Group satisfies its performance obligations.\nThe Group enters into contracts that can include combinations of products and services that are capable of being\ndistinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The software licenses and equipment are distinct\nas the customer can derive the economic benefit of it without any additional services. The Group allocates the\ntransaction price to each performance obligation, based on its relative standalone selling price out of the total\nconsideration of the contract.\nSoftware license and equipment revenues are recognized at the point of time when control is transferred,\nRevenues from maintenance and support services are recognized over time ratably over the term of the contract.\nAs the Group generally does not sell the products separately on a standalone basis, the standalone selling prices\nare not directly observable. Therefore, the Group makes estimates, based on reasonably available information.\nThe estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors such as historical selling prices, internal\npricing practices, gross margin objectives and discount policy. The Group typically bills customers based on\nactual delivery. The payment terms vary, mainly with terms of 60 days or less.\nThe Group grants to certain customers a right of return or the ability over a limited period of time to exchange for\nother products a specific percentage of the total price paid for products they have purchased. The Group maintains\na provision for product returns and exchanges and other incentives, based on its experience with historical sales\nreturns, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors, all in accordance with ASC 606. This provision is\ndeducted from revenues and amounted to $2,137 and $2,704 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThis provision was recorded as part of other payables and accrued expenses.\nIn instances of contracts where revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Group generally\ndetermined that those contracts do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of the\ninvoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing the Group’s products\nand services, not to receive or provide financing. The Group uses the practical expedient and does not assess the\nexistence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and revenue recognition is\na year or less.\nDeferred revenues include amounts invoiced to customers for which revenue has not yet been recognized.\nDeferred revenues are recognized as (or when) the Group performs the performance obligations under the\ncontract.\nThe Group pays sales commissions to sales and marketing personnel, based on their attainment of certain\npredetermined sales goals. Amortization expenses related to these costs are included in selling and marketing\nexpenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Group has included as part of other receivables and prepaid expenses in its consolidated balance sheet, costs\nto obtain a contract in the amount of $542 and $829, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nF-17\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nRemaining performance obligations represents contracted revenues that have not yet been recognized, which\nincludes deferred revenues and non-cancelable contracts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods.

Warranty costs:\nThe Group usually provides an assurance-type warranty for a period of 12 months at no extra charge. The Group\nestimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty and records a liability in the amount of\nsuch costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Group’s warranty liability include the\nnumber of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. The Group\nperiodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amount as necessary. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the provision for warranty amounted to $149 and $212, respectively.\np. Research and development costs:\nASC 985-20, “Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed”, requires capitalization of certain software\ndevelopment costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility.\nBased on the Group’s product development process, technological feasibility is established upon the completion\nof a working model. The Group does not incur material costs between the completion of a working model and the\npoint at which the product is ready for general release. Therefore, research and development costs are charged to\nthe consolidated statement of operations, as incurred.\nParticipation grants from the Israel Innovation Authority (the “IIA”) for research and development activity are\nrecognized at the time the Group is entitled to such grants based on the costs incurred and included as a deduction\nfrom research and development costs. Research and development grants recognized during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $665, $624 and $570, respectively.\nF-18\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nq. Income taxes:\nThe Group accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes”. ASC 740 prescribes the use\nof the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for carryforward tax losses.\nDeferred taxes are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse. The Group records a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their\nestimated realizable value if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of or the entire amount of the deferred\ntax asset will not be realized.\nIn addition, ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement\nrecognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to\nevaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This is done by determining if the weight\nof available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the\ntax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The\nsecond step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon\nultimate settlement.\nInterest and penalties assessed by taxing authorities on an underpayment of income taxes are included as a\ncomponent of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nr. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”):\nThe Group accounts for comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with ASC 220, “Comprehensive Income”,\nwhich establishes standards for the reporting and presentation of comprehensive income (loss) and its components\nin a full set of general purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income (loss) generally represents all changes\nin shareholders’ equity during the period except those resulting from investments by, or distributions to,\nshareholders.\nThe components of AOCI were as follows:\nG ains (losses)\non AFS Gains (losses)\nmarketable on cash flow\nsecurities hedges Total\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 $ (6,376) $ (4,577) $ (10,953)\nOther comprehensive loss before reclassifications, net of tax 2,859 (2,165) 481\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI (213) 6,567 6,567\nOther comprehensive income, net of tax 2,646 4,402 7,048\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ (3,730) $ (175) $ (3,905)\nF-19\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nYe ar E n ded Decemb er 3 1 ,\n2023 2022 2021\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI\nCost of revenues $ 1,400 $ 814 $ (513)\nResearch and development expenses, net 2,983 1,735 (990)\nSelling and marketing expenses 1,217 708 (406)\nGeneral and administrative expenses 967 426 (229)\nTotal operating expenses (income), before income taxes $ 6,567 $ 3,683 $ (2,138)\nThe effects on net income of amounts reclassified from AOCI in the year ended December 31, 2023 derive from\nrealized losses on cash flow hedges recorded in operating expenses and from realized losses on AFS marketable\nsecurities recorded in financial income (expenses), net.\ns. Concentrations of credit risk:\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash\nand cash equivalents, bank deposits, trade receivables, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative\ncontracts.\nThe majority of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and foreign currency derivative contracts\nare invested in dollar denominated instruments with major banks in Israel and in the United States. The Group is\nexposed to credit risk in the event of default by financial institutions to the extent of the amounts recorded on the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that the\nfinancial institutions that hold the Group’s investments are corporations with high credit standing.\nAccordingly, management believes that low credit risk exists with respect to these financial investments.\nMarketable securities include investments in dollar-denominated corporate bonds. The Company’s investment\npolicy, approved by the Board of Directors, limits the amount the Group may invest in any one type of investment\nor issuer, thereby reducing credit risk concentrations. Management believes that the Group’s portfolio is well\ndiversified and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these marketable debt securities.\nThe trade receivables of the Group are derived from sales to customers located primarily in the Americas, Europe,\nEastern Asia and Israel. Under certain circumstances, the Group may require letters of credit, other collateral,\nadditional guarantees or advance payments.\nRegarding certain credit balances, the Group is covered by foreign trade risk insurance. The Group performs\nongoing credit evaluations of its customers and establishes an allowance for credit losses.\nt. Earnings per share:\nBasic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding\nduring each year. Diluted earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary\nshares outstanding during each year, plus potential dilutive ordinary shares considered outstanding during the\nyear, in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share”.\nF-20\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nCertain outstanding options and restricted share units (“RSUs”) have been excluded from the calculation of the\ndiluted earnings per share since such securities are anti-dilutive for all years presented. The total weighted average\nnumber of shares related to the outstanding options and RSUs that have been excluded from the calculation of\ndiluted earnings per share was 710,761, 153,191 and 26,686 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\nu. Accounting for share-based compensation:\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation-Stock\nCompensation”. ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the\ndate of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to\nvest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company’s consolidated statement of\noperations.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expenses for the value of its awards, which have graded vesting, based\non the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each of the awards. The Company\naccounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during the years ended December\n31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $3.98, $8.99, and $10.64 per share, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option\npricing model. Fair values were estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions (annualized\npercentages):\nYear E nded Decemb er 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nDividend yield 1.13% 1.13% 0.88%\nExpected volatility 46.24% 47.64% 49.45%\nRisk-free interest 4.57% 2.83% 0.5%\nExpected life 3.60 years 4.10 years 3.61 years\nThe Company used its historical volatility in accordance with ASC 718. The computation of volatility uses\nhistorical volatility derived from the Company’s exchange traded shares. The expected term of options granted is\nestimated based on historical experience and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be\noutstanding. The risk free interest rate assumption is the implied yield currently available on United States\ntreasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the Company’s options. The\ndividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s historical experience and expectation of future dividend\npayouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future. The Company paid its first cash dividend during\nthe third quarter of 2018 and has been paying cash dividends on a bi-annual basis since then. The Company\ncurrently expects to continue pay cash dividends in the future, subject to the Board of Director’s approval and\nreceipt of required Israeli court approvals, although there can be no assurance that it will do so.

Treasury stock:\nThe Company repurchases its ordinary shares from time to time in the open market and holds such repurchased\nshares as treasury stock. The Company presents the cost to repurchase treasury stock as a reduction of\nshareholders’ equity. See also Note 11a.\nw. Severance pay:\nThe liability for severance pay for Israeli employees is calculated pursuant to the Israeli Severance Pay Law, 1963\n(the “Severance Pay Law”), based on the most recent salary of the employees multiplied by the number of years\nof employment as of the balance sheet date for all employees in Israel. Employees who have been employed for\nmore than a one-year period are entitled to one month’s salary for each year of employment or a portion thereof.\nThe Group’s liability for all of its Israeli employees is fully provided for by monthly deposits with severance pay\nfunds, pension funds, insurance policies and by an accrual. The value of these deposits is recorded as an asset in\nthe Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\nThe deposited funds include profits accumulated up to the consolidated balance sheets date. The deposited funds\nmay be withdrawn only upon the fulfillment of the obligation pursuant to the Severance Pay Law or labor\nagreements.\nSince March 2011, the Group’s agreements with new Israeli employees are under Section 14 of the Severance\nPay Law. The Group’s contributions for severance pay have replaced its severance pay obligation. Upon\ncontribution of the full amount of the employee’s monthly salary for each year of service, no additional\ncalculations are conducted between the parties regarding the matter of severance pay and no additional payments\nare made by the Group to the employee upon termination. The Group is legally released from the obligations to\nemployees once the deposit amounts have been paid, and therefore the severance pay liability is not reflected in\nthe balance sheet.\nSeverance pay expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, amounted to $2,995, $3,907 and\n$2,373, respectively.\nF-22\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nx. Employee benefit plan:\nThe Group has 401(k) defined contribution plans covering employees in the United States. All eligible employees\nmay elect to contribute a portion of their annual compensation to the plan through salary deferrals, subject to the\nInternal Revenue Service limit of $20.5 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, plus a catch-up\ncontribution of $7.5 for participants aged 50 or over. The Group matches 50% of employees’ contributions, up to\na maximum of 6% of the employees’ annual pay. In the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the\nGroup matched contributions in the amount of $524, $531 and $431, respectively.\ny. Advertising expenses:\nAdvertising expenses are charged to the consolidated statements of operations as incurred. Advertising expenses\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $1,942, $1,733 and $582, respectively.\nz. Fair value of financial instruments:\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement\nthat should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a\nliability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”\nestablishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in\nmeasuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar\nassets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that\nare not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to\nthe fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. See also Note 7.\nThe estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by the Group using available market\ninformation and valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in estimating fair values.\nAccordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the amounts the Group could realize in a current market\nexchange.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by the Group in estimating its fair value disclosures for\nfinancial instruments:\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, other\nreceivables and other payables and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity\nof such instruments.\nF-23\nAUDIOCODES LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share data\nNOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nThe Group measures its investments in marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair\nvalue. Marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 as the\nvaluation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nThe fair value of financial investments consists of investments in limited partnerships, that are valued at the net\nasset value (“NAV”) which is a practical expedient to their estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund\nadministrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned less its liabilities.\naa. Derivative instruments and hedging:\nThe Group accounts for derivative instruments and hedging based on ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”.\nThe Group accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.\nDerivative instruments that are not designated and qualified as hedging instruments must be adjusted to fair value\nthrough earnings. The changes in the fair value of such instruments are included as gain or loss in “financial\nincome (expenses), net” at each reporting period.\nFor derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated\nas cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged\ntransaction affects earnings and is classified as payroll and rent expenses.\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to\nexpected future cash flows on hedged transactions.\nab. Recently issued accounting pronouncement not yet adopted:\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment\nReporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which requires public entities to\ndisclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim\nand annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements\nin ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an\ninterim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

The CARES Act contains temporary taxpayer favorable\nprovisions related to the use of net operating losses and the deductibility of interest expense, charitable\ncontributions, and qualified improvement property. The Company does not expect to be materially impacted by\nthe CARES Act.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (the“CAA”) was enacted in further response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, in combination with omnibus spending for the 2021 federal fiscal year. The CAA extended\nmany of the provisions enacted by the CARES Act, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. On March 11, 2021, the American\nRescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARPA”) was enacted in still further response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nCompany does not expect the provisions of the ARPA to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nc. Net operating loss carryforward and deferred taxes in respect thereto and in respect of other temporary differences:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has realized all of its carryforward tax losses in Israel, which can be\noffset against taxable income. As of December 31, 2023 the Company recorded a net deferred tax asset of $4,820\nin respect of other temporary differences.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s Israeli subsidiaries have total available carryforward tax losses of\napproximately $71,883. The net operating losses may be offset against taxable income in the future for an\nindefinite period. The Group does not expect utilization of such carryforward tax losses and therefore recorded\nfull valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in respect of such carryforward tax losses.\nThe Company’s U.S. subsidiary has total available carryforward tax losses of approximately $22,020 to offset\nagainst future U.S. federal taxable gains. These carryforward tax losses expire between 2024 and 2032. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company’s U.S. subsidiary recorded a deferred tax asset of $1,345 in respect of such\ncarryforward tax losses.\nUtilization of U.S. net operating losses may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the “change in\nownership” provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation\nmay result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.\nd.

The Company’s ordinary shares\nare listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “AUDC”.\nDESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL\nThis description summarizes relevant provisions of the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999, or the Companies Law. The following\nsummary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the applicable provisions of\nthe Companies Law and the Company’s articles of association, a copy of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual\nReport on Form 20-F of which this Exhibit 2.1 is a part. The Company encourages you to read its articles of association and the applicable\nprovisions of the Companies Law for additional information.\nAuthorized Share Capital\nOur authorized share capital consists of NIS 1,025,000 divided into 100,000,000 ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 0.01 per\nshare, and 2,500,000 preferred shares, nominal value NIS 0.01 per share. As of March 20, 2024, we had 30,324,284 ordinary shares\noutstanding (which does not include 34,406,682 treasury shares) and no preferred shares outstanding.\nBorrowing Powers\nThe board of directors has the power to cause us to borrow money and to secure the payment of borrowed money. The board of\ndirectors specifically has the power to issue bonds or debentures, and to impose mortgages or other security interests on all or any part\nof our property.\nAmendment of Articles of Association\nIn general, shareholders may amend our articles of association by a resolution adopted at a shareholders meeting by the holders\nof 50% of the voting power represented at the meeting in person or by proxy and voting thereon. The amendment of certain provisions\nof our articles of association requires an increased voting threshold. For example, the approval of amendments to the provisions\nconcerning business combinations with certain shareholders requires the approval of holders of 85% of our outstanding voting shares.\nAdditionally, amendments to the provisions concerning (i) the procedure according to which shareholders may propose items to include\nin the agenda of a general meeting of the shareholders and (ii) the role and composition of the board of directors, including the method\nof appointment of its members, require the approval sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power represented at the\nmeeting in person or by proxy and voting thereon.\nQualification of Directors\nNo person shall be disqualified to serve as a director by reason of his or her not holding shares of the Company or by reason of\nhis or her having served as a director in the past.\nDividends\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may make “distributions”, as such term is defined in the Companies Law (which definition\nincludes the payment of dividends and a company’s repurchase of its outstanding shares) only out of its profits as determined for\nstatutory purposes, unless court approval is granted for such despite the lack of statutory profits. There is a unified statutory test for the\npayment of dividends and a company’s repurchase of its outstanding shares. In 2023, we received court approval to pay dividends (and\nrepurchase our shares) up to certain ceilings, despite the lack of statutory profits. The current approval is valid until June 18, 2024. We\nmay seek further approvals to repurchase our shares and to continue to pay dividends. As we are a Nasdaq-listed company, court approval\nis not required for our repurchase of our shares, provided that we notify our creditors of the proposed repurchase and allow such creditors\nan opportunity to initiate a court proceeding to review the repurchase. If within 30 days such creditors do not file an objection, then we\nmay proceed with the repurchase. In each case, we are only permitted to make the distribution if our board of directors and, if applicable,\nthe court, determines there is no reasonable concern that such distribution will prevent us from satisfying our existing and foreseeable\nobligations as they become due. The amount of any dividend to be distributed among shareholders is based on the nominal value of their\nshares.\nVoting Rights and Powers\nUnless any shares have special rights as to voting, every shareholder has one vote for each share held of record.\nUnder our articles of association, we may issue preferred shares from time to time, in one or more series. However, in connection\nwith our listing on The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange in 2001, we agreed that for such time as our ordinary shares are traded on The Tel-\nAviv Stock Exchange, we will not issue any of the 2,500,000 preferred shares, nominal value NIS 0.01, authorized in our articles of\nassociation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may issue preferred shares if the preference of those shares is limited to a preference in\nthe distribution of dividends and such preferred shares have no voting rights.\nBusiness Combinations\nOur articles of association impose restrictions on our ability to engage in any merger, asset or share sale or other similar\ntransaction with a shareholder holding 15% or more of our voting shares.\nWinding Up\nUpon our liquidation, our assets available for distribution to shareholders will be distributed to them in proportion to the nominal\nvalue of their shares.\nRedeemable Shares\nSubject to our undertaking to the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange as described above, we may issue and redeem redeemable shares.\nModification of Rights\nSubject to the provisions of our articles of association, we may, from time to time, by a resolution approved by the holders of a\nsimple majority of the voting power represented at the meeting in person or by proxy and voting thereon, provide for shares with such\npreference rights,\ndeferred rights or conversion rights, or any other special rights or limitations as may be stipulated in such resolution.\nIf at any time our share capital is divided into different classes of shares, we may modify or abrogate the rights attached to any\nclass, unless otherwise provided by the articles of association, by a resolution approved by the holders of a simple majority of the voting\npower represented at the meeting in person or by proxy and voting thereon, subject to the consent in writing of the holders of a simple\nmajority of the issued shares of that class (unless otherwise provided by law or by the terms of issue of the shares of that class).\nThe provisions of our articles of association relating to general meetings also apply, mutatis mutandis, to any separate general\nmeeting of the holders of the shares of a particular class.\nThe creation or issuance of shares of any class, including a new class, shall not be deemed to alter the rights and privileges\nattached to previously issued shares of that class or of any other class (unless otherwise provided by our articles of association, including\nthe terms of issue of the shares of any class).\nShareholder Meetings\nAn annual meeting of shareholders is to be held once a year, within 15 months after the previous annual meeting. The annual\nmeeting may be held in Israel or outside of Israel, as determined by the board of directors.\nThe board of directors may, whenever it thinks fit, convene a special shareholders meeting. The board of directors must convene\na special shareholders meeting at the request of:\n● at least two directors;\n● at least one-quarter of the directors in office; or\n● one or more shareholders who hold at least 5% of the outstanding share capital and at least 1% of the voting rights, or\none or more shareholders who hold at least 5% of the outstanding voting rights.\nA special shareholders meeting may be held in Israel or outside of Israel, as determined by the board of directors.\nNotice of General Meetings; Omission to Give Notice\nThe provisions of the Companies Law and the related regulations override the provisions of our articles of association, and\nprovide for notice of a meeting of shareholders to be sent to each registered shareholder at least 21 days or 35 days in advance of the\nmeeting, depending on the items included in the meeting agenda. Notice of a meeting of shareholders must also be published in two\nIsraeli newspapers or on our website.\nNotice of a meeting of shareholders must specify the type of meeting, the place and time of the meeting, the agenda, a summary\nof the proposed resolutions, the majority required to adopt the proposed resolutions, and the record date for the meeting. The notice\nmust also include the\naddress and telephone number of our registered office, and a list of times at which the full text of the proposed resolutions may be\nexamined at the registered office.\nThe accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to any shareholder, or the non-receipt of notice sent to such shareholder, does\nnot invalidate the proceedings at the meeting.\nLimitations on Foreign Shareholders to Hold or Exercise Voting Rights\nThere are no limitations on foreign shareholders in our articles of association. Israeli law restricts the ability of citizens of\ncountries that are in a state of war with Israel to hold shares of Israeli companies.\nFiduciary Duties; Approval of Transactions under Israeli Law\nFiduciary duties. The Companies Law codifies the fiduciary duties that office holders, which under the Companies Law includes\nour directors and executive officers, owe to a company. An office holder’s fiduciary duties consist of a duty of loyalty and a duty of\ncare.\nThe duty of loyalty requires an office holder to act in good faith and for the benefit of the company, including to avoid any\nconflict of interest between the office holder’s position in the company and personal affairs, and prohibits any competition with the\ncompany or the exploitation of any business opportunity of the company in order to receive a personal advantage for himself or herself\nor for others. This duty also requires an office holder to reveal to the company any information or documents relating to the company’s\naffairs that the office holder has received due to his or her position as an office holder. A company may approve any of the acts mentioned\nabove provided that all the following conditions apply: the office holder acted in good faith and neither the act nor the approval of the\nact prejudices the good of the company and, the office holder disclosed the essence of his personal interest in the act, including any\nsubstantial fact or document, a reasonable time before the date for discussion of the approval. A director is required to exercise\nindependent discretion in fulfilling his or her duties and may not be party to a voting agreement with respect to his or her vote as a\ndirector. A violation of these requirements is deemed a breach of the director’s duty of loyalty.\nThe duty of care requires an office holder to act with a level of care that a reasonable office holder in the same position would\nemploy under the same circumstances. This includes the duty to use reasonable means to obtain information regarding the advisability\nof a given action submitted for his or her approval or performed by virtue of his or her position and all other relevant information material\nto these actions.\nDisclosure of personal interest. The Companies Law requires that an office holder promptly disclose to the company any\npersonal interest that he or she may have and all related material information or documents known to him or her, in connection with any\nexisting or proposed transaction by the company. “Personal interest,” as defined by the Companies Law, includes a personal interest of\nany person in an act or transaction of the company, including a personal interest of his relative or of a corporation in which that person\nor a relative of that person is a 5% or greater shareholder, a holder of 5% or more of the voting rights, a director or general manager, or\nin which he or she has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager, and includes shares for which the person has the\nright to vote pursuant to a power-of-attorney.\n“Personal interest” does not apply to a personal interest stemming merely from holding shares in the company.\nThe office holder must make the disclosure of his personal interest no later than the first meeting of the company’s board of\ndirectors that discusses the particular transaction. This duty does not apply to the personal interest of a relative of the office holder in a\ntransaction unless it is an “extraordinary transaction.” The Companies Law defines an “extraordinary transaction” as a transaction that\nis not in the ordinary course of business, not on market terms or that is likely to have a material impact on the company’s profitability,\nassets or liabilities.\nApprovals. The Companies Law provides that a transaction with an office holder or a transaction in which an office holder has a\npersonal interest requires board approval, unless the transaction is an extraordinary transaction or the articles of association provide\notherwise. Our articles of association do not provide otherwise. The transaction may be approved only if it is in our best interest. If the\ntransaction is an extraordinary transaction, then the approvals of the company’s audit committee and the board of directors are required.\nIf the transaction concerns exculpation, indemnification, insurance or compensation of an office holder, then the approvals of the\ncompany’s compensation committee and the board of directors are required, except if the compensation arrangement is an immaterial\namendment to an existing compensation arrangement of an officer who is not a director, in which case the approval of the compensation\ncommittee is sufficient. Exculpation, indemnification, insurance or compensation of a director or the Chief Executive Officer also\nrequires shareholder approval.\nA person who has a personal interest in a matter that is considered at a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee\ngenerally may not attend that meeting or vote on that matter, unless a majority of the board of directors or the audit committee has a\npersonal interest in the matter or if such person is invited by the chairman of the board of directors or audit committee, as applicable, to\npresent the matter being considered. If a majority of the board of directors or the audit committee has a personal interest in the transaction,\nshareholder approval also would be required.\nShareholders\nThe Companies Law imposes on a controlling shareholder of a public company the same disclosure requirements described above\nas it imposes on an office holder. For this purpose, a “controlling shareholder” is any shareholder who has the ability to direct the\ncompany’s actions, including any shareholder holding 25% or more of the voting rights if no other shareholder owns more than 50% of\nthe voting rights in the company. Two or more shareholders with a personal interest in the approval of the same transaction are deemed\nto be one shareholder.\nApproval of the audit committee, the board of directors and our shareholders, in that order, is required for extraordinary\ntransactions, including a private placement, with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest.\nApproval of the compensation committee, the board of directors and our shareholders, in that order, is required for the terms of\ncompensation or employment of a controlling shareholder or his or her relative, as an officer holder or employee of our company or as\na service provider to the company, including through a company controlled by a controlling shareholder.\nShareholder approval must include the majority of shares voted at the meeting. In addition to the majority vote, the shareholder\napproval must satisfy either of two additional tests:\n● the majority includes at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders who have no personal interest in the\ntransaction; or\n● the total number of shares held by disinterested shareholders that voted against the approval of the transaction does not\nexceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights of our company.\nGenerally, the approval of such a transaction may not extend for more than three years, except that in the case of an extraordinary\ntransaction, including a private placement, with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest\nthat does not concern compensation for employment or service, the transaction may be approved for a longer period if the audit\ncommittee determines that the approval of the transaction for a period longer than three years is reasonable under the circumstances.\nDuties of Shareholders\nUnder the Companies Law, a shareholder also has a duty to act in good faith towards the company and other shareholders and\nrefrain from abusing his or her power in the company, including, among other things, voting in the general meeting of shareholders on\nthe following matters:\n● any amendment to the articles of association;\n● an increase of the company’s authorized share capital;\n● a merger; or\n● approval of related party transactions that require shareholder approval.\nIn addition, any controlling shareholder, any shareholder who can determine the outcome of a shareholder vote and any\nshareholder who, under the company’s articles of association, can appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder, is under a\nduty to act with fairness towards the company. The Companies Law also provides that a breach of the duty of fairness will be governed\nby the laws governing breach of contract; however, the Companies Law does not describe the substance of this duty.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions Under Israeli Law\nThe Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as a\nresult of the acquisition the purchaser would hold 25% or more of the voting rights in the company, unless there is already another\nshareholder of the company with 25% or more of the voting rights. Similarly, the Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares\nin a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would hold more than 45%\nof the voting rights in the company, unless there is a shareholder with more than 45% of the voting rights in the company.\nThe Companies Law requires the parties to a proposed merger to file a merger proposal with the Israeli Registrar of Companies,\nspecifying certain terms of the transaction. Each merging company’s board of directors and shareholders must approve the merger.\nShares in one of the merging companies held by the other merging company or certain of its affiliates are disenfranchised for purposes\nof voting on the merger. A merging company must inform its creditors of the proposed merger. Any creditor of a party to the merger\nmay seek a court order blocking the merger, if there is a reasonable concern that the surviving company will not be able to satisfy all of\nthe obligations of the parties to the merger. Moreover, a merger may not be completed until at least 50 days have passed from the time\nthat the merger proposal was filed with the Israeli Registrar of Companies and at least 30 days have passed from the approval of the\nshareholders of each of the merging companies.\nFinally, in general, Israeli tax law treats stock-for-stock acquisitions less favorably than does U.S. tax law. Israeli tax law provides\nfor tax deferral in specified acquisitions, including transactions where the consideration for the sale of shares is the receipt of shares of\nthe acquiring company. Nevertheless, Israeli tax law may subject a shareholder who exchanges his ordinary shares for shares in a foreign\ncorporation to immediate taxation or to taxation before his investment in the foreign corporation becomes liquid, although in the case\nof shares of a foreign corporation that are traded on a stock exchange, the tax may be postponed subject to certain conditions.\nExhibit 4.21\nEnglish Summary Translation of Building and Tenancy Lease Agreement, dated June 14, 2023, by and between MAY A.B.\nNADLAN LTD (“MAY”), Migdal Group Insurance & Finance Migdal Makefet Pension Funds and Provident Funds Ltd, PEL-\nHAMAGEN HOUSE LTD (sides 2-4: “Migdal”), and AudioCodes Ltd.\n(Summary of a Document Originally in Hebrew)\nBuilding and Tenancy Lease Agreement, dated June 14, 2023 (the “Lease Agreement”), by and between MAY A.B.

Compensation Recovery (“Clawback”)\n10.1 For purposes of this Section 10, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n“Applicable Recovery Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Calculation Date for a Material\nFinancial Accounting Restatement. In addition, in the event AudioCodes has changed its fiscal year: (i) any transition period of\nless than nine months occurring within or immediately following such three completed fiscal years shall also be part of such\nApplicable Recovery Period; and (ii) any transition period of nine to 12 months will be deemed to be a completed fiscal year.\n“Applicable Rules” means, collectively: (i) the Companies Law; (ii) any rules or regulations adopted by NASDAQ pursuant to\nRule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act; (iii) any applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC pursuant to Section 10D\nof the Exchange Act; and (iv) any other applicable rules or standards adopted by the SEC or any national securities exchange\non which AudioCodes’ securities are listed from time to time.\n“Calculation Date” means, with respect to a Material Financial Accounting Restatement, the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the\nBoard of Directors or the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that\nAudioCodes is required to prepare the Material Financial Accounting Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other\nlegally authorized body directs AudioCodes to prepare the Material Financial Accounting Restatement.\n“Covered Person” means any Executive Officer. A person’s status as a Covered Person with respect to Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation shall be determined as of the time of receipt of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation regardless of such\nperson’s current role or status with AudioCodes (e.g., if a person began service as an Executive Officer after the beginning of\nan Applicable Recovery Period, that person would not be considered a Covered Person with respect to Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation received before the person began service as an Executive Officer, but would be considered a Covered Person\nwith respect to Erroneously Awarded Compensation received after the person began service as an Executive Officer where such\nperson served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Erroneously Awarded Compensation).\n“Effective Date” means October 25, 2023.\n“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of any Incentive-Based Compensation received by a Covered Person\non or after the Effective Date and during the Applicable Recovery Period that exceeds the amount that otherwise would have\nbeen received by the Covered Person had such compensation been determined based on the restated amounts in the Material\nFinancial Accounting Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid. Calculation of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation based on share price or total shareholder return, where the amount\nof Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Material\nFinancial Accounting Restatement, shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Material Financial Accounting\nRestatement on the share price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received, and\nAudioCodes shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to\nNASDAQ in accordance with the Applicable Rules. Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received, earned or vested when\nthe Financial Reporting Measure is attained, not when the actual payment, grant or vesting occurs.\n“Exchange Act” means the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n“Financial Reporting Measures” mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles\nused in preparing AudioCodes’s financial statements, any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures\n(including, for example, a non-GAAP financial measure), and share price and total shareholder return.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation provided, directly or indirectly, by AudioCodes or any of its\nsubsidiaries that is granted, earned, or vested based, in whole or in part, upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure\nand any equity-based compensation provided by AudioCodes or any of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, stock\noptions, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights.\n“Material Financial Accounting Restatement” means a restatement of previously issued financial statements of AudioCodes due\nto the material noncompliance of AudioCodes with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any\nrequired restatement to correct an error in previously-issued financial statements that is material to the previously-issued\nfinancial statements or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left\nuncorrected in the current period.\n“NASDAQ” means the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.\n“SEC” means the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n10.2 The Board of Directors believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain a culture\nthat emphasizes integrity and accountability. The Board of Directors has therefore adopted the provisions set forth under this Section\n10, sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which AudioCodes shall recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation from\nCovered Persons in accordance with the Applicable Rules.\n10.3 In the event AudioCodes is required to prepare a Material Financial Accounting Restatement, AudioCodes shall recover reasonably\npromptly from the applicable Executive Officers all Erroneously Awarded Compensation with respect to such Material Financial\nAccounting Restatement; provided, that, AudioCodes may elect not to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this\nPolicy if the Compensation Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable, and one or more of the following conditions,\ntogether with any further requirements set forth in the Applicable Rules, are met: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party, including\noutside legal counsel, to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, and AudioCodes has made a reasonable\nattempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation; (ii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement\nplan to fail to be so qualified under applicable regulations; or (iii) in the event of a Material Financial Accounting Restatement required\ndue to changes in the applicable financial reporting standards (as determined by the Company’s independent auditor).\n10.4 To the extent that, pursuant to this Policy, AudioCodes is entitled to recover any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is\nreceived by a Covered Person, the gross amount received (i.e., the amount the Covered Person received, or was entitled to receive,\nbefore any deductions for tax withholding or other payments) shall be returned by the Covered Person. For purposes of this Policy, when\ncompensation is deemed to be “granted,” “earned” or “vested,” the date on which a restatement shall be deemed to be required, and the\ntype of restatement for which this provision shall apply, shall be as provided in the Applicable Rules.\n10.5 The Compensation Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recovering Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation hereunder, which may include, without limitation, any one or more of the following: (i) requiring reimbursement of cash\nIncentive-Based Compensation previously paid; (ii) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale,\ntransfer or other disposition of any equity-based awards; (iii) cancelling or rescinding some or all outstanding vested or unvested equity-\nbased awards; (iv) adjusting or withholding from unpaid compensation or other set-off; (v) cancelling or offsetting against planned\nfuture grants of equity-based awards; and/or (vi) any other method permitted by applicable law or contract.\n10.6 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Covered Person will be deemed to have satisfied such person’s obligation to return Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation to AudioCodes if such Erroneously Awarded Compensation is returned in the exact same form in which it was\nreceived; provided, that, equity withheld to satisfy tax obligations will be deemed to have been received in cash in an amount equal to\nthe tax withholding payment made.\n10.7 This Policy shall be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Applicable Rules and any other applicable law. The\nCompensation Committee shall take into consideration any applicable interpretations and guidance of the SEC in interpreting this Policy,\nincluding, for example, in determining whether a financial restatement qualifies as a Material Financial Accounting Restatement\nhereunder. Any provision of the Applicable Rules required by the SEC or NASDAQ, as the case may be, shall be deemed to comply\nwith this Policy. To the extent the Applicable Rules require recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation in additional circumstances\nbesides those specified above, nothing in this Policy shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right or obligation of AudioCodes to recover\nIncentive-Based Compensation to the fullest extent required by the Applicable Rules.\n10.8 This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by the Applicable Rules,\ntheir beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition\nto, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to AudioCodes under applicable law, regulation, or\nrule pursuant to the terms of any policy of AudioCodes or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement,\ncompensatory plan, agreement, or other arrangement. AudioCodes shall file this Policy and, in the event of a Material Financial\nAccounting Restatement, will disclose information related to such Material Financial Accounting Restatement in accordance with\napplicable law, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Applicable Rules.\n10.9 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any agreement with, or the organizational documents of, AudioCodes or any\nof its subsidiaries, Covered Persons are not and shall not be entitled to indemnification for Erroneously Awarded Compensation or for\nany claim or losses arising out of or in any way related to Erroneously Awarded Compensation recovered under this Policy.\n10.10 The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee are each authorized to interpret and construe this Section 10 and to\nmake all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of the Applicable Rules. It is intended that this Policy\nbe interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Applicable Rules. Nothing in this Section 10 derogates from\nany other “clawback” or similar provisions regarding disgorging of profits imposed on Executive Officers by virtue of any applicable\nsecurities laws or other laws, regulations or listing standards.\n* * * * * *"
