Use of Estimates and Uncertainties\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe Company uses estimates to determine an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable,\nlitigation, medical claims, vacation, goodwill impairment, if any, equity compensation, the tax rate applied and\nthe valuation of certain assets and liability accounts. In addition, the Company reviews its estimated costs to\ncomplete a contract and adjusts those costs when necessary. These estimates can be significant to the operating\nresults and financial position of the Company. The estimates are based upon various factors including current\nand historical trends, as well as other pertinent industry and regulatory authority information. Management\nregularly evaluates this information to determine if it is necessary to update the basis for its estimates and to\nadjust for known changes.\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care\ninsurance. The amounts included in the Company’s costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can\nvary based on changes in assumptions, the Company’s claims experience or the providers included in the\nassociated insurance programs.\nThe Company can be affected by a variety of factors including uncertainty relating to the performance of the\ngeneral economy, competition, demand for the Company’s services, adverse litigation and claims and the\nhiring, training and retention of key employees.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s carrying value of financial instruments, consisting primarily of accounts receivable, transit\naccounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, transit accounts payable and borrowings under\nline of credit approximates fair value due to their liquidity or their short-term nature and the line of credit’s\nvariable interest rate. The Company does not have derivative products in place to manage risks related to\nforeign currency fluctuations for its foreign operations or for interest rate changes.\nThe Company re-measures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period and any\nchange in the fair value from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, is\nrecorded in earnings in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\n10\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring\nservices promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to\nreceive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate\nservice streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the\ncontract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the\ntransaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize\nrevenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company’s Engineering Services, Life Sciences\nand Information Technology segments perform consulting and project solution services. The Healthcare\nsegment specializes in long-term and short-term staffing and placement services to hospitals, schools and long-\nterm care facilities amongst others. All of the Company’s segments perform staff augmentation services and\nderive revenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company’s revenue is invoiced on a time\nand materials basis.\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue source for the thirteen weeks ended April 1,\n2023 and April 2, 2022:\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nApril 1, April 2,\n2023 2022\nSpecialty Health Care:\nTime and Material $38,834 $52,023\nPermanent Placement Services 296 161\nTotal Specialty Health Care $39,130 $52,184\nEngineering:\nTime and Material $10,470 $10,675\nFixed Fee 8,020 9,223\nTotal Engineering $18,490 $19,898\nLife Sciences and Information Technology:\nTime and Material $8,234 $9,156\nFixed Fee 1,156 546\nPermanent Placement Services 114 177\nTotal Life Sciences and Information Technology $9,504 $9,879\nTotal revenue $67,124 $81,961\n11\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition (Continued)\nTime and Material\nThe Company’s Life Sciences and Information Technology and Health Care segments predominantly recognize\nrevenue through time and material work while its Engineering segment recognizes revenue through both time\nand material and fixed fee work. The Company’s time and material contracts are typically based on the number\nof hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials\ncontracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed Fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of\nits customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements\nare typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that\nfixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company’s fixed fee\npurchase orders are typically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are\nprovided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain\ninstances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue\nunder these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. From time-to-time,\namounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAdditionally, some contracts contain “Performance Fees” (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget.\nPerformance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified\nmaximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined.\nFor contracts where there is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the revenue is not\nrecognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the\nrelated revenue is recognized.\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are\ntypically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company’s client. The\nCompany guarantees its permanent placements on a prorated basis for 90 days. In the event a candidate is not\nretained for the 90-day period, the Company will provide a suitable replacement candidate. In the event a\nreplacement candidate cannot be located, the Company will provide a prorated refund to the client. An\nallowance for refunds, based upon the Company’s historical experience, is recorded in the financial statements.\nDeferred Revenue\nThere was $0.8 million of deferred revenue as of April 1, 2023. Deferred revenue was $1.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be\nrecognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet, although this is\nan infrequent occurrence. For the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, the Company\nrecognized revenue of $0.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the\nbeginning of the reporting period.\n12\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition (Continued)\nConcentration\nDuring the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, the Company had two customers exceed 10% of consolidated\nrevenue, representing 19.4% and 10.5% of consolidated revenue. During the thirteen weeks ended April 2,\n2022, the Company had two customers exceed 10% of consolidated revenue, representing 23.9% and 13.0% of\nconsolidated revenue. In both periods presented, both customers are included in the Company’s Specialty\nHealth Care segment.\n4. Accounts Receivable, Transit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payable\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are comprised of the following:\nApril 1, December 31,\n2023 2022\nBilled $42,325 $40,256\nUnbilled 12,842 6,615\nWork-in-progress 4,743 4,991\nAllowance for sales discounts and doubtful accounts (1,100 ) (1,100 )\nAccounts receivable, net $58,809 $50,762\nUnbilled receivables primarily represent revenue earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the\nbalance sheet ending date. Work-in-progress primarily represents revenue earned under contracts which the\nCompany contractually invoices at future dates.\nFrom time to time, the Company’s Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things,\nconstruction management and engineering services. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may engage\nsubcontractors to provide construction or other services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project\nvalue; and c) assumes no ownership or risks of inventory. In such situations, the Company acts as an agent\nunder the provisions of FASB ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and therefore recognizes\nrevenue on a “net-basis.” The Company records revenue on a “net” basis on relevant engineering and\nconstruction management projects, which require subcontractor/procurement costs or transit costs. In those\nsituations, the Company charges the client a negotiated fee, which is reported as net revenue when earned.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the\ncorresponding payment from the Company’s end-client is received. Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of\nthe subcontractor or staffing agency, the Company records this amount simultaneously as both a “transit\naccount receivable” and “transit account payable,” as the amount when paid to the Company is due to and\ngenerally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The Company typically does not pay a given transit\naccount payable until the related transit account receivable is collected. The Company is typically obligated to\npay the subcontractor or staffing agency whether or not the client pays the Company. The Company’s transit\naccounts payable generally exceeds the Company’s transit accounts receivable but absolute amounts and\nspreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The transit accounts\nreceivable was $4.5 million and related transit accounts payable was $12.5 million, for a net payable of $8.0\nmillion, as of April 1, 2023. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net\npayable of $6.5 million as of December 31, 2022 as compared to a net payable of $1.1 million as of January 1,\n2022.\n13\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and are depreciated\nor amortized on the straight-line method at rates calculated to provide for retirement of assets at the end of their\nestimated useful lives. Computer hardware and software, and furniture and office equipment are typically\ndepreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the\nasset or the lease term.\nProperty and equipment are comprised of the following:\nApril 1, December 31,\n2023 2022\nComputers and systems $4,187 $4,077\nEquipment and furniture 257 220\nLeasehold improvements 407 267\nLaboratory equipment 111 67\n4,962 4,630\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization 2,798 2,532\nProperty and equipment, net $2,164 $2,098\nThe Company periodically writes off fully depreciated and amortized assets. The Company did not write off\nany fully depreciated and amortized assets during the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023. The Company wrote\noff fully depreciated and amortized assets of $49 during the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2022. Depreciation\nand amortization expense of property and equipment for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2,\n2022 was $271 and $238, respectively.\n6. Acquisitions and Divestitures\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of April 1, 2023, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain\nassets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, “TKE”), and 2)\neffective October 2, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates\nfuture contingent payments at April 1, 2023 as follows:\nTotal\nThe four quarters following April 1, 2023 $472\nThereafter 1,970\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $2,442\n14\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n6. Acquisitions and Divestitures (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments (Continued)\nFor acquisitions that involve contingent consideration, the Company records a liability equal to the fair value of\nthe estimated contingent consideration obligation as of the acquisition date. The Company determines the\nacquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on the likelihood of paying the additional\nconsideration. The fair value is estimated using projected future operating results and the corresponding future\nearn-out payments that can be earned upon the achievement of specified operating objectives and financial\nresults by acquired companies using Level 3 inputs and the amounts are then discounted to present value. These\nliabilities are measured quarterly at fair value, and any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration\nliability is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. During the measurement period, which may\nbe up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\nperiod or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of April 1, 2023. Contingent\nconsideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in\nother (expense) income, net.\nPotential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after April 1, 2023 are capped at a\ncumulative maximum of $11.8 million. The Company did not pay contingent consideration during the thirteen\nweeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022.\n7. Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in\nbusiness combinations. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the\nCompany's fiscal year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value\nof goodwill may be below the carrying amount. The Company reviewed industry and market conditions,\nreporting unit specific events as well as overall financial performance and determined that no indicators of\nimpairment of goodwill existed during the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023. As such, no impairment loss on\nthe Company’s intangible assets during the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 was recorded as a result of such\nreview.\nThe carrying amount of goodwill as of April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was as follows:\nSpecialty Information\nEngineering Health Care Technology Total\n$11,918 $2,398 $7,831 $22,147\n15\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n8. Line of Credit\nThe Company’s Revolving Credit Facility was amended and restated as of April 24, 2023. See Note 17,\n“Subsequent Events.” The disclosure set forth in this Note 8 is as of April 1, 2023, prior to such amendment\nand restatement.\nThe Company’s Revolving Credit Facility provides for a $45.0 million revolving credit facility, has no sub-limit\nfor letters of credit, and expires on August 8, 2023.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n(which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable\nmargin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-\nday increments or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company\nalso pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line\nfees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees,\nfor the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 were 6.0% and 1.6%, respectively.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various\nfinancial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order\nto pay dividends. As of April 1, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the\nRevolving Credit Facility (as amended). The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its\nfinancial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $19.2 million and $8.8\nmillion, respectively. There were letters of credit outstanding at April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 for $2.0\nmillion and $1.9 million, respectively. At April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had availability\nfor additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $23.8 million and $34.3 million, respectively.\n9. Per Share Data\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares outstanding used for\ndiluted earnings per share. The number of weighted-average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings\nper share for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 was determined as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nApril 1, April 2,\n2023 2022\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 9,172,511 10,230,510\nDilutive effect of outstanding restricted share awards 229,356 333,485\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 9,401,867 10,563,995\nFor all periods presented, there were no anti-dilutive shares included in the calculation of common stock\nequivalents as there were no stock options outstanding.\n16\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n9. Per Share Data (Continued)\nUnissued shares of common stock were reserved for the following purposes:\nApril 1, December 31,\n2023 2022\nTime-based restricted stock awards outstanding 471,096 274,939\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards outstanding 100,000 -\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards outstanding\nunder plans to be approved by the shareholders - 225,000\nFuture grants of options or shares 632,094 890,682\nShares reserved for employee stock purchase plan 331,160 364,231\nTotal 1,534,350 1,754,852\n10. Share-Based Compensation\nAt April 1, 2023, the Company had two share-based employee compensation plans, the Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan and the 2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.\nThe Company measures the fair value of share-based awards, if and when granted, based on the Black-Scholes\nmethod and using the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Awards\ntypically vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within 10 years of issuance. The Company\nmay also issue immediately vested equity awards. Share-based compensation expense related to time-based\nawards is amortized in accordance with applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. The\nCompany expenses performance-based awards only when the performance metrics are likely to be achieved and\nthe associated awards are therefore likely to vest. Performance-based share awards that are likely to vest are\nalso expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period but may vest on a retroactive basis or be reversed,\ndepending on when it is determined that they are likely to vest, or in the case of a reversal when they are later\ndetermined to be unlikely to vest or forfeited.\nShare-based compensation expense for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 was $496 and\n$403, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative\nexpense in the Company’s statement of operations.\nAs of April 1, 2023, the Company had $3.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, with\napproximately $3.2 million related to time-based non-vested share-based awards outstanding and $0.5 million\nrelated to performance-based non-vested share-based awards outstanding. The Company expects to recognize\nthe expense associated with time-based non-vested share-based awards through fiscal 2027. If earned, the\nCompany will recognize the expense associated with performance-based non-vested share-based awards\nstraight-line through fiscal 2023. These amounts do not include a) the cost of any additional share-based\nawards granted in future periods or b) the impact of any potential changes in the Company’s forfeiture rate.\n17\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n10. Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\nIncentive Share-Based Plans\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company implemented the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) with shareholder\napproval, effective January 1, 2001. Under the Purchase Plan, employees meeting certain specific employment\nqualifications are eligible to participate and can purchase shares of common stock semi-annually through\npayroll deductions at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the commencement or end of the\noffering period. The purchase plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock through\npayroll deductions for up to 10% of qualified compensation, subject to maximum purchases in any one fiscal\nyear of 3,000 shares.\nIn fiscal 2015, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,100,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Purchase Plan to December 31, 2025. In fiscal 2018,\nthe Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares\nof stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000 shares so that the\ntotal number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be 1,400,000 shares. In\nfiscal 2021, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 400,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,800,000 shares and the termination date of the Purchase Plan was extended to December 31, 2030.\nThe Company has two offering periods in the Purchase Plan coinciding with the Company’s first two fiscal\nquarters and the last two fiscal quarters. Actual shares are issued on the first business day of the subsequent\noffering period for the prior offering period payroll deductions. The number of shares issued on January 3,\n2023 (the first business day following the previous offering period) was 33,071. As of April 1, 2023, there were\n331,160 shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Compensation expense, representing the\ndiscount to the quoted market price, for the Purchase Plan for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 was $75,\nand for the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2022 was $60.\n18\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\n2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan)\nThe 2014 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in December 2014, initially provided for the issuance\nof up to 625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to officers, non-employee directors, employees of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries, or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company. In fiscal 2016, fiscal 2020\nand fiscal 2022, the Company amended, or amended and restated, the 2014 Plan with shareholder approval to\nincrease the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the Plan by an additional 500,000,\n850,000 and 1,000,000 shares, respectively, so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance\nunder the Plan is 2,975,000 shares. The expiration date of the Plan is December 17, 2030, unless the 2014 Plan\nis terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with the approval of the stockholders. The\nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the vesting period at the time of grant.\nAll stock awards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the\nCompany during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period assuming the grantee’s\nstock award fully vests. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of April 1, 2023,\nthere were no accrued dividends. Dividends for stock awards that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nAs of April 1, 2023, under the 2014 Plan, 471,096 time-based shares were outstanding, 100,000 performance-\nbased restricted stock awards were outstanding and 632,094 shares were available for awards thereunder.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Awards\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues time-based restricted stock awards.\nThe following summarizes the activity in the time-based restricted stock awards under the 2014 Plan during the\nthirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023:\nNumber of Weighted\nTime-Based Average\nRestricted Grant Date Fair\nStock Awards Value per Share\nOutstanding non-vested at December 31, 2022 274,939 $3.59\nGranted 262,428 $12.50\nVested (57,669 ) $2.88\nForfeited or expired (8,602 ) $1.55\nOutstanding non-vested at April 1, 2023 471,096 $8.68\nBased on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $11.56 per share on March 31, 2023 (the last\ntrading day prior to April 1, 2023), the intrinsic value of the time-based non-vested restricted stock awards at\nApril 1, 2023 was approximately $5.4 million. As of April 1, 2023, there was approximately $3.2 million of\ntotal unrecognized compensation cost related to time-based restricted stock awards, which is expected to be\nrecognized over the average weighted remaining vesting period of the restricted stock awards through fiscal\n2027.\n19\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Awards\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock awards to its executives.\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics\nas determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee.\nThe following summarizes the activity in the performance-based restricted stock awards during the thirteen\nweeks ended April 1, 2023:\nNumber of\nPerformance- Weighted\nBased Average\nRestricted Grant Date Fair\nStock Awards Value per Share\nOutstanding non-vested at December 31, 2022 225,000 $8.73\nGranted - -\nVested (125,000 ) $6.15\nForfeited or expired - -\nOutstanding non-vested at April 1, 2023 100,000 $11.96\nAs of April 1, 2023, there was one outstanding grant for performance-based restricted stock awards issued to\nBradley Vizi, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. In December 2022, the Company issued a performance-\nbased restricted stock unit grant of 100,000 shares, subject to increase up to 125,000 shares, based on fiscal\n2023 performance (the “2023 Grant”). The Company has not made a determination as to how many shares it\nexpects to issue under the 2023 Grant.\nThe Company assesses at each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable\nand recognizes the expense when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company\nwill then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and\nrecognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later\nmeasurement date, the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock awards deemed as likely to\nvest are deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed.\nShare-based compensation for performance-based equity agreement was $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the\nthirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, respectively.\nDuring the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, the Company awarded 4,762 immediately vested share awards\nat an average price of $10.50. During the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2022, the Company did not award any\nimmediately vested share awards.\n20\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Treasury Stock Transactions\nOn January 13, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of the\nCompany’s common stock up to an amount not to exceed $7.5 million. All of these repurchases are conducted\nunder the safe harbor from liability pursuant to certain market manipulation rules provided by Rule 10b-18\nunder the Securities Exchange act of 1934, as amended. On November 12, 2021, the Company’s Board of\nDirectors further increased the total amount available to repurchase shares up to an amount not to exceed $19.1\nmillion (including the initial $7.5 million authorized on January 13, 2021), consistent with the maximum\nlimitation set forth by the Company’s revolving line of credit. The program is designed to provide the Company\nwith enhanced flexibility over the long term to optimize its capital structure. Shares of the common stock may\nbe repurchased on the open market or through negotiated transactions. The program may be terminated or\nsuspended at any time at the discretion of the Company.\nDuring the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, the Company purchased 640,578 shares at an average price of\n$12.76 per share. During the thirteen week period ended April 2, 2022, the Company purchased 406,480 shares\nat an average price of $6.84 per share. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had $2.0 million available for future\ntreasury stock purchases.\nOn April 25, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors further increased the total amount available to repurchase\nshares by an additional $25.0 million. See Note 17, “Subsequent Events.”\n12. New Accounting Standards and Updates from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\n2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting\ncredit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the\nFASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) -\nAmendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC\nSection on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which\namends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its\namendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022. CECL estimates of expected credit losses on trade receivables over their life will be\nrequired to be recorded at inception, based on historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The Company adopted the standard in its first quarter of 2023. There was no material\nimpact on the results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This standard only applies to contracts and other\ntransactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be\ndiscontinued due to reference rate reform. This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and\nexceptions to accounting guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease entities’ financial\nreporting burdens as the market transitions from the LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative\nreference rates. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the sunset date of Topic\n848. This update defers the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may\nelect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n21\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Segment Information\nThe Company follows ASC 280, “Segment Reporting,” which establishes standards for companies to report\ninformation about operating segments, geographic areas and major customers. The accounting policies of each\nreportable segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note\n1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2022).\nSegment operating income includes selling, general and administrative expenses directly attributable to that\nsegment as well as charges for allocating corporate costs to each of the operating segments.

Segment Information (Continued)\nThe Company derives a majority of its revenue from offices in the United States. Revenues reported for each\noperating segment are all from external customers. The Company is domiciled in the United States and its\nsegments operate in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Europe. Revenue by geographic area for the\nthirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 was as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nApril 1, April 2,\n2023 2022\nRevenue\nUnited States $63,323 $78,793\nCanada 1,581 1,229\nPuerto Rico 1,562 1,220\nEurope 658 719\n$67,124 $81,961\nTotal assets by geographic area as of the reported periods were as follows:\nApril 1, December 31,\n2023 2022\nTotal assets\nUnited States $93,667 $81,558\nCanada 985 1,640\nPuerto Rico 1,882 1,401\nEurope 994 3,365\n$97,528 $87,964\n14. Income Taxes\nThe Company recognized $1.5 million of income tax expense for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, as\ncompared to $2.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective income tax rate for\nthe current period was 27.6% as compared to 27.4% for the comparable prior-year period. The projected fiscal\n2023 income tax rates as of April 1, 2023, were approximately 27.9%, 26.6% and 16.6% in the United States,\nCanada and Europe, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially\nimpact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and European\npretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The comparable prior-year period estimated income tax rates were\n27.7%, 26.7% and 15.1% in the United States, Canada and Europe, respectively.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily\nfrom the effect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to\nthe Company. The actual 2023 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating\nincome earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options\nand vesting of share-based awards.\n23\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n15. Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is a defendant in various legal actions that arise in the ordinary business\ncourse. These matters may relate to professional liability, tax, compensation, contract, competitor disputes, and\nemployee-related matters and include individual and class action lawsuits, as well as inquiries and\ninvestigations by governmental agencies regarding the Company’s employment and compensation practices.\nAdditionally, some of the Company’s clients may also become subject to claims, governmental inquiries and\ninvestigations, and legal actions relating to the Company’s professional services. Depending upon the particular\nfacts and circumstances, the Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations under its contracts\nwith such clients relating to these matters.\nAs such, the Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as\npotential ranges of losses and possible recoveries. The Company may not be covered by insurance as it pertains\nto some or all of these matters. A determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments\nand contingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each matter.\nThe Company records a liability when management believes an adverse outcome from a loss contingency is\nboth probable and the amount, or a range, can be reasonably estimated. From time to time, the Company must\nestimate the potential loss even though the party adverse to the Company has not asserted any specific amounts.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount. The\nCompany reviews its loss contingencies at least quarterly and it adjusts its accruals and/or disclosures to reflect\nthe impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, or other new information, as deemed\nnecessary. Once established, a provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in\ncircumstances. The Company could increase or decrease its earnings in the period that the changes are made.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of April 1, 2023, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss\nhas not been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could\nresult in an unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company\nbelieves that such matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of April 1, 2023, the\nCompany has accrued $2.6 million for asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by\nthe Company is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not\ndetermined if it has any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually\nlimited to an amount no higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found\nliable, any damages would be covered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum\ncoverage of $5.0 million. While the Company attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has\nreserved $0.5 million for this project. The Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3\nmillion or that liability over $0.5 million, if any, will be covered by insurance.\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the\nordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\n24\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n16. Leases\nLeases are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 842, Leases which requires lessees to recognize a right of\nuse (“ROU”) asset and an operating right of use liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months and\nrequires disclosures by lessees and lessors about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from\nleases.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases where the Company is the lessee,\nright of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets and lease\nliabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the\nlease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining\nthe present value of lease payments. The right of use asset also consists of any lease incentives received. The\nlease terms used to calculate the right of use asset and related lease liability include options to extend or\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for\noperating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense while the\nexpense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation expense and interest expense using the accelerated\ninterest method of recognition. The Company has lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-\nlease components. The Company has elected to account for these as a single lease component with the\nexception of its real estate leases.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nApril 1, April 2,\n2023 2022\nOperating lease cost $372 $449\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right of use assets $137 $110\nInterest on lease liabilities $1 $2\nTotal finance lease cost $138 $112\nSupplemental Cash Flow information related to leases was as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nApril 1, April 2,\n2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement\nof lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $380 $478\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $2 $2\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases $116 $91\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for lease\nobligations\nOperating leases $ - $674\nFinance leases $ - $ -\n25\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Subsequent Events\nAmendment and Restatement of Credit Facility\nOn April 24, 2023, the Company and all of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Borrowers”) entered into a Fourth\nAmended and Restated Loan Agreement (the “Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement”) with Citizens\nBank, N.A., as lender (in such capacity, the “Lender”) and as administrative agent and arranger (in such\ncapacity, the “Administrative Agent”), to amend and restate in its entirety that certain Third Amended and\nRestated Agreement dated as of the August 9, 2018 (as the same has been amended and modified prior to the\ndate hereof, the “Existing Loan Agreement”). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this description shall\nhave the respective meanings given to such terms in the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.\nUnder the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, the total commitment remains at $45.0 million, and\npermits the Borrowers to request the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit thereunder. The Fourth\nAmended and Restated Loan Agreement has a maturity date of April 24, 2026. Borrowings under the Fourth\nAmended and Restated Loan Agreement remain collateralized with substantially all of the Company’s assets, as\nwell as the capital stock of its subsidiaries.\nBorrowings under the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement bear interest at one of two alternative\nrates, as selected by the Company at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (the secured\novernight financing rate as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), plus applicable margin, or (ii)\nan Alternate Base Rate, which shall mean for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime\nrate, as announced by the Administrative Agent, in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on\nsuch day plus 0.50% per annum and (c) the Daily SOFR Rate on such day plus 1.00% per annum, provided that\nthe alternate base rate shall at no time be less than the Floor. The amount of the spread depends on the ratio of\nconsolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (which, for purposes of the Fourth Amended and Restated\nLoan Agreement, is defined as the sum of (i) consolidated net income (excluding any realized gains or losses\nfrom foreign exchange transactions) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, (ii) non-cash\ncharges (including, but not limited to, any write-offs of goodwill), and (iii) the net loss if any (expressed as a\npositive number) arising solely from Permitted Asset or Stock Sales (as defined in the Fourth Amended and\nRestated Loan Agreement) up to an amount, which when added to other net losses previously recognized under\nclause (iii) does not exceed $5,000,000.00 in the aggregate, with the Company permitted to add back up to\n$1,000,000 in the aggregate of consulting expenses for analyzing tax credits for research and development costs\nand 179D energy savings tax credits on a rolling four quarter basis.\nThe Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants\nincluding limitations on specified levels of consolidated leverage and consolidated fixed charges, and includes\nlimitations on, among other things, dividends, liens, mergers, consolidations, sales of assets, incurrence of debt\nand capital expenditures. We are also required to pay a monthly unused facility fee on the amount of the Fourth\nAmended and Restated Loan Agreement not drawn which ranges from 10 to 22.5 basis points, depending upon\nthe ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA. Upon the occurrence of an event of default\nunder the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, such as non-payment or failure to observe specific\ncovenants, the Lender would be entitled to declare all amounts outstanding under the Fourth Amended and\nRestated Loan Agreement immediately due and payable.\nThis description of the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement is only a summary and is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the full text of the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, which is attached as\nExhibit 99.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 28, 2023.\n27\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Subsequent Events (Continued)\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nOn April 24, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement for the repurchase, in a private transaction approved\nby the Board, of 333,686 shares of common stock at a per share price equal to $11.91.\nOn April 25, 2023, the Board authorized an additional program to repurchase shares of its common stock up to\nan amount not to exceed $25.0 million. This newly approved program succeeds the Company’s prior\nrepurchase program approved in November 2021, which was substantially completed in April 2023. The\nprogram is designed to provide the Company with enhanced flexibility over the long term to optimize its capital\nstructure. Shares of the Common Stock may be repurchased in the open market or through negotiated\ntransactions. The program may be terminated or suspended at any time at the discretion of the Company. The\nCompany may in the future enter into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to effect a portion of the authorized purchases,\nif criteria set forth in the plan are met. Such a plan would enable the Company to repurchase its shares during\nperiods outside of its normal trading windows, when the Company typically would not be active in the market.\nFor the period subsequent to April 1, 2023 and through May 9, 2023, the Company purchased 595,910 total\nshares of the Company’s common stock as part of its Treasury Stock Repurchase Program, inclusive of the\n333,686 shares purchased in a private transaction, at an average price of $11.92, totaling $7.1 million. As of\nMay 9, 2023, the Company has $23.9 million available for future treasury stock purchases.\n28\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOVID-19 Considerations\nThe Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic and endemic have been protecting the health and safety\nof our employees and, especially in the healthcare segment, deploying our resources, including the talents of our\nemployees, to help the communities we serve meet and overcome the current challenges. In the future, the pandemic\nand endemic may cause reduced demand for our services if, for example, they result in a prolonged recessionary\neconomic environment affecting industries in which we serve; however, since certain services that we offer are\nessential to the daily lives of our customers, we believe that over the long term, there will continue to be demand for\nour services.\nOur ability to continue to operate without any significant negative operational impact from the COVID-19 pandemic\nand endemic will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has\nendeavored to follow the recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees, with\nparticular measures in place for those working in our customer facilities. While our revenue, gross profit and\noperating income were negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 on a consolidated basis and in fiscal 2021 for certain\nbusiness lines, we have maintained the consistency of our operations, to a substantial degree, from the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and endemic. We intend to continue to adhere to our employee safety measures as we seek to\nensure that any disruptions to our operations relating to the pandemic and endemic remain as limited as possible.\nHowever, the uncertainty resulting from the pandemic and endemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our\nworkforce and supply chain (for example, an inability of a key supplier or transportation supplier to source and\ntransport materials) that could negatively impact our operations. Any material changes to labor rates for the\nCompany’s workforce may have a material negative impact to revenue, gross profit and operating income.\n30\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview\nRCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the impact of\neconomic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company’s\nfinancial performance.\nThe Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven\nrecord of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to\noptimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong\nvertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.\nThe Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business\nprocesses to compete in today’s business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing\nbusiness and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses\ntoday are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact\non spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.\nNonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced life sciences,\ninformation technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they\ncan maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage.\nAlthough working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support\nincreasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a\ndemand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate\nthe potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.\nThe Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon\nfixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management\nand solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally\nendeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also\nrealizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical\nconsultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily\nprovided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company’s consultants based upon their\nskill level, experience and the type of work performed.\nThe majority of the Company’s services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the\nmore complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the\nnature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more\ncomplex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally\nterminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days’ notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically, these contracts are for less than one year. The\nCompany recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.\n31\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview (Continued)\nCosts of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and\nemployees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses\nconsist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating\nactivities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries\nand benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company’s corporate marketing,\nadministrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these\nexpenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the\npurpose of segment financial reporting.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our consolidated financial statements,\nestimates are used for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-\nlived intangible assets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock awards, insurance liabilities, accounting for\nincome taxes and accrued bonuses.\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, Note\n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2022. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies require significant, difficult or\ncomplex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. Such policies are summarized in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of the recently issued accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 12, New Accounting Standards\nand Updates from the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.\n32\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nForward-looking Information\nThe Company’s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending\nprograms, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering, life sciences\nand information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company’s\noperating performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, global events such as the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic and endemic also have a substantial impact on our operations and financial results. The Company\nbelieves that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings\nprovides some insulation from adverse trends. However, general economic declines could result in the need for\nfuture cost reductions or changes in strategy.\nAdditionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of\nemployment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with\nrespect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. There can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a\nsufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.\nThe consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company\ncompetes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company’s service\nlines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors\nand customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future,\nwhich could limit the Company’s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.\n33\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended April 1, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended April 2, 2022\nA summary of operating results for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 is as follows (in\nthousands):\nApril 1, 2023 April 2, 2022\n% of % of\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue\nRevenue $67,124 100.0 $81,961 100.0\nCost of services 48,100 71.7 58,541 71.4\nGross profit 19,024 28.3 23,420 28.6\nSelling, general and administrative 13,396 19.9 14,147 17.2\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment 271 0.4 238 0.3\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 45 0.1 - -\nGain on sale of assets (395 ) (0.6 ) - -\nOperating costs and expenses 13,317 19.8 14,385 17.5\nOperating income 5,707 8.5 9,035 11.1\nOther expense, net 407 0.6 52 0.1\nIncome before income taxes 5,300 7.9 8,983 11.0\nIncome tax expense 1,463 2.2 2,463 3.0\nNet income $3,837 5.7 $6,520 8.0\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. The\nfiscal quarters ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 consisted of thirteen weeks each.\nRevenue. Revenue decreased 18.1%, or $14.8 million, for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 as compared to\nthe thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2022 (the “comparable prior-year period”). Revenue decreased $13.0 million in\nthe Specialty Health Care segment, decreased $1.4 million in the Engineering segment and decreased $0.4 million in\nthe Life Sciences and Information Technology segment. See more detailed disclosure by segment in our Segment\nDiscussion.\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services decreased 17.8%, or $10.4 million, for the thirteen weeks\nended April 1, 2023 as compared to the comparable prior-year period. Cost of services decreased primarily due to\nthe increase in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and\nApril 2, 2022 was 71.7% and 71.4%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further information regarding\nchanges in cost of services and gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses were $13.9 million\nfor the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 as compared to $14.1 million for the comparable prior-year period. As a\npercentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 19.9% for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and 17.2% for the\ncomparable prior-year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\n34\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended April 1, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended April 2, 2022 (Continued)\nGain on Sale of Assets. On July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its\nPickering and Kincardine offices, located in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often referred to as Canada\nPower Systems and principally provided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The\ntwo Canada Power Systems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company’s Engineering segment. During\nthe thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, the Company recorded a discrete gain on the sale of these assets and\nliabilities of $0.4 million due to the final collection of escrow funds from the transaction.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on\nthe Company’s line of credit, net of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other\nexpense, net increased by $0.4 million as compared to the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase\nin interest expense, net. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowing. Borrowings increased primarily to\nfund treasury stock purchases.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). The Company recognized $1.5 million of income tax expense for the thirteen\nweeks ended April 1, 2023, as compared to $2.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated\neffective income tax rate for the current period was 27.6% as compared to 27.4% for the comparable prior-year\nperiod. The projected fiscal 2023 income tax rates as of April 1, 2023, were approximately 27.9%, 26.6% and\n16.6% in the United States, Canada, and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each\njurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of\nCanadian and Serbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The effective income tax rate can also be impacted\nby discrete permanent differences affecting any period presented.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the\neffect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company.\nThe actual 2023 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in\nvarious jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-\nbased awards.\n35\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended April 1, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended April 2, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $39.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 decreased 25.0%, or\n$13.0 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue was driven by both the\nCompany’s school and non-school clients. Revenue from school clients for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023\nwas $29.3 million as compared to $41.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from non-school\nclients for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 was $9.8 million as compared to $10.7 million for the comparable\nprior-year period. Revenue decreases were primarily due to decreased demand associated with COVID-19\ntransitioning from the height of the pandemic during the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2022 to an endemic during\nthe thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023. The Specialty Health Care segment’s gross profit decreased by 22.2%, or\n$3.3 million, to $11.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, as compared to $15.0 million for the prior-\nyear period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the decrease in revenue, offset by a higher gross\nprofit margin. Gross profit margin for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 increased to 29.8% as compared to\n28.7% for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the high\ndemand and mix shift for certain higher margin services. Specialty Health Care experienced operating income of\n$4.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, as compared to $6.9 million for the comparable prior-year\nperiod. The primary reason for the decrease in operating income was the decrease to gross profit, offset by a\ndecrease in SGA expense. SGA expense decreased by $0.8 million to $7.2 million, as compared to $8.0 million in\nthe comparable prior-year period. The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a decrease in expenses\nassociated with lower revenue and a lower allocation of primarily fixed corporate expenses.\nThe Company believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic helped to increase Specialty Health Care revenue\nand gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the first half of fiscal 2022. The Company also believes the\nCOVID-19 pandemic began to shift to an endemic in the second half of fiscal 2022. As a result, COVID-19-related\nrevenue has decreased. However, the Company also believes that the demand for its Healthcare services is greater\nthan it typically had been before the COVID-19 pandemic. While the overall impact of these offsetting dynamics is\nuncertain, the Company believes that, except for seasonality, it is well positioned for growth in revenue going\nforward.\n36\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended April 1, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended April 2, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nEngineering\nEngineering revenue of $18.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 decreased 7.1%, or $1.4 million,\ncompared to the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue was comprised of the following: decreases\nin Aerospace revenue of $0.1 million and Industrial Processing revenue of $1.6 million, offset by an increase to\nEnergy Services revenue of $0.3 million. The decrease in Aerospace revenue was primarily due to a contract loss\nfor the Company’s major outsourcing client. The Company believes the decrease in Industrial Processing revenue\nwas primarily due to the haphazard timing of large contracts with its Industrial Processing clients. Gross profit\ndecreased by 22.7%, or $1.2 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit decreased\nbecause of the decrease in revenue and a decrease in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin of 21.9% for the\ncurrent period decreased from 26.3% for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was\nprimarily due to lower utilization associated with lower revenue as the Company absorbed fixed salaried costs over\nlower revenue. The Engineering segment experienced operating income of $0.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended\nApril 1, 2023, as compared to $1.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in operating income\nwas due to the decrease in gross profit, offset by a decrease to SGA expense and discrete gains in the current period.\nThe Engineering segment’s SGA expense of $3.9 million decreased by $0.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in\nexpenses associated with lower revenue. The discrete gain on sale of assets was due to the final collection of escrow\nfunds associated with the sale of the Canadian Power Systems in fiscal 2021.\nLife Sciences and Information Technology\nLife Sciences and Information Technology revenue of $9.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023\ndecreased by $0.4 million, as compared to $9.9 million for the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit of $3.3\nmillion for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 increased 3.8%, or $0.1 million, as compared to $3.2 million for\nthe comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase in gross profit\nmargin. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit margin for the thirteen weeks ended April 1,\n2023 was 34.8% as compared to 32.2% for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes the gross\nprofit margin increase to higher revenue from its RPO offering and a concerted effort to increase gross profit margin\nthrough its managed service offerings. The Life Sciences and Information Technology segment experienced\noperating income of $1.0 million as compared to $1.1 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in\noperating income was primarily due to an increase in SGA expense. SGA expense increased to $2.3 million as\ncompared to $2.1 million in the comparable prior-year period. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due the\nacquisition of TalentHerder in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\n37\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the major captions from the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows (in thousands):\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nApril 1, April 2,\n2023 2022\nCash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities ($832 ) $2,468\nInvesting activities ($332 ) ($217 )\nFinancing activities $2,945 ($1,612 )\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities used $0.8 million of cash for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 as compared to providing\n$2.5 million in the comparable prior-year period. The major components of cash (used in) provided by operating\nactivities in the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and the comparable prior-year period are as follows: net income,\nand changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable, prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs, and\ndeferred revenue.\nFor the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, the Company experienced net income of $3.8 million as compared to\n$6.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. An increase in accounts receivables in the thirteen weeks ended\nApril 1, 2023 used $8.0 million of cash as compared to using $10.2 million in the comparable prior-year period. The\nCompany primarily attributes this increase in accounts receivables for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 to\nnormal fluctuations in accounts receivable relative to revenue.\nWhile highly variable, the Company’s transit accounts payable typically exceeds the Company’s transit accounts\nreceivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course\nof business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable of $8.0 million as\nof April 1, 2023 and a net payable of $6.5 million as of December 31, 2022, providing $1.5 million of cash during\nthe thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net\npayable of $1.6 million as of April 2, 2022 and a net payable of $1.1 million as of January 1, 2022, providing $0.5\nmillion of cash during the thirteen week period ended April 2, 2022.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets provided cash of $1.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023\nas compared to $0.1 million of cash for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes changes to\nprepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of business.\nSince certain expenses are paid before a fiscal year concludes and are amortized over the next fiscal year, prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets generally tend to increase at the end of a fiscal year and decrease during the first\nthree quarters of the following fiscal year.\n38\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nOperating Activities (Continued)\nA decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used cash of $1.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 1,\n2023 as compared to using $1.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes these\nchanges to typical fluctuations in the normal course of business.\nChanges in accrued payroll and related costs provided cash of $2.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 1,\n2023 as compared to $5.4 million for the comparable prior-year period. There are four primary factors that\ngenerally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll\nand related costs is the Company’s largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other\nfactors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two\nweeks and normally has thirteen weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major\npayroll on the last business day of every other quarter; 3) the timing of various payroll related payments varies in the\nnormal course of business; and 4) most of the Company’s senior management participate in annual incentive plans\nand while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent\nthey are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive\nplan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The\nCompany’s last major payroll for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 was paid on March 24, 2023. During fiscal\n2020, the Company deferred $3.3 million of employer payroll taxes under the CARES Act. Half of these deferred\npayroll taxes were paid in fiscal December 2021 and the remaining portion was paid in fiscal December 2022.\nHistorically, the Company has experienced small deferred revenue balances. In fiscal 2022, the Company’s\nIndustrial Processing group secured several contracts with front-loaded payments, thereby generating larger deferred\nrevenue balances than typically generated. As a result, the Company’s deferred revenue balance as of April 1, 2023\nwas $0.8 million, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2022, using cash from operations of $0.3 million for\nthe thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023. While the Company expects to receive future upfront payments from its\nIndustrial Processing clients, the Company cannot reasonably forecast deferred revenue balances as the timing of\ncontract wins and front-loaded payments are typically haphazard.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $0.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment in the current period as compared\nto $0.2 million in the comparable prior-year period.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $2.9 million of cash for the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 as compared to using\n$1.6 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Company made net borrowings under its line of credit of\n$10.4 million during the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 as compared to net borrowings of $1.1 million in the\ncomparable prior-year period. The Company used $7.7 million to repurchase shares of its common stock in the\ncurrent period as compared to $2.8 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Company generated cash of\n$0.3 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and $0.1 million for the comparable\nprior-year period.\n39\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n(which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable margin,\ntypically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day\nincrements or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays\nunused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are\nrecorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the\nthirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 were 6.0% and 1.6%, respectively.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various\nfinancial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order to\npay dividends. As of April 1, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving\nCredit Facility (as amended). The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants\nfor the foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $19.2 million and $8.8 million,\nrespectively. There were letters of credit outstanding at April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 for $2.0 million and\n$1.9 million, respectively. At April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had availability for additional\nborrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $23.8 million and $34.3 million, respectively.\nIn addition to borrowings and sales of shares from its equity plans, the Company may raise capital through sales of\nshares of common stock under its at the market issuance program (the “ATM Program”) established under its May\n2021 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., as the agent (the “Agent”). The ATM\nProgram allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to\n$25.0 million from time to time through the Agent. To date, the Company has not sold any shares under the ATM\nProgram.\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations,\nand meet the other general cash needs of our business. Our liquidity is impacted by general economic, financial,\ncompetitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to\npay our expenses, principally labor-costs, and other related expenditures. We generally satisfy our liquidity needs\nthrough cash provided by operations and, when necessary, our revolving line of credit from Citizens Bank. The\nCompany believes it has a great deal of flexibility to reduce its costs if it becomes necessary. The Company believes\nthat it can satisfy its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months.\n40\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility (Continued)\nThe Company’s liquidity and capital resources as of April 1, 2023, included accounts receivable and total current\nasset balances of $58.8 million and $68.8 million, respectively. Current liabilities were $42.9 million as of April 1,\n2023 and were exceeded by total current assets by $25.9 million.\nThe Company experiences volatility in its daily cash flow and, at times, relies on the revolving line of credit to\nprovide daily liquidity for the Company’s financial operations. As of April 1, 2023, the Company was in\ncompliance with all financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it\nwill maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility was amended and restated as of April 24, 2023. See Note 17, “Subsequent Events,”\nto the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes.\nFunding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from\none or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or\nfuture financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time\nin the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final\noutcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the\nresults of operations.\nThe Company’s business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through\nstrategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates.\nThe Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally\nincluded significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase\nhowever, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such\nopportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No\nassurance can be given as to the Company’s future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such\nopportunities will be financed.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of April 1, 2023, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss has\nnot been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could result in\nan unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company believes that such\nmatters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of April 1, 2023, the Company has accrued $2.6 million\nfor asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the\nCompany is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not determined if it\nhas any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually limited to an amount\nno higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found liable, any damages would be\ncovered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum coverage of $5.0 million. While the\nCompany attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has reserved $0.5 million for this project.\nThe Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3 million or that liability over $0.5 million, if\nany, will be covered by insurance.\n41\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCommitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the\nordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\nThe Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in\n1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company is currently\nimplementing an upgrade of its current system and expects to go live in 2024. The Company estimates this upgrade\nor replacement of its financial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\nThese estimates are subject to material change.\nThe Company’s current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes\nthat its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of\nbusiness for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates\nthrough November 2027. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nOperating Finance\nFiscal Year Leases Leases\n2023 (After April 1, 2023) $1,080 $350\n2024 754 233\n2025 493 -\n2026 409 -\n2027 302 -\nThereafter 1,455 -\nTotal lease payments 4,493 583\nLess: imputed interest (559 ) (4 )\nTotal $3,934 $579\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of April 1, 2023, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets of\nThermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, “TKE”), and 2) effective\nOctober 2, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates future\ncontingent payments at April 1, 2023 as follows:\nTotal\nThe four quarters following April 1, 2023 $472\nThereafter 1,970\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $2,442\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of April 1, 2023. Contingent consideration\nrelated to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other (expense)\nincome, net.\n42\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment\nportfolio and debt instruments, which primarily consist of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company does not\nhave any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio. The Company places its investments in instruments that\nmeet high credit quality standards. The Company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation\nof its invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. As of April 1, 2023, the Company’s\ninvestments consisted of cash and money market funds. The Company does not use interest rate derivative\ninstruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the Company’s variable-rate line of credit\nbalances during the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, if the interest rate on the Company’s variable-rate line of\ncredit (using an incremental borrowing rate) during the period had been 1.0% higher, the Company’s interest\nexpense on an annualized basis would have increased by $0.2 million. The Company does not expect any material\nloss with respect to its investment portfolio.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Principal\nExecutive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period\ncovered by this report. As previously disclosed under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures” in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we identified deficiencies described below that existed as\nof December 31, 2022, and continued to exist at April 1, 2023. Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive\nOfficer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as\nsuch term is defined in Rule(s) 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of April 1,\n2023, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements\nwill not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement identified the following control deficiencies that resulted in material weaknesses in our internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The Company did not design and maintain information\ntechnology controls relevant to preparing its financial statements, specifically concerning (i) separation of duties to\nthe SAP ERP and General Ledger, (ii) adequate restriction of administrator-type access to SAP, (iii) program change\nmanagement controls, and (iv) user access controls that ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately\nrestrict user access to financial applications, programs, and data. As a result, the Company's related process-level IT-\ndependent manual and automated controls that rely upon the affected ITGCs, or information coming from IT\nsystems with affected ITGCs, were also deemed ineffective.\nThis material weakness did not result in a misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements.\n43\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (CONTINUED)\nPlanned Material Weakness Remediation Activities\nTo address these material weaknesses, we have commenced actions to formalize the Company's framework and\npolicies to maintain evidence in the operation of control procedures and improve our IT general controls. Our\nplanned remediation efforts related to the above-identified material weaknesses include, but are not limited to:\n Investments to upgrade or replace existing systems that do not have the appropriate infrastructure to meet\nthe requirements of our internal control framework.\n Expand the available resources at the Company with experience designing and implementing control\nactivities, including information technology general controls, with the advice from of third-party\nconsultants and specialists.\n Assess segregation of duties and implement an annual user access review, including role design and\nprocess transformation to appropriately mitigate significant risks associated with conflicting responsibilities\nin financial systems.\n Design and implement IT controls in change management that will ensure all changes are tested in staging,\napproved, and documented, and ensure that developers cannot deploy their own code to production.\n Perform additional training to ensure a clear understanding of risk assessment, controls, and monitoring\nactivities related to automated processes, systems, and ITGCs related to financial reporting.\nWe will continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and take steps to\nremediate the known material weaknesses expeditiously. The implementation of these remediation efforts is in\nprogress, may require additional expenditures to implement, and will require validation and testing of the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles, and as a result, the\ntiming of when we will be able to remediate the material weaknesses fully is uncertain. We may also conclude that\nadditional measures may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting, which may necessitate further implementation and evaluation time.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the material weaknesses and remediation efforts described above, there have been no changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that\noccurred during the thirteen weeks ended April 1, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n44\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements of RCM Technologies, Inc. and\nsubsidiaries (“RCM” or the “Company”) are unaudited. The year-end consolidated balance sheet was derived\nfrom the Company’s audited statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States. These statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission pertaining to reports on Form 10-Q and should be read\nin conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report Form 10-K for such period. Certain information\nand footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all\nadjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows for such interim periods.\nResults for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 are not necessarily indicative\nof results that may be expected for the full year or any future period.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31.\nBoth the current fiscal year ending December 30, 2023 (fiscal 2023) and the prior fiscal year ended December\n31, 2022 (fiscal 2022) are 52-week reporting years. The fiscal quarters for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 align as\nfollows:\nFiscal 2023 Quarters Weeks Fiscal 2022 Quarters Weeks\nApril 1, 2023 Thirteen April 2, 2022 Thirteen\nJuly 1, 2023 Thirteen July 2, 2022 Thirteen\nSeptember 30, 2023 Thirteen October 1, 2022 Thirteen\nDecember 30, 2023 Thirteen December 31, 2022 Thirteen\n9\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n2. Use of Estimates and Uncertainties\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe Company uses estimates to determine an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable,\nlitigation, medical claims, vacation, goodwill impairment, if any, equity compensation, the tax rate applied and\nthe valuation of certain assets and liability accounts. In addition, the Company reviews its estimated costs to\ncomplete a contract and adjusts those costs when necessary. These estimates can be significant to the operating\nresults and financial position of the Company. The estimates are based upon various factors including current\nand historical trends, as well as other pertinent industry and regulatory authority information. Management\nregularly evaluates this information to determine if it is necessary to update the basis for its estimates and to\nadjust for known changes.\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care\ninsurance. The amounts included in the Company’s costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can\nvary based on changes in assumptions, the Company’s claims experience or the providers included in the\nassociated insurance programs.\nThe Company can be affected by a variety of factors including uncertainty relating to the performance of the\ngeneral economy, competition, demand for the Company’s services, adverse litigation and claims and the\nhiring, training and retention of key employees.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s carrying value of financial instruments, consisting primarily of accounts receivable, transit\naccounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, transit accounts payable and borrowings under\nline of credit approximates fair value due to their liquidity or their short-term nature and the line of credit’s\nvariable interest rate. The Company does not have derivative products in place to manage risks related to\nforeign currency fluctuations for its foreign operations or for interest rate changes.\nThe Company re-measures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period and any\nchange in the fair value from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, is\nrecorded in earnings in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\n10\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring\nservices promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to\nreceive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate\nservice streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the\ncontract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the\ntransaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize\nrevenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company’s Engineering Services, Life Sciences\nand Information Technology segments perform consulting and project solution services. The Healthcare\nsegment specializes in long-term and short-term staffing and placement services to hospitals, schools and long-\nterm care facilities amongst others. All of the Company’s segments perform staff augmentation services and\nderive revenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company’s revenue is invoiced on a time\nand materials basis.\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue source for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks\nended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022:\nThirteen Twenty-Six\nWeeks Ended Weeks Ended\nJuly 1, July 2, July 1, July 2,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nSpecialty Health Care:\nTime and Material $35,276 $43,045 $74,110 $95,068\nPermanent Placement Services 252 412 548 573\nTotal Specialty Health Care $35,528 $43,457 $74,658 $95,641\nEngineering:\nTime and Material $11,557 $11,471 $22,027 $22,146\nFixed Fee 9,457 9,435 17,477 18,658\nTotal Engineering $21,014 $20,906 $39,504 $40,804\nLife Sciences and Information Technology:\nTime and Material $8,624 $9,101 $16,858 $18,257\nPermanent Placement Services 133 695 247 1,241\nFixed Fee 1,736 187 2,892 364\nTotal Life Sciences and Information Technology $10,493 $9,983 $19,997 $19,862\n$67,035 $74,346 $134,159 $156,307\n11\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition (Continued)\nTime and Material\nThe Company’s Health Care segment predominantly recognizes revenue through time and material work while\nits Engineering and Life Sciences and Information Technology segments recognize revenue through both time\nand material and fixed fee work. The Company’s time and material contracts are typically based on the number\nof hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials\ncontracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed Fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of\nits customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements\nare typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that\nfixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company’s fixed fee\npurchase orders are typically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are\nprovided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain\ninstances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue\nunder these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. From time-to-time,\namounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAdditionally, some contracts contain “Performance Fees” (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget.\nPerformance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified\nmaximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined.\nFor contracts where there is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the revenue is not\nrecognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the\nrelated revenue is recognized.\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are\ntypically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company’s client. The\nCompany guarantees its permanent placements on a prorated basis for 90 days. In the event a candidate is not\nretained for the 90-day period, the Company will provide a suitable replacement candidate. In the event a\nreplacement candidate cannot be located, the Company will provide a prorated refund to the client. An\nallowance for refunds, based upon the Company’s historical experience, is recorded in the financial statements.\nDeferred Revenue\nThere was $0.5 million of deferred revenue as of July 1, 2023. Deferred revenue was $1.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be\nrecognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet, although this is\nan infrequent occurrence. For the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022, the Company recognized\nrevenue of $0.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of\nthe reporting period. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022, the Company recognized\nrevenue of $1.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of\nthe reporting period.\n12\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition (Continued)\nConcentration\nDuring the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023, the Company had one customer exceed 10% of consolidated\nrevenue, representing 18.7% of consolidated revenue. During the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022, the\nCompany had two customers exceed 10% of consolidated revenue, representing 20.4% and 13.9% of\nconsolidated revenue. In both periods presented, the customers are included in the Company’s Specialty Health\nCare segment.\n4. Accounts Receivable, Transit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payable\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are comprised of the following:\nJuly 1, December 31,\n2023 2022\nBilled $49,694 $40,256\nUnbilled 8,372 6,615\nWork-in-progress 4,648 4,991\nAllowance for sales discounts and doubtful accounts (1,100 ) (1,100 )\nAccounts receivable, net $61,614 $50,762\nUnbilled receivables primarily represent revenue earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the\nbalance sheet ending date. Work-in-progress primarily represents revenue earned under contracts which the\nCompany contractually invoices at future dates.\nFrom time to time, the Company’s Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things,\nconstruction management and engineering services. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may engage\nsubcontractors to provide construction or other services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project\nvalue; and c) assumes no ownership or risks of inventory. In such situations, the Company acts as an agent\nunder the provisions of FASB ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and therefore recognizes\nrevenue on a “net-basis.” The Company records revenue on a “net” basis on relevant engineering and\nconstruction management projects, which require subcontractor/procurement costs or transit costs. In those\nsituations, the Company charges the client a negotiated fee, which is reported as net revenue when earned.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the\ncorresponding payment from the Company’s end-client is received. Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of\nthe subcontractor or staffing agency, the Company records this amount simultaneously as both a “transit\naccount receivable” and “transit account payable,” as the amount when paid to the Company is due to and\ngenerally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The Company typically does not pay a given transit\naccount payable until the related transit account receivable is collected. The Company is typically obligated to\npay the subcontractor or staffing agency whether or not the client pays the Company. The Company’s transit\naccounts payable generally exceeds the Company’s transit accounts receivable but absolute amounts and\nspreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The transit accounts\nreceivable was $9.9 million and related transit accounts payable was $37.1 million, for a net payable of $27.2\nmillion, as of July 1, 2023. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net\npayable of $6.5 million as of December 31, 2022 as compared to a net payable of $1.1 million as of January 1,\n2022.\n13\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and are depreciated\nor amortized on the straight-line method at rates calculated to provide for retirement of assets at the end of their\nestimated useful lives. Computer hardware and software, and furniture and office equipment are typically\ndepreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the\nasset or the lease term.\nProperty and equipment are comprised of the following:\nJuly 1, December 31,\n2023 2022\nComputers and systems $3,635 $4,077\nEquipment and furniture 259 220\nLeasehold improvements 388 267\nLaboratory equipment 140 67\n4,421 4,630\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization 2,263 2,532\nProperty and equipment, net $2,158 $2,098\nThe Company periodically writes off fully depreciated and amortized assets. The Company wrote off fully\ndepreciated and amortized assets of $601 and $603 during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2,\n2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for the thirteen weeks\nended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 was $242 and $225, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense\nof property and equipment for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 was $513 and $463,\nrespectively.\n6. Acquisitions and Divestitures\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of July 1, 2023, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain\nassets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, “TKE”), and 2)\neffective October 2, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates\nfuture contingent payments at July 1, 2023 as follows:\nTotal\nThe four quarters following July 1, 2023 $300\nThereafter 1,671\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $1,971\n14\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Acquisitions and Divestitures (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments (Continued)\nFor acquisitions that involve contingent consideration, the Company records a liability equal to the fair value of\nthe estimated contingent consideration obligation as of the acquisition date. The Company determines the\nacquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on the likelihood of paying the additional\nconsideration. The fair value is estimated using projected future operating results and the corresponding future\nearn-out payments that can be earned upon the achievement of specified operating objectives and financial\nresults by acquired companies using Level 3 inputs and the amounts are then discounted to present value. These\nliabilities are measured quarterly at fair value, and any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration\nliability is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. During the measurement period, which may\nbe up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\nperiod or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of July 1, 2023. Contingent\nconsideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in\nother (expense) income, net.\nPotential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after July 1, 2023 are capped at a\ncumulative maximum of $11.6 million. The Company paid $0.5 million and $0.1 million of contingent\nconsideration during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022, respectively. The contingent\nconsideration paid in the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 included $0.1 million of the Company's common\nstock.\n7. Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in\nbusiness combinations. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the\nCompany's fiscal year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value\nof goodwill may be below the carrying amount. The Company reviewed industry and market conditions,\nreporting unit specific events as well as overall financial performance and determined that no indicators of\nimpairment of goodwill existed during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023. As such, no impairment loss\non the Company’s intangible assets during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 was recorded as a result of\nsuch review.\nThe carrying amount of goodwill as of July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was as follows:\nSpecialty Information\nEngineering Health Care Technology Total\n$11,918 $2,398 $7,831 $22,147\n15\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n8. Line of Credit\nOn April 24, 2023, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the “Fourth\nAmended and Restated Loan Agreement”) with Citizens Bank, N.A., as lender (in such capacity, the “Lender”)\nand as administrative agent and arranger (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), to amend and restate in\nits entirety that certain Third Amended and Restated Agreement dated as of the August 9, 2018 (as the same has\nbeen amended and modified prior to the date hereof, the “Existing Loan Agreement”).\nThe Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for a $45.0 million revolving credit facility (the\n“Revolving Credit Facility”), has no sub-limit for letters of credit, and expires on April 24, 2026.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n(which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable\nmargin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-\nday increments or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company\nalso pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line\nfees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees,\nfor the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 were 6.3% and 1.9%, respectively.\nAll borrowings under the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement remain collateralized with\nsubstantially all of the Company’s assets, as well as the capital stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit\nFacility also contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the\nCompany’s ability to borrow in order to pay dividends. As of July 1, 2023, the Company was in compliance\nwith all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain\ncompliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $14.9 million and $8.8\nmillion, respectively. There were letters of credit outstanding at July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 for $2.0\nmillion and $1.9 million, respectively. At July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had availability\nfor additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $28.1 million and $34.3 million, respectively.\n9. Per Share Data\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares outstanding used for\ndiluted earnings per share. The number of weighted-average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings\nper share for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 was determined as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended\nJuly 1, July 2, July 1, July 2,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 8,297,521 10,133,279 8,734,848 10,181,895\nDilutive effect of outstanding restricted share awards 260,875 417,617 241,866 401,624\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 8,558,396 10,550,896 8,976,714 10,583,519\nFor all periods presented, there were no anti-dilutive shares included in the calculation of common stock\nequivalents as there were no stock options outstanding.\n16\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n9. Per Share Data (Continued)\nUnissued shares of common stock were reserved for the following purposes:\nJuly 1, December 31,\n2023 2022\nTime-based restricted stock awards outstanding 497,561 274,939\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards outstanding 100,000 -\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards outstanding\nunder plans to be approved by the shareholders - 225,000\nFuture grants of options or shares 605,629 890,682\nShares reserved for employee stock purchase plan 331,160 364,231\nTotal 1,534,350 1,754,852\n10. Share-Based Compensation\nAt July 1, 2023, the Company had two share-based employee compensation plans, the Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan and the 2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.\nThe Company measures the fair value of share-based awards, if and when granted, based on the Black-Scholes\nmethod and using the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Awards\ntypically vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within 10 years of issuance. The Company\nmay also issue immediately vested equity awards. Share-based compensation expense related to time-based\nawards is amortized in accordance with applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. The\nCompany expenses performance-based awards only when the performance metrics are likely to be achieved and\nthe associated awards are therefore likely to vest. Performance-based share awards that are likely to vest are\nalso expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period but may vest on a retroactive basis or be reversed,\ndepending on when it is determined that they are likely to vest, or in the case of a reversal when they are later\ndetermined to be unlikely to vest or forfeited.\nShare-based compensation expense for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 was $471 and\n$302, respectively. Share-based compensation expense for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2,\n2022 was $967 and $705, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense in the Company’s statement of operations.\nAs of July 1, 2023, the Company had $3.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, with approximately\n$3.5 million related to time-based non-vested share-based awards outstanding and $0.3 million related to\nperformance-based non-vested share-based awards outstanding. The Company expects to recognize the expense\nassociated with time-based non-vested share-based awards through fiscal 2027. If earned, the Company will\nrecognize the expense associated with performance-based non-vested share-based awards straight-line through\nfiscal 2023. These amounts do not include a) the cost of any additional share-based awards granted in future\nperiods or b) the impact of any potential changes in the Company’s forfeiture rate.\n17\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\nIncentive Share-Based Plans\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company implemented the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) with shareholder\napproval, effective January 1, 2001. Under the Purchase Plan, employees meeting certain specific employment\nqualifications are eligible to participate and can purchase shares of common stock semi-annually through\npayroll deductions at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the commencement or end of the\noffering period. The purchase plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock through\npayroll deductions for up to 10% of qualified compensation, subject to maximum purchases in any one fiscal\nyear of 3,000 shares.\nIn fiscal 2015, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,100,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Purchase Plan to December 31, 2025. In fiscal 2018,\nthe Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares\nof stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000 shares so that the\ntotal number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be 1,400,000 shares. In\nfiscal 2021, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 400,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,800,000 shares and the termination date of the Purchase Plan was extended to December 31, 2030.\nThe Company has two offering periods in the Purchase Plan coinciding with the Company’s first two fiscal\nquarters and the last two fiscal quarters. Actual shares are issued on the first business day of the subsequent\noffering period for the prior offering period payroll deductions. The number of shares issued on January 3,\n2023 (the first business day following the previous offering period) was 33,071. As of July 1, 2023, there were\n331,160 shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Compensation expense, representing the\ndiscount to the quoted market price, for the Purchase Plan for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July\n2, 2022 was $160 and $119, respectively.\n18\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\n2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan)\nThe 2014 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in December 2014, initially provided for the issuance\nof up to 625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to officers, non-employee directors, employees of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries, or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company. In fiscal 2016, fiscal 2020\nand fiscal 2022, the Company amended, or amended and restated, the 2014 Plan with shareholder approval to\nincrease the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the Plan by an additional 500,000,\n850,000 and 1,000,000 shares, respectively, so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance\nunder the Plan is 2,975,000 shares. The expiration date of the Plan is December 17, 2030, unless the 2014 Plan\nis terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with the approval of the stockholders. The\nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the vesting period at the time of grant.\nAll stock awards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the\nCompany during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period assuming the grantee’s\nstock award fully vests. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of July 1, 2023,\nthere were no accrued dividends. Dividends for stock awards that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nAs of July 1, 2023, under the 2014 Plan, 497,561 time-based shares were outstanding, 100,000 performance-\nbased restricted stock awards were outstanding and 605,629 shares were available for awards thereunder.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Awards\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues time-based restricted stock awards. The following summarizes the\nactivity in the time-based restricted stock awards under the 2014 Plan during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1,\n2023:\nNumber of Weighted\nTime-Based Average\nRestricted Grant Date Fair\nStock Awards Value per Share\nOutstanding non-vested at December 31, 2022 274,939 $3.59\nGranted 288,893 $13.00\nVested (57,669 ) $2.88\nForfeited or expired (8,602 ) $1.55\nOutstanding non-vested at July 1, 2023 497,561 $9.17\nBased on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $18.40 per share on June 30, 2023 (the last\ntrading day prior to July 1, 2023), the intrinsic value of the time-based non-vested restricted stock awards at\nJuly 1, 2023 was approximately $9.2 million. As of July 1, 2023, there was approximately $3.5 million of total\nunrecognized compensation cost related to time-based restricted stock awards, which is expected to be\nrecognized over the average weighted remaining vesting period of the restricted stock awards through fiscal\n2027.\n19\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Awards\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock awards to its executives.\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics\nas determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee.\nThe following summarizes the activity in the performance-based restricted stock awards during the twenty-six\nweeks ended July 1, 2023:\nNumber of\nPerformance- Weighted\nBased Average\nRestricted Grant Date Fair\nStock Awards Value per Share\nOutstanding non-vested at December 31, 2022 225,000 $8.73\nGranted - -\nVested (125,000 ) $6.15\nForfeited or expired - -\nOutstanding non-vested at July 1, 2023 100,000 $11.96\nAs of July 1, 2023, there was one outstanding grant for performance-based restricted stock awards issued to\nBradley Vizi, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. In December 2022, the Company issued a performance-\nbased restricted stock unit grant of 100,000 shares, subject to increase up to 125,000 shares, based on fiscal\n2023 performance (the “2023 Grant”). The Company has not made a determination as to how many shares it\nexpects to issue under the 2023 Grant.\nThe Company assesses at each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable\nand recognizes the expense when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company\nwill then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and\nrecognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later\nmeasurement date, the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock awards deemed as likely to\nvest are deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed.\nShare-based compensation for performance-based equity agreement was $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the\nthirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022, respectively. Share-based compensation for performance-\nbased equity agreement was $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July\n2, 2022, respectively\nDuring the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023, the Company awarded 4,762 immediately vested share awards\nat an average price of $10.50.

Treasury Stock Transactions\nOn April 25, 2023, the Board authorized a program to repurchase shares of its common stock up to an amount\nnot to exceed $25.0 million. This newly approved program succeeds the Company’s prior repurchase program\nauthorized in November 2021, which was substantially completed in April 2023. The program is designed to\nprovide the Company with enhanced flexibility over the long term to optimize its capital structure. Shares of\nthe Common Stock may be repurchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions. The program\nmay be terminated or suspended at any time at the discretion of the Company. The Company may enter into a\nRule 10b5-1 trading plan to effect a portion of the authorized purchases if the criteria set forth in the plan are\nmet. Such a plan would enable the Company to repurchase its shares during periods outside of its normal\ntrading windows when the Company typically would not be active in the market.\nOn April 24, 2023, the Company agreed to repurchase, in a private transaction approved by the Board, 333,686\nshares of common stock at a per-share price of $11.91 per share.\nDuring the twenty-six weeks ending July 1, 2023, the Company purchased 1,579,732 shares at an average price\nof $13.53 per share, including the aforementioned private transaction. During the twenty-six weeks ending July\n2, 2022, the Company purchased 406,480 shares at an average price of $6.84. As of July 1, 2023, the Company\nhad $18.3 million available for future treasury stock purchases.\nThe Company accrued $0.2 million in excise tax associated with its Treasury Stock Repurchase Plan during the\ntwenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023.\n12. New Accounting Standards and Updates from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\n2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting\ncredit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the\nFASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) -\nAmendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC\nSection on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which\namends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its\namendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022. CECL estimates of expected credit losses on trade receivables over their life will be\nrequired to be recorded at inception, based on historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The Company adopted the standard in its first quarter of 2023. There was no material\nimpact on the results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This standard only applies to contracts and other\ntransactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be\ndiscontinued due to reference rate reform. This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and\nexceptions to accounting guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease entities’ financial\nreporting burdens as the market transitions from the LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative\nreference rates. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the sunset date of Topic\n848. This update defers the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may\nelect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n21\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The consolidated effective income tax rate for\nthe current period was 26.4% as compared to 27.1% for the comparable prior-year period. The projected fiscal\n2023 income tax rates as of July 1, 2023, were approximately 26.8%, 25.9% and 11.7% in the United States,\nCanada and Europe, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially\nimpact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and European\npretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The comparable prior-year period estimated income tax rates were\n27.5%, 23.6% and 15.6% in the United States, Canada and Europe, respectively.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily\nfrom the effect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to\nthe Company. The actual 2023 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating\nincome earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options\nand vesting of share-based awards.\n24\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n15. Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is a defendant in various legal actions that arise in the ordinary business\ncourse. These matters may relate to professional liability, tax, compensation, contract, competitor disputes, and\nemployee-related matters and include individual and class action lawsuits, as well as inquiries and\ninvestigations by governmental agencies regarding the Company’s employment and compensation practices.\nAdditionally, some of the Company’s clients may also become subject to claims, governmental inquiries and\ninvestigations, and legal actions relating to the Company’s professional services. Depending upon the particular\nfacts and circumstances, the Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations under its contracts\nwith such clients relating to these matters.\nAs such, the Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as\npotential ranges of losses and possible recoveries. The Company may not be covered by insurance as it pertains\nto some or all of these matters. A determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments\nand contingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each matter.\nThe Company records a liability when management believes an adverse outcome from a loss contingency is\nboth probable and the amount, or a range, can be reasonably estimated. From time to time, the Company must\nestimate the potential loss even though the party adverse to the Company has not asserted any specific amounts.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount. The\nCompany reviews its loss contingencies at least quarterly and it adjusts its accruals and/or disclosures to reflect\nthe impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, or other new information, as deemed\nnecessary. Once established, a provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in\ncircumstances. The Company could increase or decrease its earnings in the period that the changes are made.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of July 1, 2023, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss\nhas not been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could\nresult in an unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company\nbelieves that such matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of July 1, 2023, the Company\nhas accrued $2.8 million for asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by\nthe Company is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not\ndetermined if it has any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually\nlimited to an amount no higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found\nliable, any damages would be covered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum\ncoverage of $5.0 million. While the Company attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has\nreserved $0.5 million for this project. The Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3\nmillion or that liability over $0.5 million, if any, will be covered by insurance.\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the\nordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\n25\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n16. Leases\nLeases are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 842, Leases which requires lessees to recognize a right of\nuse (“ROU”) asset and an operating right of use liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months and\nrequires disclosures by lessees and lessors about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from\nleases.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases where the Company is the lessee,\nright of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets and lease\nliabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the\nlease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining\nthe present value of lease payments. The right of use asset also consists of any lease incentives received. The\nlease terms used to calculate the right of use asset and related lease liability include options to extend or\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for\noperating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense while the\nexpense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation expense and interest expense using the accelerated\ninterest method of recognition. The Company has lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-\nlease components. The Company has elected to account for these as a single lease component with the\nexception of its real estate leases.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended\nJuly 1, July 2, July 1, July 2,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nOperating lease cost $357 $432 $729 $881\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right of use assets $115 $106 $252 $216\nInterest on lease liabilities 1 2 2 4\nTotal finance lease cost $116 $108 $254 $220\nSupplemental Cash Flow information related to leases was as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended\nJuly 1, July 2, July 1, July 2,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement\nof lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $363 $437 $743 $915\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $1 $4 $3 $6\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases $115 $180 $231 $271\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for lease\nobligations\nOperating leases - $58 - $732\nFinance leases - - - -\n26\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview\nRCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the impact of\neconomic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company’s\nfinancial performance.\nThe Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven\nrecord of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to\noptimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong\nvertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.\nThe Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business\nprocesses to compete in today’s business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing\nbusiness and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses\ntoday are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact\non spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.\nNonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced life sciences,\ninformation technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they\ncan maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage.\nAlthough working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support\nincreasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a\ndemand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate\nthe potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.\nThe Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon\nfixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management\nand solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally\nendeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also\nrealizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical\nconsultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily\nprovided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company’s consultants based upon their\nskill level, experience and the type of work performed.\nThe majority of the Company’s services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the\nmore complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the\nnature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more\ncomplex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally\nterminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days’ notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically, these contracts are for less than one year. The\nCompany recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.\n29\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview (Continued)\nCosts of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and\nemployees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses\nconsist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating\nactivities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries\nand benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company’s corporate marketing,\nadministrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these\nexpenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the\npurpose of segment financial reporting.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our consolidated financial statements,\nestimates are used for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-\nlived intangible assets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock awards, insurance liabilities, accounting for\nincome taxes and accrued bonuses.\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, Note\n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2022. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies require significant, difficult or\ncomplex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. Such policies are summarized in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of the recently issued accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 12, New Accounting Standards\nand Updates from the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.\n30\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nForward-looking Information\nThe Company’s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending\nprograms, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering, life sciences\nand information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company’s\noperating performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, global events such as the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic and endemic also have a substantial impact on our operations and financial results. The Company\nbelieves that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings\nprovides some insulation from adverse trends. However, general economic declines could result in the need for\nfuture cost reductions or changes in strategy.\nAdditionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of\nemployment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with\nrespect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. There can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a\nsufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.\nThe consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company\ncompetes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company’s service\nlines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors\nand customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future,\nwhich could limit the Company’s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.\n31\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended July 1, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended July 2, 2022\nA summary of operating results for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 is as follows (in\nthousands):\nJuly 1, 2023 July 2, 2022\n% of % of\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue\nRevenue $67,035 100.0 $74,346 100.0\nCost of services 48,275 72.0 52,663 70.8\nGross profit 18,760 28.0 21,683 29.2\nSelling, general and administrative 12,273 18.9 13,264 18.1\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment 242 0.4 225 0.3\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 46 0.1 - 0.0\nOperating costs and expenses 13,011 19.4 13,489 18.4\nOperating income 5,749 8.6 8,194 11.2\nOther expense, net 418 0.7 (28 ) 0.0\nIncome before income taxes 5,331 7.9 8,222 11.2\nIncome tax expense 1,348 2.0 2,208 3.0\nNet income $3,983 5.9 $6,014 8.2\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. The\nfiscal quarters ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 consisted of thirteen weeks each.\nRevenue. Revenue decreased 9.8%, or $7.3 million, for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 as compared to the\nthirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 (the “comparable prior-year period”). Revenue decreased $7.9 million in the\nSpecialty Health Care segment, increased $0.1 million in the Engineering segment and increased $0.5 million in the\nLife Sciences and Information Technology segment. See more detailed disclosure by segment in our Segment\nDiscussion.\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services decreased 8.3%, or $4.4 million, for the thirteen weeks ended\nJuly 1, 2023 as compared to the comparable prior-year period. Cost of services decreased primarily due to the\ndecrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July\n2, 2022 was 72.0% and 70.8%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further information regarding changes in\ncost of services and gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses were $12.3 million\nfor the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 as compared to $13.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. As a\npercentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 18.9% for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 and 18.1% for the\ncomparable prior-year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\n32\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended July 1, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 (Continued)\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on\nthe Company’s line of credit, net of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other\nexpense, net increased by $0.4 million as compared to the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase\nin interest expense, net. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowing. Borrowings increased primarily to\nfund treasury stock purchases.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company recognized $1.3 million of income tax expense for the thirteen weeks ended\nJuly 1, 2023, as compared to $2.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective income\ntax rate for the current period was 25.3% as compared to 26.9% for the comparable prior-year period. The projected\nfiscal 2023 income tax rates as of July 1, 2023, were approximately 25.8%, 24.8% and 10.1% in the United States,\nCanada, and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact\nthe overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax income\nversus U.S. pretax income. The effective income tax rate can also be impacted by discrete permanent differences\naffecting any period presented.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the\neffect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company.\nThe actual 2023 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in\nvarious jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-\nbased awards.\n33\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended July 1, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $35.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 decreased 18.2%, or $7.9\nmillion, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue was driven by both the\nCompany’s school and non-school clients. Revenue from school clients for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023\nwas $26.5 million as compared to $32.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from non-school\nclients for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 was $9.0 million as compared to $11.2 million for the comparable\nprior-year period. Revenue decreases were primarily due to decreased demand associated with COVID-19\ntransitioning from a high level of activity relating to the pandemic during the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 to a\nlesser level activity associated with the change of COVID-19 to an endemic during the thirteen weeks ended July 1,\n2023. The Specialty Health Care segment’s gross profit decreased by 23.9%, or $3.1 million, to $9.8 million for the\nthirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023, as compared to $12.9 million for the prior-year period. The decrease in gross\nprofit was primarily driven by the decrease in revenue and a decrease in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin for\nthe thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 decreased to 27.6% as compared to 29.6% for the comparable prior-year\nperiod. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to a mix shift to lower margin services. Specialty\nHealth Care experienced operating income of $3.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023, as compared to\n$5.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the decrease in operating income was the\ndecrease in gross profit, offset by a decrease in SGA expense. SGA expense decreased by $1.2 million to $6.0\nmillion, as compared to $7.2 million in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in SGA expense was\nprimarily due to a decrease in expenses associated with lower revenue and a lower allocation of corporate SGA\nexpenses.\nThe Company believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic helped to increase Specialty Health Care revenue\nand gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the first half of fiscal 2022. The Company also believes the\nCOVID-19 pandemic began to shift to an endemic in the second half of fiscal 2022. As a result, COVID-19-related\nrevenue has decreased. However, the Company also believes that the demand for its Healthcare services is greater\nthan it typically had been before the COVID-19 pandemic. While the overall impact of these offsetting dynamics is\nuncertain, the Company believes that, except for seasonality, it is well positioned for growth in revenue going\nforward.\n34\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended July 1, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nEngineering\nEngineering revenue of $21.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023, increased 0.5%, or $0.1 million,\ncompared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue comprised the following: an increase in\nEnergy Services revenue of $2.1 million, offset by decreases in Aerospace revenue of $1.5 million and Industrial\nProcessing revenue of $0.7 million. Aerospace revenue decreased primarily due to a contract reduction for the\nCompany’s major outsourcing client. The Company believes the decrease in Industrial Processing revenue was\nprimarily due to the irregular timing of large contracts with its Industrial Processing clients. Gross profit decreased\nby 12.5%, or $0.7 million, compared to the prior-year period. Gross profit decreased because of a decrease in gross\nprofit margin. The gross profit margin of 22.9% for the current period decreased from 26.4% for the comparable\nprior-year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower utilization resulting from an\nincrease in staff in anticipation of higher revenue. The Engineering segment experienced operating income of $0.3\nmillion for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023, as compared to $1.3 million for the comparable prior-year period.\nThe operating income decreased due to the decline in gross profit and increased SGA expense. The Engineering\nsegment’s SGA expense of $4.4 million increased by $0.3 million, primarily due to an increased allocation of\ncorporate SGA expenses.\nLife Sciences and Information Technology\nLife Sciences and Information Technology revenue of $10.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023\nincreased by 5.1%. or $0.5 million, as compared to $10.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit\nof $4.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023 increased 25.8%, or $0.8 million, as compared to $3.3\nmillion for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase in gross\nprofit margin. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit margin for the thirteen weeks ended July\n1, 2023 was 39.4% as compared to 33.0% for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes the gross\nprofit margin increase to a concerted effort to increase gross profit margin through its managed service offerings and\nhigher revenue from its RPO offering. The Life Sciences and Information Technology segment experienced\noperating income of $1.8 million as compared to $1.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in\noperating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset by an increase to SGA expense. SGA\nexpense increased to $2.3 million as compared to $2.0 million in the comparable prior-year period. The increase in\nSGA expense was primarily due the acquisition of TalentHerder in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\n35\nITEM 2.

The\nfiscal quarters ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 consisted of twenty-six weeks each.\nRevenue. Revenue decreased 14.2%, or $22.2 million, for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 as compared to\nthe twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 (the “comparable prior-year period”). Revenue decreased $21.0 million in\nthe Specialty Health Care segment, decreased $1.3 million in the Engineering segment and increased $0.1 million in\nthe Life Sciences and Information Technology segment. See more detailed disclosure by segment in our Segment\nDiscussion.\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services decreased 13.3%, or $14.8 million, for the twenty-six weeks\nended July 1, 2023 as compared to the comparable prior-year period. Cost of services decreased primarily due to the\ndecrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and\nJuly 2, 2022 was 71.8% and 71.1%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further information regarding\nchanges in cost of services and gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses were $26.1 million\nfor the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 as compared to $27.4 million for the comparable prior-year period. As\na percentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 19.4% for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and 17.7% for the\ncomparable prior-year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\n36\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nTwenty-Six Weeks Ended July 1, 2023 Compared to Twenty-Six Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 (Continued)\nGain on Sale of Assets. On July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its\nPickering and Kincardine offices, located in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often referred to as Canada\nPower Systems and principally provided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The\ntwo Canada Power Systems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company’s Engineering segment. During\nthe twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023, the Company recorded a discrete gain on the sale of these assets and\nliabilities of $0.4 million due to the final collection of escrow funds from the transaction.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on\nthe Company’s line of credit, net of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other\nexpense, net increased by $0.8 million as compared to the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase\nin interest expense, net. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowing. Borrowings increased primarily to\nfund treasury stock purchases.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company recognized $2.8 million of income tax expense for the twenty-six weeks\nended July 1, 2023, as compared to $4.7 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective\nincome tax rate for the current period was 26.4% as compared to 27.1% for the comparable prior-year period. The\nprojected fiscal 2023 income tax rates as of July 1, 2023, were approximately 26.8%, 25.9% and 11.7% in the\nUnited States, Canada, and Europe, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can\nmaterially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and\nEuropean pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The effective income tax rate can also be impacted by discrete\npermanent differences affecting any period presented.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the\neffect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company.\nThe actual 2023 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in\nvarious jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-\nbased awards.\n37\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nTwenty-Six Weeks Ended July 1, 2023 Compared to Twenty-Six Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $74.7 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 decreased 21.9%, or\n$21.0 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue was driven by both the\nCompany’s school and non-school clients. Revenue from school clients for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023\nwas $55.8 million as compared to $73.8 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from non-school\nclients for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 was $18.9 million as compared to $21.8 million for the\ncomparable prior-year period. Revenue decreases were primarily due to decreased demand associated with COVID-\n19 transitioning from a high level of activity relating during the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 to a lesser\nlevel activity associated with the change of COVID-19 to an endemic during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1,\n2023. The Specialty Health Care segment’s gross profit decreased by 23.0%, or $6.4 million, to $21.5 million for the\ntwenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023, as compared to $27.9 million for the prior-year period. The decrease in gross\nprofit was primarily driven by the decrease in revenue. Gross profit margin for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1,\n2023 decreased to 28.8% as compared to 29.2% for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit\nmargin was primarily due to a mix shift for certain lower margin services. Specialty Health Care experienced\noperating income of $8.0 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023, as compared to $12.5 million for the\ncomparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the decrease in operating income was the decrease in gross\nprofit, offset by a decrease in SGA expense. SGA expense decreased by $1.9 million to $13.2 million, as compared\nto $15.1 million in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a decrease\nin expenses associated with lower revenue and a lower allocation of corporate SGA expenses.\nThe Company believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic helped to increase Specialty Health Care revenue\nand gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the first half of fiscal 2022. The Company also believes the\nCOVID-19 pandemic began to shift to an endemic in the second half of fiscal 2022. As a result, COVID-19-related\nrevenue has decreased. However, the Company also believes that the demand for its Healthcare services is greater\nthan it had been before the COVID-19 pandemic. While the overall impact of these offsetting dynamics is uncertain,\nthe Company believes that, except for seasonality, it is well positioned for growth in revenue going forward.\n38\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nTwenty-Six Weeks Ended July 1, 2023 Compared to Twenty-Six Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nEngineering\nEngineering revenue of $39.5 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 decreased 3.2%, or $1.3 million,\ncompared to the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue was comprised of the following: decreases\nin Aerospace revenue of $1.6 million and Industrial Processing revenue of $2.3 million, offset by an increase to\nEnergy Services revenue of $2.6 million. The decrease in Aerospace revenue was primarily due to a contract\nreduction for the Company’s major outsourcing client. The Company believes the decrease in Industrial Processing\nrevenue was primarily due to the irregular timing of large contracts with its Industrial Processing clients. Gross\nprofit decreased by 17.5%, or $1.9 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit decreased\nbecause of the decrease in revenue and a decrease in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin of 22.5% for the\ncurrent period decreased from 26.3% for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was\nprimarily due to lower utilization resulting from an increase in staff associated with lower revenue as the Company\nabsorbed fixed salaried costs over lower revenue. The Engineering segment experienced operating income of $0.7\nmillion for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023, as compared to $2.3 million for the comparable prior-year\nperiod. The decrease in operating income was due to the decrease in gross profit and an increase to SGA expense,\noffset by a discrete gain in the current period. The Engineering segment’s SGA expense of $8.3 million increased by\n$0.1 million, primarily due to an increased allocation of corporate SGA expenses. The discrete gain on sale of assets\nwas due to the final collection of escrow funds associated with the sale of the Canadian Power Systems in fiscal\n2021.\nLife Sciences and Information Technology\nLife Sciences and Information Technology revenue of $20.0 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023\nincreased by 0.7%, or $0.1 million, as compared to $19.9 million for the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit\nof $7.4 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 increased 14.9%, or $1.0 million, as compared to $6.4\nmillion for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase in gross\nprofit margin. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit margin for the twenty-six weeks ended\nJuly 1, 2023 was 37.2% as compared to 32.6% for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes the\ngross profit margin increase to a concerted effort to increase gross profit margin through its managed service\nofferings and higher revenue from its RPO offering. The Life Sciences and Information Technology segment\nexperienced operating income of $2.7 million as compared to $2.4 million for the comparable prior-year period.\nThe increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset by an increase to SGA\nexpense. SGA expense increased to $4.6 million as compared to $4.0 million in the comparable prior-year period.\nThe increase in SGA expense was primarily due to the acquisition of TalentHerder in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2022 and a higher allocation of corporate SGA expenses.\n39\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the major captions from the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows (in thousands):\nTwenty-Six Weeks Ended\nJuly 1, July 2,\n2023 2022\nCash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $16,511 $20,755\nInvesting activities ($559 ) ($453 )\nFinancing activities ($15,215 ) ($17,175 )\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided $16.5 million of cash for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 as compared to\nproviding $20.8 million in the comparable prior-year period. The major components of cash provided by operating\nactivities in the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and the comparable prior-year period are as follows: net\nincome, and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable,\nprepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs,\nand deferred revenue.\nFor the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023, the Company experienced net income of $7.8 million as compared to\n$12.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. An increase in accounts receivables in the twenty-six weeks\nended July 1, 2023 used $10.9 million of cash as compared to providing $3.6 million in the comparable prior-year\nperiod. The Company primarily attributes this increase in accounts receivables for the twenty-six weeks ended July\n1, 2023 to normal fluctuations in accounts receivable relative to revenue.\nWhile highly variable, the Company’s transit accounts payable typically exceeds the Company’s transit accounts\nreceivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course\nof business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable of $27.3 million\nas of July 1, 2023 and a net payable of $6.5 million as of December 31, 2022, providing $20.8 million of cash during\nthe twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a\nnet payable of $0.9 million as of July 2, 2022 and a net payable of $1.1 million as of January 1, 2022, using $0.2\nmillion of cash during the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022. The increase to net transit payable as of July 1,\n2023 was due to several large, multiyear EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) projects starting in the\nCompany’s second fiscal quarter. In a typical EPC contract, the Company receives significant cash upfront to fund\nequipment procurement and construction subcontractors throughout the project.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets provided cash of $0.3 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023\nas compared to providing $0.4 million of cash for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes\nchanges to prepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of\nbusiness. Since certain expenses are paid before a fiscal year concludes and are amortized over the next fiscal year,\nprepaid expenses and other current assets generally tend to increase at the end of a fiscal year and decrease during\nthe first three quarters of the following fiscal year.\n40\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nOperating Activities (Continued)\nA decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used cash of $1.0 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July\n1, 2023 as compared to using $0.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes these\nchanges to typical fluctuations in the normal course of business.\nChanges in accrued payroll and related costs used cash of $1.2 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023\nas compared to providing $3.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. There are four primary factors that\ngenerally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll\nand related costs is the Company’s largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other\nfactors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two\nweeks and normally has twenty-six weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major\npayroll on the last business day of every other quarter; 3) the timing of various payroll related payments varies in the\nnormal course of business; and 4) most of the Company’s senior management participate in annual incentive plans\nand while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent\nthey are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive\nplan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The\nCompany’s last major payroll for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 was paid on June 30, 2023. During fiscal\n2020, the Company deferred $3.3 million of employer payroll taxes under the CARES Act. Half of these deferred\npayroll taxes were paid in fiscal December 2021 and the remaining portion was paid in fiscal December 2022.\nHistorically, the Company has experienced small deferred revenue balances. In fiscal 2022, the Company’s\nIndustrial Processing group secured several contracts with front-loaded payments, thereby generating larger deferred\nrevenue balances than typically generated. As a result, the Company’s deferred revenue balance as of July 1, 2023\nwas $0.5 million, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2022, using cash from operations of $0.6 million for\nthe twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023. While the Company expects to receive future upfront payments from its\nIndustrial Processing clients, the Company cannot reasonably forecast deferred revenue balances as the timing of\ncontract wins and front-loaded payments are typically haphazard.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $0.6 million for the purchase of property and equipment in the current period as compared\nto using $0.5 million in the comparable prior-year period.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities used $15.2 million of cash for the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 as compared to using\n$17.2 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Company made net borrowings under its line of credit of\n$6.1 million during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 as compared to making net payments of $14.2 million\nin the comparable prior-year period. The Company used $21.1 million to repurchase shares of its common stock in\nthe current period as compared to $2.8 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Company generated cash of\n$0.3 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and $0.1 million for the comparable\nprior-year period.\n41\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n(which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable margin,\ntypically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day\nincrements or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays\nunused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are\nrecorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the\ntwenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 were 6.3% and 1.9%, respectively.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various\nfinancial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order to\npay dividends. As of July 1, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving\nCredit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the\nforeseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $14.9 million and $8.8 million,\nrespectively. There were letters of credit outstanding at July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022 for $2.0 million and\n$1.9 million, respectively. At July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had availability for additional\nborrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $28.1 million and $34.3 million, respectively.\nIn addition to borrowings and sales of shares from its equity plans, the Company may raise capital through sales of\nshares of common stock under its at the market issuance program (the “ATM Program”) established under its May\n2021 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., as the agent (the “Agent”). The ATM\nProgram allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to\n$25.0 million from time to time through the Agent. To date, the Company has not sold any shares under the ATM\nProgram.\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations,\nand meet the other general cash needs of our business. Our liquidity is impacted by general economic, financial,\ncompetitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to\npay our expenses, principally labor-costs, and other related expenditures. We generally satisfy our liquidity needs\nthrough cash provided by operations and, when necessary, our revolving line of credit from Citizens Bank. The\nCompany believes it has a great deal of flexibility to reduce its costs if it becomes necessary. The Company believes\nthat it can satisfy its liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.\n42\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility (Continued)\nThe Company’s liquidity and capital resources as of July 1, 2023, included accounts receivable and total current\nasset balances of $61.6 million and $77.1 million, respectively. Current liabilities were $64.6 million as of July 1,\n2023 and were exceeded by total current assets by $12.5 million.\nThe Company experiences volatility in its daily cash flow and, at times, relies on the revolving line of credit to\nprovide daily liquidity for the Company’s financial operations. As of July 1, 2023, the Company was in compliance\nwith all financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain\ncompliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes.\nFunding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from\none or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or\nfuture financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time\nin the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final\noutcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the\nresults of operations.\nThe Company’s business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through\nstrategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates.\nThe Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally\nincluded significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase\nhowever, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such\nopportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No\nassurance can be given as to the Company’s future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such\nopportunities will be financed.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of July 1, 2023, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss has\nnot been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could result in\nan unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company believes that such\nmatters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of July 1, 2023, the Company has accrued $2.8 million\nfor asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the\nCompany is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not determined if it\nhas any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually limited to an amount\nno higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found liable, any damages would be\ncovered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum coverage of $5.0 million. While the\nCompany attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has reserved $0.5 million for this project.\nThe Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3 million or that liability over $0.5 million, if\nany, will be covered by insurance.\n43\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCommitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the\nordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\nThe Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in\n1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company is currently\nimplementing an upgrade of its current system and expects to go live in 2024. The Company estimates this upgrade\nor replacement of its financial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\nThese estimates are subject to material change.\nThe Company’s current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes\nthat its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of\nbusiness for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates\nthrough November 2027. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nOperating Finance\nFiscal Year Leases Leases\n2023 (After July 1, 2023) $716 $233\n2024 754 233\n2025 493 -\n2026 409 -\n2027 302 -\nThereafter 1,456 -\nTotal lease payments $4,130 $466\nLess: imputed interest (531 ) (2 )\nTotal $3,599 $464\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of July 1, 2023, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent consideration\nmay be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets of Thermal\nKinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, “TKE”), and 2) effective October 2,\n2022, the Company acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates future contingent\npayments at July 1, 2023 as follows:\nTotal\nThe four quarters following July 1, 2023 $300\nThereafter 1,671\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $1,971\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of July 1, 2023. Contingent consideration\nrelated to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other (expense)\nincome, net.\n44\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment\nportfolio and debt instruments, which primarily consist of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company does not\nhave any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio. The Company places its investments in instruments that\nmeet high credit quality standards. The Company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation\nof its invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. As of July 1, 2023, the Company’s\ninvestments consisted of cash and money market funds. The Company does not use interest rate derivative\ninstruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the Company’s variable-rate line of credit\nbalances during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023, if the interest rate on the Company’s variable-rate line of\ncredit (using an incremental borrowing rate) during the period had been 1.0% higher, the Company’s interest\nexpense on an annualized basis would have increased by $0.2 million. The Company does not expect any material\nloss with respect to its investment portfolio.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Principal\nExecutive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period\ncovered by this report. As previously disclosed under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures” in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we identified deficiencies described below that existed as\nof December 31, 2022, and continued to exist at July 1, 2023. Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive\nOfficer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as\nsuch term is defined in Rule(s) 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of July 1,\n2023, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements\nwill not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement identified the following control deficiencies that resulted in material weaknesses in our internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The Company did not design and maintain information\ntechnology controls relevant to preparing its financial statements, specifically concerning (i) separation of duties to\nthe SAP ERP and General Ledger, (ii) adequate restriction of administrator-type access to SAP, (iii) program change\nmanagement controls, and (iv) user access controls that ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately\nrestrict user access to financial applications, programs, and data. As a result, the Company's related process-level IT-\ndependent manual and automated controls that rely upon the affected ITGCs, or information coming from IT\nsystems with affected ITGCs, were also deemed ineffective.\nThis material weakness did not result in a misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements.\n45\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (CONTINUED)\nPlanned Material Weakness Remediation Activities\nTo address these material weaknesses, we have commenced actions to formalize the Company's framework and\npolicies to maintain evidence in the operation of control procedures and improve our IT general controls. Our\nplanned remediation efforts related to the above-identified material weaknesses include, but are not limited to:\n Investments to upgrade or replace existing systems that do not have the appropriate infrastructure to meet\nthe requirements of our internal control framework.\n Expand the available resources at the Company with experience designing and implementing control\nactivities, including information technology general controls, with the advice from third-party consultants\nand specialists.\n Assess segregation of duties and implement an annual user access review, including role design and\nprocess transformation to appropriately mitigate significant risks associated with conflicting responsibilities\nin financial systems.\n Design and implement IT controls in change management that will ensure all changes are tested in staging,\napproved, and documented, and ensure that developers cannot deploy their own code to production.\n Perform additional training to ensure a clear understanding of risk assessment, controls, and monitoring\nactivities related to automated processes, systems, and ITGCs related to financial reporting.\nWe will continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and take steps to\nremediate the known material weaknesses expeditiously. The implementation of these remediation efforts is in\nprogress, may require additional expenditures to implement, and will require validation and testing of the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles, and as a result, the\ntiming of when we will be able to remediate the material weaknesses fully is uncertain. We may also conclude that\nadditional measures may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting, which may necessitate further implementation and evaluation time.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the material weaknesses and remediation efforts described above, there have been no changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that\noccurred during the twenty-six weeks ended July 1, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The company is making ongoing progress on its\nremediation plan to address the material weakness previously disclosed. A final assessment of remediation efforts\nwill be conducted as part of our annual review of internal controls over financial reporting.\n46\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements of RCM Technologies, Inc. and\nsubsidiaries (“RCM” or the “Company”) are unaudited. The year-end consolidated balance sheet was derived\nfrom the Company’s audited statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States. These statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission pertaining to reports on Form 10-Q and should be read\nin conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report Form 10-K for such period. Certain information\nand footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all\nadjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows for such interim periods.\nResults for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 are not\nnecessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year or any future period.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31.\nBoth the current fiscal year ending December 30, 2023 (fiscal 2023) and the prior fiscal year ended December\n31, 2022 (fiscal 2022) are 52-week reporting years. The fiscal quarters for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 align as\nfollows:\nFiscal 2023 Quarters Weeks Fiscal 2022 Quarters Weeks\nApril 1, 2023 Thirteen April 2, 2022 Thirteen\nJuly 1, 2023 Thirteen July 2, 2022 Thirteen\nSeptember 30, 2023 Thirteen October 1, 2022 Thirteen\nDecember 30, 2023 Thirteen December 31, 2022 Thirteen\n10\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n2. Use of Estimates and Uncertainties\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe Company uses estimates to determine an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable,\nlitigation, medical claims, vacation, goodwill impairment, if any, equity compensation, the tax rate applied and\nthe valuation of certain assets and liability accounts. In addition, the Company reviews its estimated costs to\ncomplete a contract and adjusts those costs when necessary. These estimates can be significant to the operating\nresults and financial position of the Company. The estimates are based upon various factors including current\nand historical trends, as well as other pertinent industry and regulatory authority information. Management\nregularly evaluates this information to determine if it is necessary to update the basis for its estimates and to\nadjust for known changes.\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care\ninsurance. The amounts included in the Company’s costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can\nvary based on changes in assumptions, the Company’s claims experience or the providers included in the\nassociated insurance programs.\nThe Company can be affected by a variety of factors including uncertainty relating to the performance of the\ngeneral economy, competition, demand for the Company’s services, adverse litigation and claims and the\nhiring, training and retention of key employees.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s carrying value of financial instruments, consisting primarily of accounts receivable, transit\naccounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, transit accounts payable and borrowings under\nline of credit approximates fair value due to their liquidity or their short-term nature and the line of credit’s\nvariable interest rate. The Company does not have derivative products in place to manage risks related to\nforeign currency fluctuations for its foreign operations or for interest rate changes.\nThe Company re-measures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period and any\nchange in the fair value from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, is\nrecorded in earnings in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\n11\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring\nservices promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to\nreceive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate\nservice streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the\ncontract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the\ntransaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize\nrevenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company’s Engineering Services, Life Sciences\nand Information Technology segments perform consulting and project solution services. The Healthcare\nsegment specializes in long-term and short-term staffing and placement services to hospitals, schools and long-\nterm care facilities amongst others. All of the Company’s segments perform staff augmentation services and\nderive revenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company’s revenue is invoiced on a time\nand materials basis.\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue source for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks\nended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022:\nThirteen Thirty-Nine\nWeeks Ended Weeks Ended\nSeptember 30, October 1, September 30, October 1,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nSpecialty Health Care:\nTime and Material $24,485 $27,495 $98,595 $122,563\nPermanent Placement Services 410 502 958 1,075\nTotal Specialty Health Care $24,895 $27,997 $99,553 $123,638\nEngineering:\nTime and Material $10,625 $11,774 $32,652 $31,601\nFixed Fee 11,827 9,148 29,304 30,125\nTotal Engineering $22,452 $20,922 $61,956 $61,726\nLife Sciences and Information Technology:\nTime and Material $8,898 $8,249 $25,757 $26,506\nPermanent Placement Services 121 167 368 531\nFixed Fee 1,683 817 4,575 2,058\nTotal Life Sciences and Information Technology $10,702 $9,233 $30,700 $29,095\n$58,049 $58,152 $192,209 $214,459\n12\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition (Continued)\nTime and Material\nThe Company’s Health Care segment predominantly recognizes revenue through time and material work while\nits Engineering and Life Sciences and Information Technology segments recognize revenue through both time\nand material and fixed fee work. The Company’s time and material contracts are typically based on the number\nof hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials\ncontracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed Fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of\nits customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements\nare typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that\nfixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company’s fixed fee\npurchase orders are typically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are\nprovided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain\ninstances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue\nunder these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. From time-to-time,\namounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAdditionally, some contracts contain “Performance Fees” (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget.\nPerformance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified\nmaximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined.\nFor contracts where there is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the revenue is not\nrecognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the\nrelated revenue is recognized.\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are\ntypically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company’s client. The\nCompany guarantees its permanent placements on a prorated basis for 90 days. In the event a candidate is not\nretained for the 90-day period, the Company will provide a suitable replacement candidate. In the event a\nreplacement candidate cannot be located, the Company will provide a prorated refund to the client. An\nallowance for refunds, based upon the Company’s historical experience, is recorded in the financial statements.\nDeferred Revenue\nThere was $0.3 million of deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023. Deferred revenue was $1.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be\nrecognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet, although this is\nan infrequent occurrence. For the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Company\nrecognized revenue of $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the\nbeginning of the reporting period. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022,\nthe Company recognized revenue of $1.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively, that was included in deferred\nrevenue at the beginning of the reporting period.\n13\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition (Continued)\nConcentration\nDuring the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company had one customer exceed 10% of\nconsolidated revenue, representing 16.2% of consolidated revenue. During the thirty-nine weeks ended October\n1, 2022, the Company had two customers exceed 10% of consolidated revenue, representing 16.1% and 12.3%\nof consolidated revenue. In both periods presented, the customers are included in the Company’s Specialty\nHealth Care segment.\n4. Accounts Receivable, Transit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payable\nThe Company’s accounts receivable comprise the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\nBilled $37,632 $40,256\nUnbilled 15,769 6,615\nWork-in-progress 5,158 4,991\nAllowance for sales discounts and doubtful accounts (1,100 ) (1,100 )\nAccounts receivable, net $57,459 $50,762\nUnbilled receivables primarily represent revenue earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the\nbalance sheet ending date. Work-in-progress primarily represents revenue earned under contracts which the\nCompany contractually invoices at future dates.\nFrom time to time, the Company’s Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things,\nconstruction management and engineering services. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may engage\nsubcontractors to provide construction or other services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project\nvalue; and c) assumes no ownership or risks of inventory. In such situations, the Company acts as an agent\nunder the provisions of FASB ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and therefore recognizes\nrevenue on a “net-basis.” The Company records revenue on a “net” basis on relevant engineering and\nconstruction management projects, which require subcontractor/procurement costs or transit costs. In those\nsituations, the Company charges the client a negotiated fee, which is reported as net revenue when earned.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the\ncorresponding payment from the Company’s end-client is received. Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of\nthe subcontractor or staffing agency, the Company records this amount simultaneously as both a “transit\naccount receivable” and “transit account payable,” as the amount when paid to the Company is due to and\ngenerally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The Company typically does not pay a given transit\naccount payable until the related transit account receivable is collected. The Company is typically obligated to\npay the subcontractor or staffing agency whether or not the client pays the Company. The Company’s transit\naccounts payable generally exceeds the Company’s transit accounts receivable but absolute amounts and\nspreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The transit accounts\nreceivable was $9.5 million and related transit accounts payable was $38.4 million, for a net payable of $28.9\nmillion, as of September 30, 2023. The transit accounts receivable was $3.3 million and related transit accounts\npayable was $9.8 million, for a net payable of $6.5 million, as of December 31, 2022.\n14\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and are depreciated\nor amortized on the straight-line method at rates calculated to provide for retirement of assets at the end of their\nestimated useful lives. Computer hardware and software, and furniture and office equipment are typically\ndepreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the\nasset or the lease term.\nProperty and equipment comprise the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\nComputer hardware and software $3,489 $4,077\nFurniture and office equipment 260 220\nLeasehold improvements 413 267\nLaboratory equipment 143 67\n4,305 4,630\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization 2,084 2,532\nProperty and equipment, net $2,221 $2,098\nThe Company periodically writes off fully depreciated and amortized assets. The Company wrote off fully\ndepreciated and amortized assets of $1,201 and $901 during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023\nand October 1, 2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for the\nthirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 was $243 and $266, respectively. Depreciation\nand amortization expense of property and equipment for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and\nOctober 1, 2022 was $756 and $729, respectively.\n6. Acquisitions and Divestitures\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had two acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain\nassets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC, and 2) effective October 2,\n2022, the Company acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates future contingent\npayments at September 30, 2023 as follows:\nTotal\nThe four quarters following September 30, 2023 $300\nThereafter 1,671\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $1,971\n15\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n6. Acquisitions and Divestitures (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments (Continued)\nFor acquisitions that involve contingent consideration, the Company records a liability equal to the fair value of\nthe estimated contingent consideration obligation as of the acquisition date. The Company determines the\nacquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on the likelihood of paying the additional\nconsideration. The fair value is estimated using projected future operating results and the corresponding future\nearn-out payments that can be earned upon the achievement of specified operating objectives and financial\nresults by acquired companies using Level 3 inputs and the amounts are then discounted to present value. These\nliabilities are measured quarterly at fair value, and any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration\nliability is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. During the measurement period, which may\nbe up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\nperiod or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of September 30, 2023. Contingent\nconsideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in\nother (expense) income, net.\nPotential future contingent payments for acquisitions after September 30, 2023 are capped at a cumulative\nmaximum of $11.6 million. The Company paid $0.3 million and $0.1 million of contingent consideration during\nthe thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. The contingent\nconsideration paid in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 included $0.1 million of the Company's\ncommon stock.\n7. Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in\nbusiness combinations. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the\nCompany's fiscal year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value\nof goodwill may be below the carrying amount. The Company reviewed industry and market conditions,\nreporting unit specific events as well as overall financial performance and determined that no indicators of\nimpairment of goodwill existed during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. As such, no\nimpairment loss on the Company’s intangible assets during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023\nwas recorded as a result of such review.\nThe carrying amount of goodwill as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was as follows:\nSpecialty Information\nEngineering Health Care Technology Total\n$11,918 $2,398 $7,831 $22,147\n16\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n8. Line of Credit\nOn April 24, 2023, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the “Fourth\nAmended and Restated Loan Agreement”) with Citizens Bank, N.A., as lender (in such capacity, the “Lender”)\nand as administrative agent and arranger (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), to amend and restate in\nits entirety that certain Third Amended and Restated Agreement dated as of the August 9, 2018 (as the same has\nbeen amended and modified prior to the date hereof, the “Existing Loan Agreement”).\nThe Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for a $45.0 million revolving credit facility (the\n“Revolving Credit Facility”), has no sub-limit for letters of credit, and expires on April 24, 2026.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n(which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable\nmargin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-\nday increments or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company\nalso pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line\nfees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees,\nfor the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 were 6.4% and 2.7%, respectively.\nAll borrowings under the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement remain collateralized with\nsubstantially all of the Company’s assets, as well as the capital stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit\nFacility also contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the\nCompany’s ability to borrow in order to pay dividends. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in\ncompliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will\nmaintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $6.7 million and\n$8.8 million, respectively. There were letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022 for $2.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nCompany had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $36.3 million and\n$34.3 million, respectively.\n9. Per Share Data\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares outstanding used for\ndiluted earnings per share. The number of weighted-average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings\nper share for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 was determined\nas follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nSeptember 30, October 1, September 30, October 1,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 7,919,752 10,154,505 8,469,501 10,172,765\nDilutive effect of outstanding restricted share awards 276,578 367,653 261,497 394,051\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 8,196,330 10,522,158 8,730,998 10,566,816\nFor all periods presented, there were no anti-dilutive shares included in the calculation of common stock\nequivalents as there were no stock options outstanding.\n17\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Per Share Data (Continued)\nUnissued shares of common stock were reserved for the following purposes:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\nTime-based restricted stock awards outstanding 383,961 274,939\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards outstanding 100,000 -\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards outstanding\nunder plans to be approved by the shareholders - 225,000\nFuture grants of options or shares 608,129 890,682\nShares reserved for employee stock purchase plan 297,730 364,231\nTotal 1,389,820 1,754,852\n10. Share-Based Compensation\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had two share-based employee compensation plans, the Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan and the 2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.\nThe Company measures the fair value of share-based awards, if and when granted, based on the Black-Scholes\nmethod and using the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Awards\ntypically vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within 10 years of issuance. The Company\nmay also issue immediately vested equity awards. Share-based compensation expense related to time-based\nawards is amortized in accordance with applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. The\nCompany expenses performance-based awards only when the performance metrics are likely to be achieved and\nthe associated awards are therefore likely to vest. Performance-based share awards that are likely to vest are\nalso expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period but may vest on a retroactive basis or be reversed,\ndepending on when it is determined that they are likely to vest, or in the case of a reversal when they are later\ndetermined to be unlikely to vest or forfeited.\nShare-based compensation expense for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 was\n$483 and $425, respectively. Share-based compensation expense for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30,\n2023 and October 1, 2022 was $1,450 and $1,130, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is included\nin selling, general and administrative expense in the Company’s statement of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had $3.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, with\napproximately $3.2 million related to time-based non-vested share-based awards outstanding and $0.2 million\nrelated to performance-based non-vested share-based awards outstanding. The Company expects to recognize\nthe expense associated with time-based non-vested share-based awards through fiscal 2027. If earned, the\nCompany will recognize the expense associated with performance-based non-vested share-based awards\nstraight-line through fiscal 2023. These amounts do not include a) the cost of any additional share-based\nawards granted in future periods or b) the impact of any potential changes in the Company’s forfeiture rate.\n18\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\nIncentive Share-Based Plans\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company implemented the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) with shareholder\napproval, effective January 1, 2001. Under the Purchase Plan, employees meeting certain specific employment\nqualifications are eligible to participate and can purchase shares of common stock semi-annually through\npayroll deductions at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the commencement or end of the\noffering period. The purchase plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock through\npayroll deductions for up to 10% of qualified compensation, subject to maximum purchases in any one fiscal\nyear of 3,000 shares.\nIn fiscal 2015, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,100,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Purchase Plan to December 31, 2025. In fiscal 2018,\nthe Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares\nof stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000 shares so that the\ntotal number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be 1,400,000 shares. In\nfiscal 2021, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 400,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,800,000 shares and the termination date of the Purchase Plan was extended to December 31, 2030.\nThe Company has two offering periods in the Purchase Plan coinciding with the Company’s first two fiscal\nquarters and the last two fiscal quarters. Actual shares are issued on the first business day of the subsequent\noffering period for the prior offering period payroll deductions. The number of shares issued on July 3, 2023\n(the first business day following the previous offering period) was 33,430. As of September 30, 2023, there\nwere 297,730 shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Compensation expense, representing the\ndiscount to the quoted market price, for the Purchase Plan for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023\nand October 1, 2022 was $244 and $180, respectively.\n19\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\n2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan)\nThe 2014 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in December 2014, initially provided for the issuance\nof up to 625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to officers, non-employee directors, employees of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries, or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company. In fiscal 2016, fiscal 2020\nand fiscal 2022, the Company amended, or amended and restated, the 2014 Plan with shareholder approval to\nincrease the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the Plan by an additional 500,000,\n850,000 and 1,000,000 shares, respectively, so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance\nunder the Plan is 2,975,000 shares. The expiration date of the Plan is December 17, 2030, unless the 2014 Plan\nis terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with the approval of the stockholders. The\nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the vesting period at the time of grant.\nAll stock awards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the\nCompany during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period assuming the grantee’s\nstock award fully vests. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30,\n2023, there were no accrued dividends. Dividends for stock awards that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nAs of September 30, 2023, under the 2014 Plan, 383,961 time-based shares were outstanding, 100,000\nperformance-based restricted stock awards were outstanding and 608,129 shares were available for awards.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Awards\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues time-based restricted stock awards. The following summarizes the\nactivity in the time-based restricted stock awards under the 2014 Plan during the thirty-nine weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023:\nNumber of Weighted\nTime-Based Average\nRestricted Grant Date Fair\nStock Awards Value per Share\nOutstanding non-vested at December 31, 2022 274,939 $3.59\nGranted 288,893 $13.00\nVested (168,769 ) $2.11\nForfeited or expired (11,102 ) $2.23\nOutstanding non-vested at September 30, 2023 383,961 $11.36\nBased on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $19.54 per share on September 29, 2023 (the\nlast trading day prior to September 30, 2023), the intrinsic value of the time-based non-vested restricted stock\nawards at September 30, 2023 was approximately $4.7 million. As of September 30, 2023, there was\napproximately $3.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to time-based restricted stock\nawards, which is expected to be recognized over the average weighted remaining vesting period of the restricted\nstock awards through fiscal 2027.\n20\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Awards\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock awards to its executives.\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics\nas determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee.\nThe following summarizes the activity in the performance-based restricted stock awards during the thirty-nine\nweeks ended September 30, 2023:\nNumber of\nPerformance- Weighted\nBased Average\nRestricted Grant Date Fair\nStock Awards Value per Share\nOutstanding non-vested at December 31, 2022 225,000 $8.73\nGranted - -\nVested (125,000 ) $6.15\nForfeited or expired - -\nOutstanding non-vested at September 30, 2023 100,000 $11.96\nAs of September 30, 2023, there was one outstanding grant for performance-based restricted stock awards\nissued to Bradley Vizi, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. In December 2022, the Company issued a\nperformance-based restricted stock unit grant of 100,000 shares, subject to increase up to 125,000 shares, based\non fiscal 2023 performance (the “2023 Grant”). The Company has not made a determination as to how many\nshares it expects to issue under the 2023 Grant.\nThe Company assesses at each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable\nand recognizes the expense when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company\nwill then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and\nrecognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later\nmeasurement date, the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock awards deemed as likely to\nvest are deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed.\nShare-based compensation for performance-based equity agreement was $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the\nthirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. Share-based compensation for\nperformance-based equity agreement was $0.4 million and $0.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively\nDuring the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company awarded 4,762 immediately vested share\nawards at an average price of $10.50. During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2022, the Company\nawarded 1,000 immediately vested share awards at an average price of $18.48.\n21\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n11. Treasury Stock Transactions\nOn April 25, 2023, the Board authorized a program to repurchase shares of its common stock up to an amount\nnot to exceed $25.0 million. This newly approved program succeeds the Company’s prior repurchase program\nauthorized in November 2021, which was substantially completed in April 2023. The program is designed to\nprovide the Company with enhanced flexibility over the long term to optimize its capital structure. Shares of\nthe Common Stock may be repurchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions. The program\nmay be terminated or suspended at any time at the discretion of the Company. The Company may enter into a\nRule 10b5-1 trading plan to effect a portion of the authorized purchases if the criteria set forth in the plan are\nmet. Such a plan would enable the Company to repurchase its shares during periods outside of its normal\ntrading windows when the Company typically would not be active in the market.\nOn April 24, 2023, the Company agreed to repurchase, in a private transaction approved by the Board, 333,686\nshares of common stock at a per-share price of $11.91 per share.\nDuring the thirty-nine weeks ending September 30, 2023, the Company purchased 1,758,160 shares at an\naverage price of $13.80 per share, including the aforementioned private transaction. During the thirty-nine\nweeks ended October 1, 2022, the Company purchased 637,372 shares at an average price of $10.03 per share.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had $14.3 million available for future treasury stock purchases.\nThe Company accrued $0.2 million in excise tax associated with its Treasury Stock Repurchase Plan during the\nthirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023.\n12. New Accounting Standards and Updates\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\n2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting\ncredit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the\nFASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) -\nAmendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC\nSection on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which\namends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its\namendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022. CECL estimates of expected credit losses on trade receivables over their life will be\nrequired to be recorded at inception, based on historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The Company adopted the standard in its first quarter of 2023. There was no material\nimpact on the results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This standard only applies to contracts and other\ntransactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be\ndiscontinued due to reference rate reform. This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and\nexceptions to accounting guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease entities’ financial\nreporting burdens as the market transitions from the LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative\nreference rates. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the sunset date of Topic\n848. This update defers the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may\nelect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n22\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Segment Information (Continued)\nThe Company derives a majority of its revenue from offices in the United States. Revenues reported for each\noperating segment are all from external customers. The Company is domiciled in the United States and its\nsegments operate in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Europe. Revenue by geographic area for the\nthirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 was as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nSeptember 30, October 1, September 30, October 1,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nRevenue\nUnited States $53,679 $55,180 $179,800 $205,162\nCanada 1,647 1,091 5,060 3,555\nPuerto Rico 1,643 1,261 4,745 3,760\nEurope 1,080 620 2,604 1,982\n$58,049 $58,152 $192,209 $214,459\nTotal assets by geographic area as of the reported periods were as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\nTotal assets\nUnited States $91,141 $81,558\nCanada 1,829 1,640\nPuerto Rico 4,157 1,401\nEurope 4,087 3,365\n$101,214 $87,964\n14. Income Taxes\nThe Company recognized $3.2 million of income tax expense for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30,\n2023, as compared to $6.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective income tax\nrate for the current period was 21.9% as compared to 27.1% for the comparable prior-year period. The effective\nfiscal 2023 income tax rates as of September 30, 2023, were approximately 21.5%, 26.1% and 13.3% in the\nUnited States, Canada and Europe, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can\nmaterially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and\nEuropean pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The comparable prior-year period estimated income tax\nrates were 27.5%, 25.1% and 15.7% in the United States, Canada and Europe, respectively. The primary reason\nfor the decrease in the consolidated effective rate in the current period was due to a permanent tax difference\nassociated with the tax deduction for equity grants in the United States that vested during the thirteen weeks\nended September 30, 2023.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily\nfrom the effect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to\nthe Company. The actual 2023 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating\nincome earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options\nand vesting of share-based awards.\n25\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is a defendant in various legal actions that arise in the ordinary business\ncourse. These matters may relate to professional liability, tax, compensation, contract, competitor disputes, and\nemployee-related matters and include individual and class action lawsuits, as well as inquiries and\ninvestigations by governmental agencies regarding the Company’s employment and compensation practices.\nAdditionally, some of the Company’s clients may also become subject to claims, governmental inquiries and\ninvestigations, and legal actions relating to the Company’s professional services. Depending upon the particular\nfacts and circumstances, the Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations under its contracts\nwith such clients relating to these matters.\nAs such, the Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as\npotential ranges of losses and possible recoveries. The Company may not be covered by insurance as it pertains\nto some or all of these matters. A determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments\nand contingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each matter.\nThe Company records a liability when management believes an adverse outcome from a loss contingency is\nboth probable and the amount, or a range, can be reasonably estimated. From time to time, the Company must\nestimate the potential loss even though the party adverse to the Company has not asserted any specific amounts.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount. The\nCompany reviews its loss contingencies at least quarterly and it adjusts its accruals and/or disclosures to reflect\nthe impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, or other new information, as deemed\nnecessary. Once established, a provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in\ncircumstances. The Company could increase or decrease its earnings in the period that the changes are made.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of September 30, 2023, where the Company believes it\nhas a probability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of\nloss has not been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims\ncould result in an unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company\nbelieves that such matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of September 30, 2023, the\nCompany has accrued $2.8 million for asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by\nthe Company is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not\ndetermined if it has any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually\nlimited to an amount no higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found\nliable, any damages would be covered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum\ncoverage of $5.0 million. While the Company attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has\nreserved $0.5 million for this project. The Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3\nmillion or that liability over $0.5 million, if any, will be covered by insurance.\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the\nordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\n26\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n16. Leases\nLeases are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 842, Leases which requires lessees to recognize a right of\nuse (“ROU”) asset and an operating right of use liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months and\nrequires disclosures by lessees and lessors about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from\nleases.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases where the Company is the lessee,\nright of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets and lease\nliabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the\nlease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining\nthe present value of lease payments. The right of use asset also consists of any lease incentives received. The\nlease terms used to calculate the right of use asset and related lease liability include options to extend or\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for\noperating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense while the\nexpense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation expense and interest expense using the accelerated\ninterest method of recognition. The Company has lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-\nlease components. The Company has elected to account for these as a single lease component with the\nexception of its real estate leases.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nSeptember 30, October 1, September 30, October 1,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nOperating lease cost $349 $341 $1,078 $1,245\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right of use assets $116 $134 $368 $350\nInterest on lease liabilities 1 2 3 6\nTotal finance lease cost $117 $136 $371 $356\nSupplemental Cash Flow information related to leases was as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nSeptember 30, October 1, September 30, October 1,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement\nof lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $359 $357 $1,102 $1,272\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $1 $ - $4 $6\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases $115 $117 $346 $388\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for lease\nobligations\nOperating leases $364 $364 $ - $1,096\nFinance leases $257 $257 $ - $257\n27\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview\nRCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the impact of\neconomic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company’s\nfinancial performance.\nThe Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven\nrecord of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to\noptimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong\nvertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.\nThe Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business\nprocesses to compete in today’s business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing\nbusiness and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses\ntoday are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact\non spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.\nNonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced life sciences,\ninformation technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they\ncan maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage.\nAlthough working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support\nincreasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a\ndemand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate\nthe potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.\nThe Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon\nfixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management\nand solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally\nendeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also\nrealizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical\nconsultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily\nprovided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company’s consultants based upon their\nskill level, experience and the type of work performed.\nThe majority of the Company’s services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the\nmore complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the\nnature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more\ncomplex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally\nterminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days’ notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically, these contracts are for less than one year. The\nCompany recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.\n30\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview (Continued)\nCosts of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and\nemployees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses\nconsist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating\nactivities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries\nand benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company’s corporate marketing,\nadministrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these\nexpenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the\npurpose of segment financial reporting.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our consolidated financial statements,\nestimates are used for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-\nlived intangible assets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock awards, insurance liabilities, accounting for\nincome taxes and accrued bonuses.\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, Note\n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2022. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies require significant, difficult or\ncomplex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. Such policies are summarized in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of the recently issued accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 12, New Accounting Standards\nand Updates from the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.\n31\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nForward-looking Information\nThe Company’s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending\nprograms, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering, life sciences\nand information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company’s\noperating performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, global events such as the recent COVID-19\npandemic and endemic also have a substantial impact on our operations and financial results. The Company\nbelieves that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings\nprovides some insulation from adverse trends. However, general economic declines could result in the need for\nfuture cost reductions or changes in strategy.\nAdditionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of\nemployment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with\nrespect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. There can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a\nsufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.\nThe consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company\ncompetes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company’s service\nlines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors\nand customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future,\nwhich could limit the Company’s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.\n32\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended October 1, 2022\nA summary of operating results for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 is as follows\n(in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2023 October 1, 2022\n% of % of\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue\nRevenue $58,049 100.0 $58,152 100.0\nCost of services 40,768 70.2 40,794 70.1\nGross profit 17,281 29.8 17,358 29.9\nSelling, general and administrative 12,662 21.8 12,551 21.6\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment 243 0.4 266 0.4\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 45 0.1 - 0.0\nGain on sale of assets - - (219 ) (0.4 )\nOperating costs and expenses 12,950 22.3 12,598 21.6\nOperating income 4,331 7.5 4,760 8.3\nOther expense (income), net 141 0.2 (55 ) 0.0\nIncome before income taxes 4,190 7.3 4,815 8.3\nIncome tax expense 434 0.8 1,297 2.2\nNet income $3,756 6.5 $3,518 6.1\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. The\nfiscal quarters ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 consisted of thirteen weeks each.\nRevenue. Revenue decreased by $0.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the\nthirteen weeks ended October 1, 2022 (the “comparable prior-year period”). Revenue decreased $3.1 million in the\nSpecialty Health Care segment, increased $1.5 million in the Engineering segment and increased $1.5 million in the\nLife Sciences and Information Technology segment. See more detailed disclosure by segment in our Segment\nDiscussion.\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services decreased by a negligible amount for the thirteen weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 as compared to the comparable prior-year period. Cost of services decreased primarily due to\nthe decrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the thirteen weeks ended September 30,\n2023 and October 1, 2022 was 70.2% and 70.1%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further information\nregarding changes in cost of services and gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses were $12.7 million\nfor the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $12.6 million for the comparable prior-year period.\nAs a percentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 21.8% for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 and 21.6%\nfor the comparable prior-year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\n33\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended October 1, 2022\n(Continued)\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on\nthe Company’s line of credit, net of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other\nexpense, net increased by $0.2 million as compared to the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase\nin interest expense, net. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowing. Borrowings increased primarily to\nfund treasury stock purchases.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company recognized $0.4 million of income tax expense for the thirteen weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, as compared to $1.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective\nincome tax rate for the current period was 10.4% as compared to 26.9% for the comparable prior-year period. The\neffective fiscal 2023 income tax rates as of September 30, 2023, were approximately 7.3%, 26.7% and 15.1% in the\nUnited States, Canada, and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can\nmaterially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and\nSerbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The effective income tax rate can also be impacted by discrete\npermanent differences affecting any period presented. The primary reason for the decrease in the consolidated\neffective rate in the current period was due to a permanent tax difference associated with the tax deduction for equity\ngrants in the United States that vested during the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the\neffect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company.\nThe actual 2023 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in\nvarious jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-\nbased awards.\n34\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended October 1, 2022\n(Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $24.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 decreased 11.1%,\nor $3.1 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue was driven by the\nCompany’s non-school clients, slightly offset by an increase in revenue from the Company’s school clients.\nRevenue from school clients for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 was $17.3 million as compared to\n$16.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from non-school clients for the thirteen weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was $7.6 million as compared to $11.4 million for the comparable prior-year period. The\nrevenue decrease for non-school clients was primarily due to decreased demand associated with COVID-19\ntransitioning from a high level of activity relating to the pandemic during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2022\nto a lesser level activity associated with the change of COVID-19 to an endemic during the thirteen weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Specialty Health Care segment’s gross profit decreased by 17.0%, or $1.5 million, to $7.5\nmillion for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $9.0 million for the prior-year period. The\ndecrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the decrease in revenue and a decrease in gross profit margin. Gross\nprofit margin for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 decreased to 30.0% as compared to 32.1% for the\ncomparable prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to a mix shift to lower margin\nservices. Specialty Health Care experienced operating income of $1.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, as compared to $2.9 million for the comparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the\ndecrease in operating income was the decrease in gross profit.\nThe Company believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic helped to increase Specialty Health Care revenue\nand gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the first half of fiscal 2022. The Company also believes the\nCOVID-19 pandemic began to shift to an endemic in the second half of fiscal 2022. As a result, COVID-19-related\nrevenue has decreased. However, the Company also believes that the demand for its Healthcare services is greater\nthan it typically had been before the COVID-19 pandemic. While the overall impact of these offsetting dynamics is\nuncertain, the Company believes that, except for seasonality, it is well positioned for growth in revenue going\nforward.\n35\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended October 1, 2022\n(Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nEngineering\nEngineering revenue of $22.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, increased 7.3%, or $1.5\nmillion, compared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue comprised the following: an\nincrease in Energy Services revenue of $3.1 million, offset by decreases in Aerospace revenue of $1.4 million and\nIndustrial Processing revenue of $0.2 million. Aerospace revenue decreased primarily due to a contract reduction\nfor the Company’s major outsourcing client. The Company believes the decrease in Industrial Processing revenue\nwas primarily due to the irregular timing of large contracts with its Industrial Processing clients. Gross profit\ndecreased by 5.2%, or $0.3 million, compared to the prior-year period. Gross profit increased because of the\nincrease in revenue, offset by a decrease in gross profit margin. The gross profit margin of 25.0% for the current\nperiod decreased from 25.5% for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was\nprimarily due to lower utilization resulting from an increase in staff in anticipation of higher revenue. The\nEngineering segment experienced operating income of $1.2 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30,\n2023, as compared to $0.9 million for the comparable prior-year period. The operating income increased due to the\nincrease in gross profit and a decrease in SGA expense. The Engineering segment’s SGA expense of $4.3 million\ndecreased from $4.5 million, primarily due to a focus on reducing SGA expenses.\nLife Sciences and Information Technology\nLife Sciences and Information Technology revenue of $10.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30,\n2023 increased by 15.9%. or $1.5 million, as compared to $9.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. Gross\nprofit of $4.2 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 increased 38.4%, or $1.2 million, as\ncompared to $3.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to an\nincrease in gross profit margin. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit margin for the thirteen\nweeks ended September 30, 2023 was 39.4% as compared to 33.0% for the comparable prior-year period. The\nCompany attributes the gross profit margin increase to a concerted effort to increase gross profit margin through its\nmanaged service offerings and higher revenue from its recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) offering. The Life\nSciences and Information Technology segment experienced operating income of $1.8 million as compared to $0.9\nmillion for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in\ngross profit, offset by an increase to SGA expense. SGA expense increased to $2.4 million as compared to $2.1\nmillion in the comparable prior-year period. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due the acquisition of\nTalentHerder in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\n36\nITEM 2.

As a percentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 20.2% for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023\nand 18.6% for the comparable prior-year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense\nchanges.\n37\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 1, 2022\n(Continued)\nGain on Sale of Assets. On July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its\nPickering and Kincardine offices, located in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often referred to as Canada\nPower Systems and principally provided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The\ntwo Canada Power Systems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company’s Engineering segment. During\nthe thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a discrete gain on the sale of these assets\nand liabilities of $0.4 million due to the final collection of escrow funds from the transaction.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on\nthe Company’s line of credit, net of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other\nexpense, net increased by $1.0 million as compared to the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase\nin interest expense, net. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowing. Borrowings increased primarily to\nfund treasury stock purchases.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company recognized $3.2 million of income tax expense for the thirty-nine weeks\nended September 30, 2023, as compared to $6.0 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated\neffective income tax rate for the current period was 21.9% as compared to 21.5% for the comparable prior-year\nperiod. The effective fiscal 2023 income tax rates as of September 30, 2023, were approximately 23.9%, 26.1% and\n13.3% in the United States, Canada, and Europe, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each\njurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of\nCanadian and European pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The effective income tax rate can also be\nimpacted by discrete permanent differences affecting any period presented. The primary reason for the decrease in\nthe consolidated effective rate in the current period was due to a permanent tax difference associated with the tax\ndeduction for equity grants in the United States that vested during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the\neffect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company.\nThe actual 2023 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in\nvarious jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-\nbased awards.\n38\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 1, 2022\n(Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $99.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 decreased\n19.5%, or $24.1 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue was driven by\nboth the Company’s school and non-school clients. Revenue from school clients for the thirty-nine weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was $73.2 million as compared to $90.4 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue\nfrom non-school clients for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 was $26.4 million as compared to $33.2\nmillion for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue decreases were primarily due to decreased demand associated\nwith COVID-19 transitioning from a high level of activity relating during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1,\n2022 to a lesser level of activity associated with the change of COVID-19 to an endemic during the thirty-nine\nweeks ended September 30, 2023. The Specialty Health Care segment’s gross profit decreased by 21.5%, or $7.9\nmillion, to $28.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $36.9 million for the\nprior-year period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by the decrease in revenue. Gross profit margin\nfor the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 decreased to 29.1% as compared to 29.8% for the comparable\nprior-year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to a mix shift for certain lower margin\nservices. Specialty Health Care experienced operating income of $9.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, as compared to $15.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the\ndecrease in operating income was the decrease in gross profit, offset by a decrease in SGA expense. SGA expense\ndecreased by $2.0 million to $19.2 million, as compared to $21.2 million in the comparable prior-year period. The\ndecrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a decrease in expenses associated with lower revenue and a lower\nallocation of corporate SGA expenses.\nThe Company believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic helped to increase Specialty Health Care revenue\nand gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the first half of fiscal 2022. The Company also believes the\nCOVID-19 pandemic began to shift to an endemic in the second half of fiscal 2022. As a result, COVID-19-related\nrevenue has decreased. However, the Company also believes that the demand for its Healthcare services is greater\nthan it had been before the COVID-19 pandemic. While the overall impact of these offsetting dynamics is uncertain,\nthe Company believes that, except for seasonality, it is well positioned for growth in revenue going forward.\n39\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 1, 2022\n(Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nEngineering\nEngineering revenue of $61.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 increased by $0.2 million,\ncompared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue comprised the following: decreases in\nAerospace revenue of $3.0 million and Industrial Processing revenue of $2.5 million, offset by an increase to Energy\nServices revenue of $5.7 million. The decrease in Aerospace revenue was primarily due to a contract reduction for\nthe Company’s major outsourcing client. The Company believes the decrease in Industrial Processing revenue was\nprimarily due to the irregular timing of large contracts with its Industrial Processing clients. Gross profit decreased\nby 9.9%, or $1.6 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit decreased because of a\ndecrease in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin of 23.4% for the current period decreased from 26.0% for the\ncomparable prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower utilization resulting\nfrom an increase in staff associated with lower revenue as the Company absorbed fixed salaried costs over lower\nrevenue. The Engineering segment experienced operating income of $1.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, as compared to $3.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in operating\nincome was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit.\nLife Sciences and Information Technology\nLife Sciences and Information Technology revenue of $30.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30,\n2023 increased by 5.5%, or $1.6 million, as compared to $29.1 million for the comparable prior-year period. Gross\nprofit of $11.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 increased 22.5%, or $2.1 million, as\ncompared to $9.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was due to the increase\nin revenue and an increase in gross profit margin. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit\nmargin for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 was 38.0% as compared to 32.7% for the comparable\nprior-year period. The Company attributes the gross profit margin increase to a concerted effort to increase gross\nprofit margin through its managed service offerings. The Life Sciences and Information Technology segment\nexperienced operating income of $4.5 million as compared to $3.3 million for the comparable prior-year period.\nThe increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset by an increase to SGA\nexpense. SGA expense increased to $6.9 million as compared to $6.1 million in the comparable prior-year period.\nThe increase in SGA expense was primarily due to the acquisition of TalentHerder in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2022 and a higher allocation of corporate SGA expenses.\n40\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the major captions from the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows (in thousands):\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nSeptember 30, October 1,\n2023 2022\nCash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $27,548 $20,741\nInvesting activities ($480 ) ($576 )\nFinancing activities ($26,558 ) ($19,468 )\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided $27.5 million of cash for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 as compared\nto providing $20.7 million in the comparable prior-year period. The major components of cash provided by\noperating activities in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and the comparable prior-year period are as\nfollows: net income, and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts\nreceivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued payroll and\nrelated costs, and deferred revenue.\nFor the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company experienced net income of $11.6 million as\ncompared to $16.1 million for the comparable prior-year period. An increase in accounts receivables in the thirty-\nnine weeks ended September 30, 2023 used $6.7 million of cash as compared to using $1.6 million in the\ncomparable prior-year period. The Company primarily attributes this increase in accounts receivables for the thirty-\nnine weeks ended September 30, 2023 to normal fluctuations in accounts receivable relative to revenue.\nWhile highly variable, the Company’s transit accounts payable typically exceeds the Company’s transit accounts\nreceivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course\nof business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable of $28.9 million\nas of September 30, 2023 and a net payable of $6.5 million as of December 31, 2022, providing $22.4 million of\ncash during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The net of transit accounts payable and transit\naccounts receivable was a net payable of $0.1 million as of October 1, 2022 and a net payable of $1.1 million as of\nJanuary 1, 2022, using $1.0 million of cash during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2022. The increase to net\ntransit payable as of September 30, 2023 was due to several large, multiyear EPC (Engineering, Procurement and\nConstruction) projects starting in the Company’s second fiscal quarter. In a typical EPC contract, the Company\nreceives significant cash upfront to fund equipment procurement and construction subcontractors throughout the\nproject.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets used cash of $0.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30,\n2023 as compared to providing $0.6 million of cash for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes\nchanges to prepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of\nbusiness. Since certain expenses are paid before a fiscal year concludes and are amortized over the next fiscal year,\nprepaid expenses and other current assets generally tend to increase at the end of a fiscal year and decrease during\nthe first three quarters of the following fiscal year.\n41\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nOperating Activities (Continued)\nA decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used cash of $1.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 as compared to providing $1.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. The Company\nattributes these changes to typical fluctuations in the normal course of business.\nChanges in accrued payroll and related costs provided $1.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30,\n2023 as compared to $4.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. There are four primary factors that\ngenerally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll\nand related costs is the Company’s largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other\nfactors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two\nweeks and normally has thirty-nine weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major\npayroll on the last business day of every other quarter; 3) the timing of various payroll related payments varies in the\nnormal course of business; and 4) most of the Company’s senior management participate in annual incentive plans\nand while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent\nthey are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive\nplan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The\nCompany’s last major payroll for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 was paid on September 22, 2023.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company deferred $3.3 million of employer payroll taxes under the CARES Act. Half of\nthese deferred payroll taxes were paid in fiscal December 2021 and the remaining portion was paid in fiscal\nDecember 2022.\nHistorically, the Company has experienced small deferred revenue balances. In fiscal 2022, the Company’s\nIndustrial Processing group secured several contracts with front-loaded payments, thereby generating larger deferred\nrevenue balances than typically generated. As a result, the Company’s deferred revenue balance as of September 30,\n2023 was $0.3 million, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2022, using cash from operations of $0.8\nmillion for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. While the Company expects to receive future upfront\npayments from its Industrial Processing clients, the Company cannot reasonably forecast deferred revenue balances\nas the timing of contract wins and front-loaded payments are typically haphazard.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $0.9 million for the purchase of property and equipment in the current period as compared\nto using $0.7 million in the comparable prior-year period. The thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and\nOctober 1, 2022 both included discrete gains associated with the Company’s sale of its Canada Power Systems\nbusiness unit.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities used $26.6 million of cash for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 as compared to\nusing $19.5 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Company made net payments under its line of credit\nof $2.1 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 as compared to making net payments of\n$13.0 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Company used $24.4 million to repurchase shares of its\ncommon stock in the current period as compared to $6.4 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Company\ngenerated cash of $0.7 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and $0.4 million for\nthe comparable prior-year period.\n42\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n(which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable margin,\ntypically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day\nincrements or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays\nunused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are\nrecorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the thirty-\nnine weeks ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 was 6.4% and 2.7%, respectively.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various\nfinancial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order to\npay dividends. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the\nRevolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants for\nthe foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $6.7 million and $8.8\nmillion, respectively. There were letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 for\n$2.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had\navailability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $36.3 million and $34.3 million,\nrespectively.\nIn addition to borrowings and sales of shares from its equity plans, the Company may raise capital through sales of\nshares of common stock under its at the market issuance program (the “ATM Program”) established under its May\n2021 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., as the agent (the “Agent”). The ATM\nProgram allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to\n$25.0 million from time to time through the Agent. To date, the Company has not sold any shares under the ATM\nProgram.\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations,\nand meet the other general cash needs of our business. Our liquidity is impacted by general economic, financial,\ncompetitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to\npay our expenses, principally labor-costs, and other related expenditures. We generally satisfy our liquidity needs\nthrough cash provided by operations and, when necessary, our revolving line of credit from Citizens Bank. The\nCompany believes it has a great deal of flexibility to reduce its costs if it becomes necessary. The Company believes\nthat it can satisfy its liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.\n43\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility (Continued)\nThe Company’s liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2023, included accounts receivable and total\ncurrent asset balances of $57.5 million and $73.0 million, respectively. Current liabilities were $67.3 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and were exceeded by total current assets by $5.7 million.\nThe Company experiences volatility in its daily cash flow and, at times, relies on the revolving line of credit to\nprovide daily liquidity for the Company’s financial operations. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in\ncompliance with all financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it\nwill maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes.\nFunding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from\none or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or\nfuture financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time\nin the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final\noutcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the\nresults of operations.\nThe Company’s business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through\nstrategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates.\nThe Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally\nincluded significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase\nhowever, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such\nopportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No\nassurance can be given as to the Company’s future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such\nopportunities will be financed.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of September 30, 2023, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss has\nnot been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could result in\nan unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company believes that such\nmatters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has accrued $2.8\nmillion for asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the\nCompany is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not determined if it\nhas any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually limited to an amount\nno higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found liable, any damages would be\ncovered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum coverage of $5.0 million. While the\nCompany attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has reserved $0.5 million for this project.\nThe Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3 million or that liability over $0.5 million, if\nany, will be covered by insurance.\n44\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCommitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the\nordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\nThe Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in\n1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company is currently\nimplementing an upgrade of its current system and expects to go live in 2024. The Company estimates this upgrade\nor replacement of its financial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\nThese estimates are subject to material change.\nThe Company’s current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes\nthat its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of\nbusiness for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates\nthrough November 2027. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nOperating Finance\nFiscal Year Leases Leases\n2023 (After September 30, 2023) $357 $117\n2024 754 233\n2025 493 -\n2026 409 -\n2027 302 -\nThereafter 1,455 -\nTotal lease payments $3,770 $350\nLess: imputed interest (504 ) (2 )\nTotal $3,266 $348\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had two acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets of\nThermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC, and 2) effective October 2, 2022, the\nCompany acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates future contingent payments at\nSeptember 30, 2023 as follows:\nTotal\nThe four quarters following September 30, 2023 $300\nThereafter 1,671\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $1,971\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of September 30, 2023. Contingent\nconsideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other\n(expense) income, net.\n45\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment\nportfolio and debt instruments, which primarily consist of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company does not\nhave any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio. The Company places its investments in instruments that\nmeet high credit quality standards. The Company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation\nof its invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. As of September 30, 2023, the\nCompany’s investments consisted of cash and money market funds. The Company does not use interest rate\nderivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the Company’s variable-rate line of\ncredit balances during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, if the interest rate on the Company’s\nvariable-rate line of credit (using an incremental borrowing rate) during the period had been 1.0% higher, the\nCompany’s interest expense on an annualized basis would have increased by $0.1 million. The Company does not\nexpect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Principal\nExecutive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period\ncovered by this report. As previously disclosed under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures” in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we identified deficiencies described below that existed as\nof December 31, 2022, and continued to exist at September 30, 2023. Based on our evaluation, our Principal\nExecutive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as such term is defined in Rule(s) 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective\nas of September 30, 2023, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting\ndescribed below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements\nwill not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement identified the following control deficiencies that resulted in material weaknesses in our internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The Company did not design and maintain information\ntechnology controls relevant to preparing its financial statements, specifically concerning (i) separation of duties to\nthe SAP ERP and General Ledger, (ii) adequate restriction of administrator-type access to SAP, (iii) program change\nmanagement controls, and (iv) user access controls that ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately\nrestrict user access to financial applications, programs, and data. As a result, the Company's related process-level IT-\ndependent manual and automated controls that rely upon the affected ITGCs, or information coming from IT\nsystems with affected ITGCs, were also deemed ineffective.\nThis material weakness did not result in a misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements.\n46\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (CONTINUED)\nPlanned Material Weakness Remediation Activities\nTo address these material weaknesses, we have commenced actions to formalize the Company's framework and\npolicies to maintain evidence in the operation of control procedures and improve our IT general controls. Our\nplanned remediation efforts related to the above-identified material weaknesses include, but are not limited to:\nx Investments to upgrade or replace existing systems that do not have the appropriate infrastructure to meet\nthe requirements of our internal control framework.\nx Expand the available resources at the Company with experience designing and implementing control\nactivities, including information technology general controls, with the advice from third-party consultants\nand specialists.\nx Assess segregation of duties and implement an annual user access review, including role design and\nprocess transformation to appropriately mitigate significant risks associated with conflicting responsibilities\nin financial systems.\nx Design and implement IT controls in change management that will ensure all changes are tested in staging,\napproved, and documented, and ensure that developers cannot deploy their own code to production.\nx Perform additional training to ensure a clear understanding of risk assessment, controls, and monitoring\nactivities related to automated processes, systems, and ITGCs related to financial reporting.\nWe will continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and take steps to\nremediate the known material weaknesses expeditiously. The implementation of these remediation efforts is in\nprogress, may require additional expenditures to implement, and will require validation and testing of the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles, and as a result, the\ntiming of when we will be able to remediate the material weaknesses fully is uncertain. We may also conclude that\nadditional measures may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting, which may necessitate further implementation and evaluation time.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nIn the third quarter, management has implemented and designed information technology general controls to address\nand mitigate the identified material weakness assessment. These controls encompass various measures, such as\nenhancing role design, eliminating sensitive access types, and segregating developers to prevent them from\npromoting their own changes. The company remains vigilant in its oversight of IT controls, continuously evaluating\ntheir effectiveness, and proactively upgrading existing systems and processes to rectify the material weakness in\nfinancial reporting controls, as defined by Rules 13a-1S(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.\nSignificant progress has been made in executing the remediation plan to rectify the previously disclose material\nweakness.

BUSINESS\nGeneral\nRCM Technologies, Inc. is a premier provider of business and technology solutions designed to enhance and\nmaximize the operational performance of its customers. The Company provides these services through the\ndeployment of specialty health care, engineering, life sciences, information technology services, data management\nand solutions. For over 50 years, the Company has developed and assembled an extensive portfolio of capabilities,\nservice offerings and delivery options with world class technical talent in key end markets and high-growth\nindustries. This combination, paired with RCM’s efficient pricing structure and global reach, offers clients a\ncompelling value proposition.\nRCM consists of three operating segments: Specialty Health Care, Engineering, and Life Sciences and Information\nTechnology services.\n The Specialty Health Care segment provides staffing solutions including medical health care professionals,\nhealth information management professionals, nurses, paraprofessionals, physicians and therapists for\nmany of the largest healthcare institutions and school districts across the United States. The segment also\nprovides Teletherapy services targeting the education sector with an emphasis on behavioral health.\n The Engineering segment provides a comprehensive portfolio of engineering and design services across\nthree verticals: (1) Energy Services, (2) Process & Industrial and (3) Aerospace. The segment also offers a\ncomplementary suite of consulting solutions and services to augment its engineering portfolio, including\ndesign and supply of high-quality engineered process solutions and equipment, data management, technical\nwriting and digital documentation across marine, locomotive, transportation and aerospace markets,\nintegrated design and construction, and engineering, procurement and construction management (“EPC”),\nas well as demand side management/energy conservation services. The business segment staffs engineers to\ndesign and build critical infrastructure projects for clients with international coverage.\n The Life Sciences and Information Technology, or LS&IT, segment provides enterprise business solutions,\napplication services, IT infrastructure solutions, life sciences solutions and other vertical-specific offerings.\nThe business segment includes data solutions, digitization, recruiting process outsourcing, human capital\nmanagement solutions, workforce management and consulting services.\nThe Company services some of the largest national and international companies in North America as well as a\nlengthy roster of Fortune 1000 and mid-sized global businesses in such industries as Aerospace/Defense,\nEducational Institutions, the Energy Sector, Financial Services, Health Care, Life Sciences, Manufacturing &\nDistribution, the Public Sector and Technology. RCM sells and delivers its services through a network of\napproximately 29 offices in selected regions throughout North America and Europe. The Company has staffed key\npersonnel to design and build internationally recognized critical infrastructure projects and retained strategic\npartners and client accounts for decades.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, approximately 51.7% of RCM’s total revenue were derived from\nSpecialty Health Care services, 32.2% from Engineering services, and the remaining 16.1% from Life Sciences and\nInformation Technology services.\nIndustry Overview\nBusinesses today face intense competition, the challenge of constant technological change and the ongoing need for\nbusiness process optimization. To address these issues and to compete more effectively, companies are continually\nevaluating the need for implementing innovative solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes. As\na result, the ability of an organization to integrate and align advanced technologies with new business objectives is\ncritical.\n2\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nIndustry Overview (Continued)\nIn the health care services industry, a shortage of nurses and other medical personnel in the United States has led to\nincreases in business activity for health care service companies, including the Company’s Specialty Health Care\ngroup. Due in part to an aging population and improved medical technology, the demand for selected health care\nprofessionals is expected to continue over the next several years, with an emphasis on leveraging technology to\nexpand access to care. The increased adoption of telemedicine, an area in which the Specialty Health Care group has\ndeveloped new service offerings, is a primary example. In addition, public educational institutions are outsourcing\ntheir requirements for school nurses, therapists and paraprofessionals to lower their costs and it is expected that this\nwill continue and grow. Each of these dynamics have been exacerbated by COVID-19. Various factors, including\nthe pandemic, technological advances and patient habits, have also altered patterns in health care delivery, with\nnewer delivery models gaining traction, namely telemedicine. Given federal and state regulatory changes as well as\nprivate insurer reimbursement methods, utilization of telemedicine services increased significantly. CDC\nresearchers stated that maintaining the expansion of telehealth remains critical to providing access to care. It is\nexpected the total addressable market opportunity will continue to expand and grow. Expanding access to behavioral\nhealth and mental well-being is also a priority for public health officials. Increasing and maintaining access to\nproper care remains a top priority and the market opportunity for these services is expected to continue to grow.\nWhile the Company believes that the demand for Healthcare related services remains historically high, the Company\nalso believes this demand subsided some as COVID-19 shifted from a pandemic to an endemic.\nThe Company’s Engineering group remains focused on areas of growth, primarily within the utility/electric power,\naerospace, marine and transportation, commercial and industrial, oil and gas, as well as biofuel industries. Given the\ncurrent composition of its customer base, the Engineering group’s performance is well balanced between its three\nsegments. In recent years, many electric utilities have prioritized transitioning their power generation assets to\ncleaner sources of energy. Much of this transformation is being driven by investments in renewable energy. The\nEnergy Information Administration (“EIA”) estimates that 38% of the United States’ electric generation capacity\nwill be comprised of wind and solar assets by 2050. This expansion will require extensive investment in the nation’s\ntransmission infrastructure to interconnect these renewable resources to the energy grid. Projects of this scale will\nrequire engineering and design expertise, as well as the utilization of integrated design and EPC services. As the\nworld’s industrial output rebounds from pandemic-related weakness in 2020 and 2021, the Company believes its\nProcess and Industrial group is positioned well to take advantage. Companies in the chemical industry are\nreprioritizing spending towards decarbonization technologies, with many U.S. chemical companies expecting to\nplace an emphasis on renewable feedstocks and new carbon recycling technologies. The Company believes its\nprocess engineering services can play a vital role across this multibillion-dollar opportunity.\nCompanies must integrate and manage computing environments consisting of multiple computing platforms,\noperating systems, databases and networking protocols and off-the-shelf software applications to support business\nobjectives. Companies also need to keep pace with new technology developments, which often rapidly render\nexisting equipment and internal skills obsolete. At the same time, varied factors have caused many organizations to\nfocus on core competencies and trim workforces in the IT and data management area. Accordingly, these\norganizations often lack the quantity, quality and variety of IT skills necessary to design and support IT and data\nsolutions. IT managers are charged with supporting increasingly complex systems and applications of significant\nstrategic value, while working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints within their own organizations.\nThe Company believes its target market for IT services and data solutions is among middle-market companies,\nwhich typically lack the time and technical resources to satisfy all of their IT needs internally. These companies\ncommonly require sophisticated, experienced IT assistance to achieve their business objectives and often rely on IT\nservice providers to help implement and manage their systems. RCM is structured to provide middle-market\ncompanies a single source for their IT and digitization needs.\n3\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nBusiness Strategy\nThe Company is dedicated to providing solutions to meet its clients’ business needs by delivering specialty health\ncare, engineering, life sciences and information technology services. The Company’s objective is to remain a\nrecognized leader of specialized professional staffing, consulting services and solutions in major markets throughout\nNorth America. The Company adapts operating strategies to achieve this objective. The following is a discussion\nof the key elements of its growth and operating strategies:\nGrowth Strategy\nPromote Full Life Cycle Solution Capability\nThe Company promotes a full life cycle solution capability to its customers. The goal of the full life cycle solution\nstrategy is to fully address a client’s project implementation cycle at each stage of its design, development and\ndeployment. This entails the Company working with its clients from the initial conceptualization of a project\nthrough its design and project execution, and extending into ongoing management and support of the delivered\nproduct. RCM’s strategy is to build projects and integrated solutions offerings selectively, utilizing its extensive\nresource base.\nThe Company believes that the effective execution of this strategy will generate improved margins on its existing\nresources. The completion of this service-offering continuum is intended to afford the Company the opportunity to\nstrengthen long-term client relationships that will further contribute to a more predictable revenue stream.\nIn addition to a full life cycle solution offering, the Company continues to focus on transitioning into higher value\noriented services in an effort to increase its margins on its various service lines and generate revenue that is more\nsustainable. The Company believes this transition is accomplished by pursuing additional vertical market specific\nsolutions in conjunction or combination with longer-term based solutions, through expansion of its global client\nrelationships and by pursuing strategic alliances and partnerships.\nAchieve Internal Growth\nThe Company continues to promote its internal growth strategies which it designed to better serve the Company’s\ncustomers, generate higher revenue and achieve greater operating efficiencies. Every division of the Company\ncontinuously focuses on services and client portfolio diversification. Business units are collaborating on penetrating\nand servicing accounts as sales teams are increasing their activity levels. This enables clients to be supported by\nspecialists in their areas of need while RCM productivity increases.\nRCM provides an orientation program in which sales managers and professionals receive relevant information about\nCompany operations.\nRCM has adopted an industry-centric approach to sales and marketing. This initiative contemplates that clients\nwithin the same industry sectors tend to have common business challenges. It therefore allows the Company to\npresent and deliver enhanced value to those clients in the vertical markets in which RCM has assembled the greatest\nwork experience. RCM’s consultants continue to acquire project experience that offers differentiated awareness of\nthe business challenges that clients in that industry are facing. This alignment also facilitates and creates additional\ninnovative cross-selling opportunities. The Company believes this strategy will lead to greater account penetration,\nstrategic partnerships, and enhanced client relationships.\nOperational strategies contributing to RCM’s internal productivity include the delineation of certain new solutions\npractice areas in markets where its clients had historically known the Company as a contract service provider. The\nformation of these new practice areas facilitates the flow of project opportunities and the delivery of project-based\nsolutions.\n4\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nGrowth Strategy (Continued)\nPursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions\nThe industries in which the Company operates continue to be highly fragmented, and the Company plans to continue\nto selectively assess opportunities to make strategic acquisitions as such opportunities are presented to the Company.\nThe Company's acquisition strategy is designed to broaden the scope of services and technical competencies and\ngrow its full life cycle solution capabilities. In considering acquisition opportunities, the Company focuses\nprincipally on companies with (i) technologies or market segments RCM has targeted for strategic value\nenhancement, (ii) margins that are accretive to existing margins, (iii) experienced management personnel, (iv)\nsubstantial growth prospects and (v) sellers who desire to join the Company’s management team. To retain and\nprovide incentives for management of its acquired companies, the Company has generally structured a significant\nportion of the acquisition price in the form of multi-tiered consideration based on growth of operating profitability of\nthe acquired company over a two-to-four-year period.\nOperating Strategy\nDevelop and Maintain Strong Customer Relationships\nThe Company seeks to develop and maintain strong cross-functional customer relationships by anticipating and\nfocusing on its customers’ needs. The Company emphasizes a relationship-oriented and partnership-based approach\nto business, rather than the transaction or assignment-oriented approach that the Company believes is used by many\nof its competitors. This industry-centric strategy is designed to allow RCM to expand further its relationships with\nclients in RCM’s targeted sectors.\nTo develop close customer relationships, the Company’s practice managers and/or salespeople regularly meet with\nboth existing and prospective clients to identify areas of need and help design solutions and identify the resources\nneeded to execute their strategies. The Company’s managers also maintain close communications with their\ncustomers during each project and on an ongoing basis after its completion. The Company believes that this\nrelationship-oriented approach can result in greater customer satisfaction. Additionally, the Company believes that\nby collaborating with its customers in designing business solutions, it can generate new opportunities to cross-sell\nadditional services that the Company has to offer. The Company focuses on providing customers with qualified\nindividuals or teams of experts compatible with the business needs of its customers and makes a concerted effort to\nfollow the progress of such relationships to ensure their continued success.\nAttract and Retain Highly Qualified Consultants and Technical Resources\nThe Company believes it has been successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified consultants and contractors\nby (i) providing stimulating and challenging work assignments while fostering a culture of innovation, (ii) offering\ncompetitive wages, (iii) effectively communicating with its candidates, (iv) providing selective training to maintain\nand upgrade skills and (v) aligning the needs of its customers with appropriately skilled personnel. The Company\nbelieves it has been successful in retaining these personnel due in part to its use of practice managers who are\ndedicated to maintaining contact with, and monitoring the satisfaction levels of, the Company’s consultants and\ncontractors while they are on assignment.\n5\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nSpecialty Health Care\nThe Company’s Specialty Health Care Group specializes in long-term and short-term staffing of medical\nprofessionals as well as executive search, international recruitment, and placement solutions for many of the largest\nhealthcare institutions and school districts across the United States. The segment’s portfolio of services includes, but\nis not limited to, the following fields:\n Allied and Therapy Staffing: Specializes in recruiting outstanding professionals across the health care\nindustry. Our allied health care professionals and therapists work in schools, health systems, hospitals,\nnursing homes, and rehabilitation facilities.\n Correctional Healthcare Staffing: Staffing services for local, state and federal correctional facilities and\nprovide screening, onboarding, and employee assessments as well as employee and inmate vaccination and\ntreatment services.\n Health Information Management: Provide healthcare organizations with experienced medical coding\nprofessionals that manage staffing shortages, backlogs, vacation coverage and long-term coding support.\n Nursing Services: Provides nurse placement and staffing services in healthcare facilities, schools, hospitals\nand correctional facilities.\n Physicians and Advanced Practice: Our national locum tenens (temporary practitioner) practice\nspecializes in placing physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners.\n School Staffing and Recruitment: Provides full-time and part-time nurse employment services for school\ndistricts across the country. The Company also offers other health care professionals to perform school\nevaluations and treat students, including occupational and physical therapists, speech and language\npathologists, as well as special education support services and registered behavioral technicians to support\nstudents’ individualized education plan and behavioral health needs.\n Telepractice: The Company’s teletherapy solution is an evidence-based service delivery option for\nstudents to receive Special Education services such as Speech-Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy,\nPhysical Therapy, Behavioral and Mental Health services and other healthcare services through an online\nplatform.\nMaintaining the utilization of telemedicine has become and remains critical to providing necessary access to care.\nExpanding access to behavioral health and mental wellness services is also a priority for many public health\nofficials. The Company’s School Services and Telepractice offerings are well positioned to provide solutions in\nthese areas of priority as the market opportunity for these services is expected to continue to grow.\nAs of December 30, 2023, the Company assigned approximately 2,780 specialty health care services personnel to its\ncustomers.\n6\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nEngineering\nRCM provides a full range of Engineering services including Project Management Engineering & Design,\nEngineering Analysis, Engineering-Procurement-Construction, Configuration Management, Hardware/Software\nValidation & Verification, Quality Assurance, Technical Writing & Publications, Manufacturing Process Planning\n& Improvement and 3D/BIM Integrated Design. Engineering services are provided at the site of the client or at the\nCompany’s own facilities.\nThe Company’s Engineering segment consists of three business units – Energy Services, Aerospace Services and\nProcess & Industrial Services.\n Energy Services: Provides solutions to the utility industry, including power generation and transmission\nand distribution. The group has highly technical project experience that encompasses multi-disciplined\nengineering and design services as well as providing technical support during design, construction and\nplant operational phases. The Company believes that the deregulation of the utilities industry and the aging\nof nuclear power plants offer the Company an opportunity to capture a greater share of professional\nservices and project management requirements of the utilities industry. Electric utilities have prioritized\ntransitioning their power generation assets to cleaner sources of energy and grid modernization initiatives.\nThis expansion requires large-scale investment in the nation’s transmission infrastructure to interconnect\nthese renewable resources to the energy grid.\n Aerospace Services: Provides engineering and technical services to the aerospace & defense industry.\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”), the Department of Defense plans to spend over $1\ntrillion in procurement-related aviation expenditures over the next three decades. Given RCM’s customer\naccount relationships with several of the largest defense prime contractors, the Company believes there is\nample opportunity for engineering services and technical publication work, including production and\nprocurement engineering services as well as the need for sustainment and development program publication\nservices, data management and digital solutions.\n Process & Industrial Services: Provides engineering services to the industrial, chemical, commercial and\noil and gas industries in the United States, Europe and Canada. With many companies in the chemical\nindustry reprioritizing spending towards decarbonization technologies, many U.S. chemical companies are\nexpected to place an emphasis on renewable feedstocks and new carbon recycling technologies. The\nCompany believes its process engineering services and specialized hydrogen capabilities can play a vital\nrole across this multibillion-dollar opportunity.\nThe Company provides its engineering services through a number of delivery methods. These include managed\ntasks and resources, complete project services, outsourcing, both on and off-site, and a full complement of\nresourcing alternatives.\nAs of December 30, 2023, the Company assigned approximately 440 engineering and technical personnel to its\ncustomers.\n7\nITEM 1.

BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nBranch Offices\nThe Company’s organization consists of 29 branch offices located in the United States, Canada, Germany, Puerto\nRico and Serbia. The locations and services of each of the branch offices are set forth in the table below.\nNUMBER OF SERVICES\nLOCATION OFFICES PROVIDED(1)\nUNITED STATES\nArizona 1 HC\nCalifornia 3 HC\nConnecticut 1 E\nFlorida 2 HC, E\nHawaii 1 HC\nIllinois 1 HC\nMassachusetts 1 HC\nMichigan 1 HC\nNew Jersey 2 E, LS&IT\nNew York 4 E, HC, LS&IT\nNorth Carolina 1 HC\nRhode Island 1 E\nTennessee 1 HC\nTexas 1 HC\n21\nCANADA 1 E\nGERMANY 1 E\nPUERTO RICO 2 E, LS&IT\nSERBIA 4 E, LS&IT\n(1) Services provided are abbreviated as follows:\nE - Engineering\nHC - Specialty Health Care\nLS&IT - Life Sciences and Information Technology\nThe Company is domiciled in the United States and its segments operate in the United States, Canada, Germany,\nPuerto Rico and Serbia.\n9\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nInternational Operations\nThe Company operates its business in Canada and, to a less significant extent, in Germany, Puerto Rico and Serbia.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, approximately 6.3% of the Company’s revenue were generated\noutside the United States. There are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including: the\nimposition of trade barriers, foreign exchange restrictions, longer payment cycles, greater difficulties in accounts\nreceivables collection, difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws (including without limitation the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act), changes in legal or regulatory requirements, difficulties in staffing and managing\nforeign operations, complex and uncertain employment environments, political instability and potentially adverse\ntax consequences. Our operations in Serbia could be adversely affected by the current conflict between Ukraine and\nRussia, with which Serbia has substantial ties. Should sanctions against Russia affect Russia in a way that causes\nadverse economic consequences to Serbia, or if such sanctions were to be extended to countries that might be\nconsidered to be in alignment with Russia, thus could have a negative impact on our employees or operations both\nwithin and outside Serbia. To the extent the Company experiences these risks, the business and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nFrom its headquarters locations in New Jersey, the Company provides its branch offices with centralized\nadministrative, marketing, finance, MIS, human resources and legal support. Centralized administrative functions\nand shared services minimize the administrative burdens on branch office managers and allow them to spend more\ntime focusing on sales and marketing, client relations and practice development activities.\nBranch offices are primarily located in markets that the Company believes have strong growth prospects for the\nCompany’s services. The Company’s branches are operated in a decentralized, entrepreneurial manner with most\noffices operating as independent profit centers.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing efforts are conducted at the local and national level through the Company’s network of branch\noffices. Business development and sales activities and productivity are tracked and rankings established and\npublished. Sales between business units are recognized and financially encouraged. The Company emphasizes\nlong-term relationships and partnerships with customers that are developed through regular assessment of customer\nrequirements and proactive monitoring of service performance. The Company’s sales and account management\npersonnel make regular visits to existing and prospective customers. New customers are obtained through active\nsales programs and referrals. The Company encourages its employees to participate in and support national and\nregional trade associations, economic development agencies, local chambers of commerce and other civic\nassociations. The Company seeks to develop strategic partnering relationships with its customers by providing\ncomprehensive solutions for all aspects of a customer’s engineering, life sciences, information technology and other\nprofessional services needs. The Company concentrates on providing carefully screened professionals with a range\nof highly specialized and technical skills in a timely manner and at competitive prices. The Company regularly\nmonitors the quality of the services provided by its personnel and obtains feedback from its customers as to their\nsatisfaction with the services provided.\nThe Company serves Fortune 1000 companies and many middle market clients, competing on a national and global\nscale. The Company’s relationships with these customers are typically formed at the customers’ local or regional\nlevel and from time to time, when appropriate, at the corporate level for national accounts.\n10\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nKey Customers\nThe Company has established long-term relationships with many of its customers across each of its business\nsegments. The Company’s emphasis on client retention has resulted in repeat business from many of its largest\nstrategic accounts. During the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, the Company had two customers exceed 10%\nof consolidated revenue, representing 17.1% and 10.1% of consolidated revenue. The Company’s five, ten and\ntwenty largest customers accounted for approximately 39.1%, 50.4% and 62.7%, respectively, of the Company’s\nrevenue for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\nOther Information\nSafeguards - Business, Disaster and Contingency Planning\nThe Company has implemented a number of safeguards to protect the Company from various system-related risks\nincluding Redundant Telecommunications and server systems architecture, multi-tiered server and desktop backup\ninfrastructure, and data center physical and environmental controls. In addition, the Company has\ndeveloped disaster recovery / business continuity procedures for all offices.\nGiven the significant amount of data generated in the Company’s key processes including recruiting, sales, payroll\nand customer invoicing, the Company has established redundant procedures, functioning on a daily basis, within the\nCompany’s primary data center, which is a third-party Internet Data Center (“IDC”). This redundancy should\nmitigate the risks related to hardware, application and data loss by utilizing the concept of live differential backups\nof servers and desktops to Storage Area Network (SAN) devices on its backup LAN, culminating in offsite tape\nstorage at an independent facility. Controls within the data center environment ensure that all systems are\nproactively monitored and data is properly archived.\nAdditionally, the Company has contracted and brokered strategic relationships with third-party vendors to meet its\nrecovery objectives in the event of a system disruption. For example, comprehensive service level agreements for\nthe Company’s data circuits and network devices guarantee minimal outages as well as network redundancy and\nscalability.\nThe Company’s ability to protect its data assets against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failures,\nand facility violations is critical. To address potential cyber security threats, the Company uses a third-party mail\nmanagement service to filter all emails destined for the RCMT domain before being delivered to the corporate mail\nservers. The service has also been deployed to safeguard the enterprise from malicious internet content. The\ndeployment of virus, spam, and patch management controls extends from the perimeter network to all desktops and\nis centrally monitored and managed. In addition to the virus and malware controls, an Intrusion Protection System\n(IPS) monitors and alerts on changes in network traffic patterns as well as known hostile signatures.\nThe Company maintains a disaster recovery plan that outlines the recovery time / point objectives (RTO / RPO),\norganization structure, roles and procedures, including site addendum disaster plans for all of its key operating\noffices. Corporate IT personnel regulate the maintenance and integrity of backed-up data throughout the Company.\nThe IDC provides the Company with a robust data center environment with redundant HVAC, commercial power\nfeeds, ten 2000kW diesel generator sets with five 10,000-gallon, above-ground fuel oil storage tanks to provide\nstandby power and dry pipe fire suppression. In addition, the IDC provides 24x7 security staffing, closed-circuit\nmonitors, secure-card key access, biometrics scanners, man traps, and alarmed doors.\n11\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nCompetition\nThe market for engineering and Life Sciences and IT services is highly competitive and is subject to rapid change.\nAs the market demand has shifted, many software companies have adopted tactics to pursue services and consulting\nofferings making them direct competitors when in the past they may have been alliance partners. Primary\ncompetitors include participants from a variety of market segments, including publicly and privately held firms,\nsystems consulting and implementation firms, application software firms, service groups of computer equipment\ncompanies, facilities management companies, general management consulting firms and staffing companies. In\naddition, the Company competes with its clients’ internal resources, particularly where these resources represent a\nfixed cost to the client. Such competition may impose additional pricing pressures on the Company.\nThe Company believes its principal competitive advantages in the engineering and life sciences and information\ntechnology services market include: strong relationships with existing clients, a long-term track record with over\n1,000 clients, a broad range of services, technical expertise, knowledge and experience in multiple industry sectors,\nquality and flexibility of service, responsiveness to client needs and speed in delivering life sciences and information\ntechnology solutions.\nAdditionally, the Company competes for suitable acquisition candidates based on its differentiated acquisition\nmodel, its entrepreneurial and decentralized operating philosophy, and its strong corporate-level support and\nresources.\nSeasonality\nThe Company’s operating results can be affected by the seasonal fluctuations in client expenditures. Expenditures\nin the Engineering, Life Sciences and Information Technology segments can be negatively impacted during the first\nquarter of the year when clients are finalizing their budgets. Quarterly results generally fluctuate depending on,\namong other things, the number of billing days in a quarter and the seasonality of clients’ businesses. The business is\nalso affected by the timing of holidays and seasonal vacation patterns, generally resulting in lower revenue and gross\nprofit in the fourth quarter of each year, not considering any non-seasonal impact. Extreme weather conditions may\nalso affect demand in the first and fourth quarters of the year as certain clients’ facilities are located in geographic\nareas subject to closure or reduced hours due to inclement weather. The Company generally experiences an increase\nin its cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross profit and gross margin percentage in the first and second\nfiscal quarters of each year as a result of resetting certain state and federal employment tax rates and related salary\nlimitations. Also, the Company’s Specialty Health Care segment typically experiences a significant decline in\nrevenue due to the substantial closure of one of its largest customers, the New York City Department of Education,\nand other educational institution clients during the third quarter due to their summer recess.\nGovernment Regulations\nThe Company is a consulting firm and employment service provider and is generally subject to one or more of the\nfollowing types of government regulation: (1) regulation of the employer/employee relationship between a firm and\nits employees, including tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, benefits, workplace compliance,\nwage and hour, anti-discrimination, immigration and workers’ compensation, (2) registration, licensing, record\nkeeping and reporting requirements, and (3) federal contractor compliance. The Company believes it is in material\ncompliance with all employee related statutes.\nIntellectual Property\nManagement believes the RCM Technologies, Inc. name is extremely valuable and important to its business. The\nCompany endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights and maintain certain trademarks, trade names, service\nmarks and other intellectual property rights, including The Source of Smart Solutions® and Industries of Tomorrow,\nToday™ with a trademark application submitted for the use of the latter. The Company is not currently aware of\nany infringing uses or other conditions that would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the\nCompany’s use of its proprietary rights.\n12\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nHuman Capital\nOur employees and contractors (together, our \"workforce\") are the Company's most valuable resource for current\nand future success. We promote an environment that ensures safety, encourages diversity and inclusion, fosters\ngrowth and self-development, and provides meaningful work. All employees participate in our success through\nattractive and aligned rewards. Notable programs we offer to our full-time employees include:\n Compensation packages that are market competitive, taking into account the location and responsibilities of\nthe role;\n The majority of full-time, salaried employees are eligible for incentive-based compensation such as\nperformance bonuses and commissions;\n High-quality employer-sponsored health insurance;\n Access to numerous other employer-sponsored and employee-sponsored benefit plans;\n Employer 401(k) matching contributions;\n Employee stock purchase plan (at least a 15% discount to market value at the time of purchase)\nOur recruiting teams use internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we\nencourage and reward workforce referrals for open positions.\nIn addition to our comprehensive investment in our workforce success, we strive to maintain an inclusive\nenvironment that values and leverages the uniqueness of each person to the benefit of all our stakeholders. We view\nthe combination of diverse perspectives and backgrounds as a powerful force for innovation. To promote diversity\nand our core principles, we emphasize dignity, value, and equality of all members, regardless of race, color, religion,\nage, gender, or sexual orientation, through our actions and the workplace training programs we provide. We\ncontinually strive to harness the diversity of our global workforce by cultivating a climate that permits all of our\nworkforce to bring their authentic selves to work every day.\nThe health and safety of our workforce are also a top priority. We have implemented appropriate procedures and\nprecautions to ensure our workforce's continued safety and well-being. We strive to comply with all federal and\nlocal workplace laws and regulations where we do business. We are always looking for ways to exceed compliance\nstandards by utilizing continuous improvement discipline to eliminate risks in the workplace proactively.\nThe Company believes promoting engagement and empowering its workforce drives better business results. As a\nresult, the Company believes it has an \"open door\" culture whereby every member of its workforce is comfortable\nexpressing their ideas on improving the Company and its performance. Our culture has resulted in action plans at all\nlevels of the organization and drives continuous conversations on the things that matter most to our workforce and\ntheir teams.\nThe Company's employees and contractors are generally divided into four groups: 1) Nonbillable employees; 2)\nBillable salaried employees; 3) Billable hourly long-term employees; 4) Billable hourly short-term employees and\ncontractors.\nNonbillable employees are primarily full-time and salaried. These positions include but are not limited to\nexecutives, managers, general administration, finance, accounting, account managers, recruiters, credentialers,\netcetera. These employees are not billed to clients. As of December 30, 2023, the Company employed\napproximately 300 nonbillable employees. The expense for these employees is included in the Company's selling,\ngeneral, and administrative expense in its income statements.\n13\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nBillable salaried employees primarily include senior-level employees whose time is often billed to clients. These\nemployees tend to be long-term in nature. Many are intended to produce high utilization rates (representing the\npercentage of their time billed to clients), often in the 90% to 100% range. However, some have nonbillable\nresponsibilities such as account management, client proposal preparation, general strategy formulation, expert\ncontent generation, project controls, overseeing projects where their time is not billable, supervising billable\npersonnel, etcetera. These employees' utilization rates generally range from 20% to 90%. Most of the expense for\nbillable salaried employees are included in the Company's direct costs in its income statements.\nBillable hourly long-term employees have very high utilization, typically in the 90% to 100%. For most of these\nemployees, our goal is near 100% utilization. They are hired with the idea that we want them to work on multiple\nassignments, either in succession or simultaneously. Billable hourly short-term employees have near 100%\nutilization. They are typically hired for one assignment, and upon completion, they terminate.\nAs of December 30, 2023, our billable workforce comprised approximately 2,780 Specialty Health Care services\npersonnel, 440 Engineering and Technical personnel, and 270 Life Sciences and Information Technology personnel\nassigned by the Company to work on client projects or assignments for various periods. None of the Company's\nemployees are party to a collective bargaining agreement.\nThe Company conducts business globally but is principally concentrated in North America and Europe. As of\nDecember 30, 2023, the Company's workforce breaks out as follows:\n United States and Puerto Rico: approximately 235 nonbillable and 3,375 billable\n International (primarily Canada and Europe): approximately 45 nonbillable and 115 billable\nAccess to Company Information\nThe Company is a Nevada corporation organized in 1971. The address of its principal executive office is 2500\nMcClellan Avenue, Suite 350, Pennsauken, NJ 08109-4613.\nThe Company electronically files its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on\nForm 8-K and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC\nmaintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxies, information statements, and other\ninformation regarding issuers that file electronically.\nThe Company makes available on its website or by responding free of charge to requests addressed to the\nCompany’s Corporate Secretary, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports\non Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a)\nand 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These reports are available as soon as reasonably\npracticable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The Company’s website is\nhttp://www.rcmt.com. The information contained on the Company’s website, or on other websites linked to the\nCompany’s website, is not part of this document. Reference herein to the Company’s website is an inactive text\nreference only.\nThe Company has adopted a Code of Conduct applicable to all of its directors, officers and employees. In addition,\nthe Company has adopted a Code of Ethics, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules, applicable to its Chief\nExecutive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller. Both the Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics are\navailable, free of charge, by sending a written request to the Company’s Corporate Secretary. If the Company makes\nany amendments to either of these Codes (other than technical, administrative, or other non-substantive\namendments), or waives (explicitly or implicitly) any provision of the Code of Ethics to the benefit of its Chief\nExecutive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Controller, it intends to disclose the nature of the amendment or\nwaiver, its effective date and to whom it applies in the investor relations portion of the website, or in a report on\nForm 8-K filed with the SEC.\n14\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company’s business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond its control. The risk and\nuncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Set forth below is a discussion of the risks\nand uncertainties that management believes to be material to the Company.\nEconomic Trends\nAdverse global economic conditions, when they occur, may create conditions such as increases in inflation, higher\ninterest rates, a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and\nbankruptcy, and volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. Any or all of these developments can\nnegatively affect the Company’s business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways. For\nexample, current or potential customers may be unable to fund capital spending programs, new product launches of\nother similar endeavors whereby they might procure services from the Company, and therefore delay, decrease or\ncancel purchases of services or not pay or delay paying for previously purchased services. In addition, these\nconditions may cause the Company to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize existing\ndebt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for operations, investing activities (including the financing of any future\nacquisitions), or financing activities, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nGovernment Regulations\nStaffing firms and employment service providers are generally subject to one or more of the following types of\ngovernment regulation: (1) regulation of the employer/employee relationship between a firm and its employees,\nincluding tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, benefits, workplace compliance, wage and\nhour, anti-discrimination, immigration and workers’ compensation; (2) registration, licensing, record keeping and\nreporting requirements; and (3) federal contractor compliance. Failure to comply with these regulations could result\nin the Company incurring penalties and other liabilities, monetary and otherwise.\nHighly Competitive Business\nThe staffing services and outsourcing markets are highly competitive and have limited barriers to entry. The\nCompany competes in global, national, regional, and local markets with numerous temporary staffing and permanent\nplacement companies. Price competition in the staffing industry is significant and pricing pressures from\ncompetitors and customers are increasing. In addition, there is increasing pressure on companies to outsource\ncertain areas of their business to low cost offshore outsourcing firms. The Company expects that the level of\ncompetition will remain high in the future, which could limit the Company’s ability to maintain or increase its\nmarket share or profitability. Our inability to compete successfully with our competitors could adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeasonality of Business\nAs described in “Item 1. Business,” our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with reduced demand\noften occurring during the first quarter of the year when clients are finalizing their engineering and Life Sciences\nand IT budgets, and also during periods in which there are a substantial amount of holidays and season vacations. In\nparticular, one of the largest customers in our Specialty Health Care group, the New York City Department of\nEducation, significantly reduces activity during the third quarter, when schools are closed for summer recess. Our\noperating results for any given period may fluctuate as a result of the timing of holidays, vacations and other events,\nand if we were to experience unfavorable performance during periods in which we would otherwise expect to have\nhigh seasonal demand, we may have limited ability to make up for such performance during periods of seasonally\nlower demand.\n15\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nEvents Affecting Significant Customers\nAs disclosed in “Item 1. Business,” during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, the Company had two\ncustomers exceed 10% of consolidated revenue, representing 17.1% and 10.1% of consolidated revenue. The\nCompany’s five, ten and twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 39.1%, 50.4% and 62.7%,\nrespectively, of the Company’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. The Company’s customers\nmay be affected by the current state of the economy or developments in the credit markets or may engage in mergers\nor similar transactions. In addition, customers may choose to reduce the business they do with the Company for\nother reasons or no reason. The Company could also be materially impacted by actions of prime contractors\nwhereby the Company derives revenue through a subcontractor relationship. Should any significant customers\nexperience a downturn in their business that weakens their financial condition or merge with another company or\notherwise cease independent operation, or limit their relationship with us, it is possible that the business that the\ncustomer does with the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which could adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nSubcontractors, Transit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payables Related to Construction\nManagement Contracts\nThe Company’s Engineering segment has entered into arrangements to provide construction management and\nengineering services to customers under which arrangements the Company then engages subcontractors to provide\nthe construction services. Ultimately, as a primary contractor, the Company is responsible for the nonperformance\nor negligence of its subcontractors, whom the Company requires to be adequately insured and to issue performance\nbonds for their assignment. Should a subcontractor not perform or act negligently and should there be inadequate\ninsurance or performance bonds in place, the Company might not be able to mitigate its primary liability to the\ncustomer, and the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely\naffected. In addition, while payments to subcontractors typically are due from the Company only after the Company\nreceives payment from the ultimate customer, the Company faces the risk that, should a customer not pay the\nCompany, or should a subcontractor demand payment from the Company prior to the Company’s receipt of payment\nfrom its customer, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\nDependence Upon Personnel\nThe Company’s operations depend on the continued efforts of its officers and other executive management. The\nloss of key officers and members of executive management may cause a significant disruption to the Company’s\nbusiness.\nThe Company also depends on the performance and productivity of its local managers and field personnel. The\nCompany’s ability to attract and retain new business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of\nservice rendered. The loss of key managers and field personnel may also jeopardize existing client relationships\nwith businesses that continue to use the Company’s services based upon past relationships with local managers and\nfield personnel. In order to fulfill the requirements of the Company’s customers, the Company must be able to\nrecruit and retain appropriate personnel for client assignments.\n16\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nRevolving Credit Facility and Liquidity\nIf the Company were unable to borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility (see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing\nActivities”), it may adversely affect liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s\nliquidity depends on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and, from time to time, borrowings\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility with the Company’s agent lender Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania. The Company\nbelieves that Citizens Bank is liquid and is not aware of any current risk that they will become illiquid. At\nDecember 30, 2023, the Company had $30.9 million in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility outstanding\nand $2.0 million outstanding under letters of credit, with availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving\nCredit Facility of $12.1 million.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate),\nplus applicable margin or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company\nalso pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees\nare recorded as interest expense.\nAll borrowings under the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement remain collateralized with substantially all\nof the Company’s assets, as well as the capital stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains\nvarious financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in\norder to pay dividends. As of December 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in\nthe Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants\nfor the foreseeable future.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations and Changes in Exchange Rates\nThe Company is exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates. The\nCompany’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations relates to operations in Canada, Germany and Serbia,\nprincipally conducted through its Canadian, German and Serbian subsidiaries. Exchange rate fluctuations affect the\nUnited States dollar value of reported earnings derived from the foreign operations as well as the carrying value of\nthe Company’s investment in the net assets related to these operations. The Company does not engage in hedging\nactivities with respect to foreign operations.\nChanges in Tax Laws\nAt any time, United States federal tax laws or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be changed. As a\nresult, changes in United States federal tax laws could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition\nand business operations, and adversely impact the Company’s shareholders. At any time, tax laws in the Company’s\nother jurisdictions, Canada, Germany, Puerto Rico and Serbia, may also change. These tax law changes may have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s income tax expense.\nWorkers’ Compensation and Employee Medical Insurance\nThe Company self-insures a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers’ compensation and employees’\nmedical insurance. The Company has established reserves for workers’ compensation and employee medical\ninsurance claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic independent actuarial valuations. Significant\ndifferences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Company’s future\nfinancial results.\n17\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nImproper Activities of Temporary Professionals Could Result in Damage to Business Reputation,\nDiscontinuation of Client Relationships and Exposure to Liability\nThe Company may be subject to claims by clients related to errors and omissions, misuse of proprietary information,\ndiscrimination and harassment, theft and other criminal activity, malpractice, and other claims stemming from the\nimproper activities or alleged activities of temporary professionals. There can be no assurance that current liability\ninsurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available in sufficient amounts to cover damages or other\ncosts associated with such claims.\nClaims raised by clients stemming from the improper actions of temporary professionals, even if without merit,\ncould cause the Company to incur significant expense associated with rework costs or other damages related to such\nclaims. Furthermore, such claims by clients could damage the Company’s business reputation and result in the\ndiscontinuation of client relationships.\nAcquisitions May Not Succeed\nThe Company reviews prospective acquisitions as an element of its growth strategy. The failure of any acquisition\nto meet the Company’s expectations, whether due to a failure to successfully integrate any future acquisition or\notherwise, may result in damage to the Company’s financial performance and/or divert management’s attention from\nits core operations or could negatively affect the Company’s ability to meet the needs of its customers promptly.\nInternational Operations\nThe Company operates its business in Canada and, to a less significant extent, in Germany, Puerto Rico and Serbia.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, approximately 6.3% of the Company’s revenue were generated\noutside the United States. There are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including: the\nimposition of trade barriers, foreign exchange restrictions, longer payment cycles, greater difficulties in accounts\nreceivables collection, difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws (including without limitation the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act), changes in legal or regulatory requirements, difficulties in staffing and managing\nforeign operations, complex and uncertain employment environments, political instability and potentially adverse\ntax consequences. Our operations in Serbia could be adversely affected by the current conflict between Ukraine and\nRussia, with which Serbia has substantial ties. Should sanctions against Russia affect Russia in a way that causes\nadverse economic consequences to Serbia, or if such sanctions were to be extended to countries that might be\nconsidered to be in alignment with Russia, this could have a negative impact on our employees or operations both\nwithin and outside Serbia. To the extent the Company experiences these risks, the business and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nGlobal Epidemics\nAs was the case with the COVID-19 pandemic and endemic, and associated initiatives to reduce its spread, any\nother global pandemics or endemics that may occur in the future could adversely affect the Company’s business and\nfinancial position. For example, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of a\nhighly transmissible disease, such as closures of schools, businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of\nsocial distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions could\nadversely affect demand for our services and present challenges to us in delivering these services. These impacts on\nour business could have an adverse effect on our liquidity position and access to capital, including our ability to\naccess our line of credit.\n18\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nGlobal Epidemics (Continued)\nThese factors, in addition to delays in payment, could continue result in significant bad debts in the near future.\nAdditionally, our operating results would be adversely affected if unexpected increases in the costs of labor and\nlabor related costs, materials, supplies and equipment used in performing services could not be passed on to our\nclients. In addition, we believe that to maintain or improve our financial performance we must continue to obtain\nservice agreements with new clients, retain and provide new services to existing clients, achieve modest price\nincreases on current service agreements with existing clients and/or maintain internal cost reduction strategies at our\nvarious operational levels. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to sustain the internal development of managerial\npersonnel is an important factor impacting future operating results and the successful execution of our projected\ngrowth strategies. A future pandemic could make these objective more difficult to attain.\nTrademarks\nManagement believes the RCM Technologies, Inc. name is extremely valuable and important to its business. The\nCompany endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights and maintain certain trademarks, trade names, service\nmarks and other intellectual property rights, including The Source of Smart Solutions® and Industries of Tomorrow,\nToday™ with a trademark application submitted for the use of the latter. The Company is not currently aware of\nany infringing uses or other conditions that would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the\nCompany’s use of its proprietary rights. The Company’s success depends on its ability to successfully obtain and\nmaintain, and prevent misappropriation or infringement of, its intellectual property, maintain trade secret protection,\nand conduct operations without violating or infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Intellectual\nproperty litigation is expensive and time-consuming, and it is often difficult, if not impossible, to predict the\noutcome of such litigation. If the Company is involved in intellectual property litigation, its business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nData Center Capacity and Telecommunication Links\nUninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), card key access, fire suppression, and environmental control systems protect\nthe Company’s datacenter. All systems are monitored on a 24/7 basis with alerting capabilities via voice or email.\nThe telecommunications architecture at the Company utilizes managed private circuits from AT&T, which\nencompasses provisioning redundancy and diversity.\nThe Company’s ability to protect its data center against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure\nand other disasters is critical to business operations. In order to provide many of its services, the Company must be\nable to store, retrieve, process and manage large databases and periodically expand and upgrade its capabilities.\nAny damage to the Company’s data centers or any failure of the Company’s telecommunication links that interrupts\nits operations or results in an inadvertent loss of data could adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet its\ncustomers’ needs and their confidence in utilizing the Company for future services.\nThe Company’s ability to protect its data, provide services and safeguard its installations, as it relates to the IT\ninfrastructure, is in part dependent on several outside vendors with whom the Company maintains service level\nagreements.\n19\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nCyber Security\nWe are highly dependent on information technology systems to operate our business. A breakdown, invasion,\ncorruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems by employees, others with\nauthorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. In the ordinary course\nof business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner\nto maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Additionally, we outsource certain elements of our\ninformation technology systems to third parties. As a result of this outsourcing, our third party vendors may or\ncould have access to our confidential information making such systems vulnerable. Data breaches of our\ninformation technology systems, or those of our third party vendors, may pose a risk that sensitive data may be\nexposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security\nmeasures to protect our data and information technology systems and have been informed by our third party vendors\nthat they have as well, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our\nsystems, or those of our third party vendors, that could adversely affect our business.\nEnvironmental Matters and Climate Change\nThe Company and many of its customers are subject to regulation by federal, state and international environmental\nlaws, including those relating to climate change, that are subject to rapid change, which could result in regulatory\nuncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs. There can be no assurance that the steps\nwe take to abide by applicable requirements will meet all current and future regulatory. Any failures to do so could\nresult in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, or other liabilities, that could adversely affect\nour business.\nData Privacy\nWe control, process, or have access to personal information regarding our own employees or employment\ncandidates, as well as that of many of our customers or other third parties. Information concerning these individuals\nmay also reside in systems controlled by third party vendors with whom we do business. The legal and regulatory\nenvironment concerning data privacy is becoming more complex and challenging, and the potential consequences of\nnon-compliance have become more severe. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and similar laws\nimpose additional compliance requirements related to the collection, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and\nretention of personal information, which can increase operating costs and resources to accomplish. Any failure to\nabide by these regulations or to protect such personal information from inappropriate access or disclosure, whether\nthrough social engineering or by accident or other cause, could have severe consequences including fines, litigation,\nregulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and loss of customers or employees. There can be no assurance that the\nsteps we take to abide by applicable requirements and protect information will meet all current and future regulatory\nrequirements, anticipate all potential methods of unauthorized access, or prevent all inappropriate disclosures. Any\nfailures to do so could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, or other liabilities, that\ncould adversely affect our business.\n20\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nThe Company has developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of its critical systems and information. The Company’s cybersecurity risk\nmanagement program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan and is integrated with the Company’s overall\nenterprise risk management program, sharing common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes\nthat apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational and\nfinancial risk areas. While the Company may not meet any particular standard, specification or requirement of the\nCenter for Internet Security Critical Security Controls, the Company utilizes such controls as a guide to help\nidentify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to the business. The Company has implemented\ncybersecurity policies and frameworks based on industry and governmental standards to align closely with\nrequirements, instructions, and guidance from ISO27001, NIST, CMMC, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC and SOX\nCompliance.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes, among other things:\n risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to critical systems and information\nservices;\n a team comprising information technology (IT) security, IT infrastructure, and IT compliance personnel\nprincipally responsible for directing (i) cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (ii) security processes and\n(iii) planned responses to cybersecurity incidents;\n the use of external cybersecurity service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist\nwith aspects of security processes;\n cybersecurity awareness training of employees with access to IT systems;\n a cybersecurity incident response plan and Security Operations Center to respond to cybersecurity\nincidents; and\n a third-party risk management process for service providers.\nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, the Company has not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats,\nincluding as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected operations, business strategy,\nresults of operations or financial condition. However, the Company expects to continue to face certain risks from\nongoing cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our\noperations, business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. See Risk Factors – Cyber Security, Data\nPrivacy and Data Center Capacity and Telecommunication Links.\n21\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY (CONTINUED)\nCybersecurity Governance\nThe Company’s Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and considers cybersecurity\nand IT risks as key strategic risks of the Company. The Board oversees management’s implementation of the\nCompany’s cybersecurity risk management program, receiving at least annual updates from management (including\nour Chief Information Officer) on cybersecurity risks, including briefings on the Company’s cyber risk management\nprogram and cybersecurity incidents, and reviewing cybersecurity topics impacting companies with management\nand external experts.\nThe Company’s Chief Information Officer leads the IT and cybersecurity functions and has primary responsibility\nfor leading the Company’s overall cybersecurity risk management program, supervising both internal cybersecurity\npersonnel and external cybersecurity service providers. The Company’s cybersecurity function is responsible for\nassessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, as well as informing management about and\nmonitoring the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity risks and incidents through\nvarious means, which include briefings with internal security personnel, threat intelligence and other information\nobtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external cybersecurity service providers and alerts\nand reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.\nThe Company’s Chief Information Officer and Vice President of IT security and Compliance have significant\nexperience in managing and leading information systems and deploying cybersecurity technologies and have\nextensive cybersecurity training and knowledge. The Company’s Vice President of IT security and Compliance has\nseveral industry certifications, including CISSP (Certified Information Security System Professional), CCSP\n(Certified Cloud Security Professional) and CCSK (Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge). The Company’s\nChief Information Officer reports to the Chief Executive Officer, and the Company’s Vice President of IT Security\nand Compliance reports to the Company’s Chief Information Officer.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Company provides specialty professional consulting services, principally performed at various client locations,\nthrough 29 administrative and sales offices located in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Germany and Serbia.\nThe majority of the Company’s offices typically consist of 1,000 to 15,000 square feet and are typically leased by\nthe Company for terms of one to five years. Offices in larger or smaller markets may vary in size from the typical\noffice. The Company does not expect that it will be difficult to maintain or find suitable lease space at reasonable\nrates in its markets or in areas where the Company contemplates expansion.\nThe Company’s executive office is located at 2500 McClellan Avenue, Suite 350, Pennsauken, New Jersey 08109-\n4613. These premises consist of approximately 3,500 square feet and are leased at a rate of approximately $15.00\nper square foot per annum for a term ending on November 30, 2025.\nThe Company’s operational office is located at 20 Waterview Boulevard, 4th Floor, Parsippany, NJ 07054-1271.\nThese premises consist of approximately 9,200 square feet and are leased at a rate of approximately $25.50 per\nsquare foot per annum for a term ending on April 30, 2024.\n22\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, the Company is a defendant in various legal actions that arise in the ordinary business course.\nThese matters may relate to professional liability, tax, compensation, contract, competitor disputes, and employee-\nrelated matters and include individual and class action lawsuits, as well as inquiries and investigations by\ngovernmental agencies regarding the Company’s employment and compensation practices. Additionally, some of\nthe Company’s clients may also become subject to claims, governmental inquiries and investigations, and legal\nactions relating to the Company’s professional services. Depending upon the particular facts and circumstances, the\nCompany may also be subject to indemnification obligations under its contracts with such clients relating to these\nmatters.\nAs such, the Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as\npotential ranges of losses and possible recoveries. The Company may not be covered by insurance as it pertains to\nsome or all of these matters. A determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments and\ncontingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each matter. The\nCompany records a liability when management believes an adverse outcome from a loss contingency is both\nprobable and the amount, or a range, can be reasonably estimated. From time to time, the Company must estimate\nthe potential loss even though the party adverse to the Company has not asserted any specific amounts. Significant\njudgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount. The Company reviews its\nloss contingencies at least quarterly and it adjusts its accruals and/or disclosures to reflect the impact of negotiations,\nsettlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, or other new information, as deemed necessary. Once established, a\nprovision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances. The Company could\nincrease or decrease its earnings in the period that the changes are made.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of December 30, 2023, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss has\nnot been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could result in\nan unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company believes that such\nmatters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 30, 2023, the Company has accrued $2.9\nmillion for asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the\nCompany is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not determined if it\nhas any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually limited to an amount\nno higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found liable, any damages would be\ncovered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum coverage of $5.0 million. While the\nCompany attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has reserved $0.5 million for this project.\nThe Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3 million or that liability over $0.5 million, if\nany, will be covered by insurance.\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n23\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER\nMATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nShares of the Company’s common stock are traded on The NASDAQ Global Market under the Symbol “RCMT.”\nHolders\nAs of February 20, 2024, the approximate number of holders of record of the Company’s Common Stock was 247\nand the number of beneficial owners of its Common Stock was approximately 7,650.\nDividends\nNo dividends were declared in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2023. All restricted share awards contain a dividend equivalent\nprovision entitling holders to dividends paid between the restricted stock award grant date and ultimate share\ndistribution date. As of December 30, 2023, there were no accrued dividends.\nWhile the Company, at this time, has no plans to issue any future dividends, any future payment of dividends will\ndepend upon, among other things, the Company’s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of\nindebtedness, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Revolving\nCredit Facility (as discussed in Item 7 hereof) prohibits the payment of any dividends or distributions on account of\nthe Company’s capital stock without the prior consent of the majority of the Company’s lenders.\nStock Repurchase by Issuer\nOn April 25, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of its common\nstock up to an amount not to exceed $25.0 million. This program succeeds the Company’s prior repurchase program\nauthorized in November 2021, which was substantially completed in April 2023. The program is designed to\nprovide the Company with enhanced flexibility over the long term to optimize its capital structure. Shares of the\nCommon Stock may be repurchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions. The program may be\nterminated or suspended at any time at the discretion of the Company. The Company may enter into a Rule 10b5-1\ntrading plan to effect a portion of the authorized purchases if the criteria set forth in the plan are met. Such a plan\nwould enable the Company to repurchase its shares during periods outside of its normal trading windows when the\nCompany typically would not be active in the market.\n24\nITEM 5.

RESERVED\n25\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements\nrelating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements\nshould be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses matters relating to the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between such fiscal years. Discussions of matters relating to the\nfiscal year ended January 1, 2022 and year-to-year comparison between that year and the year ended December 31,\n2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nOverview\nThe Company participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the\nimpact of economic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the\nCompany’s financial performance.\nThe Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven\nrecord of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to\noptimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong\nvertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.\nThe Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business\nprocesses to compete in today’s business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing\nbusiness and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses\ntoday are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact\non spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.\nNonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced life sciences,\ninformation technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they\ncan maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage.\nAlthough working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support\nincreasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a\ndemand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate\nthe potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.\nThe Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon\nfixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management\nand solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally\nendeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also\nrealizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical\nconsultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily\nprovided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company’s consultants based upon their\nskill level, experience and the type of work performed.\n26\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview (Continued)\nThe majority of the Company’s services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the\nmore complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the\nnature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more\ncomplex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally\nterminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days’ notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically, these contracts are for less than one year. The\nCompany recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.\nCosts of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and\nemployees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses\nconsist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating\nactivities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries\nand benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company’s corporate marketing,\nadministrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these\nexpenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the\npurpose of segment financial reporting.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity\nwith U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our consolidated financial statements, estimates are\nused for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-lived intangible\nassets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock awards, insurance liabilities, accounting for income taxes\nand accrued bonuses.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring\nservices promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive\nin exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate service\nstreams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the\ncontract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction\nprice; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize revenue when (or as)\neach performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company’s Engineering Services and Life Sciences\nand Information Technology segments perform consulting and project solution services. The Healthcare segment\nspecializes in long-term and short-term staffing and placement services to hospitals, schools and long-term care\nfacilities amongst others. All of the Company’s segments perform staff augmentation services and derive revenue\nfrom permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company’s revenue is invoiced on a time and materials basis.\n27\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue source for the fiscal years ended December 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022:\nDecember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\nSpecialty Health Care:\nTime and Material $134,941 $158,001\nPermanent Placement Services 1,300 1,447\nTotal Specialty Health Care $136,241 $159,448\nEngineering:\nTime and Material $42,443 $44,915\nFixed Fee 42,232 41,021\nPermanent Placement Services - 1\nTotal Engineering $84,675 $85,937\nLife Sciences and Information Technology:\nTime and Material $35,368 $35,473\nFixed Fee 6,551 3,022\nPermanent Placement Services 402 800\nTotal Life Sciences and Information Technology $42,321 $39,295\n$263,237 $284,680\nTime and Material\nThe Company’s Health Care segment predominantly recognizes revenue through time and material work while its\nEngineering and Life Sciences and Information Technology segments recognize revenue through both time and\nmaterial and fixed fee work. The Company’s time and material contracts are typically based on the number of hours\nworked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials contracts are\nrecognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed Fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts requiring\nthe completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of its customers\nthat broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements are typically\ndelivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that fixed fee project.\nWhile these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company’s fixed fee purchase orders are\ntypically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are provided on a fixed-\nprice basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain instances, revenue is\ninvoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue under these arrangements\nare recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. From time-to-time, amounts paid in excess of revenue\nearned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, some contracts contain “Performance Fees” (bonuses) for\ncompleting a contract under budget. Performance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit\nrevenue and billings to specified maximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period\nsuch losses are determined. For contracts where there is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the\nrevenue is not recognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed\nwhen the related revenue is recognized.\n28\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are\ntypically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company’s client. The\nCompany guarantees its permanent placements on a prorated basis for 90 days. In the event a candidate is not\nretained for the 90-day period, the Company will provide a suitable replacement candidate. In the event a\nreplacement candidate cannot be located, the Company will provide a prorated refund to the client. An allowance\nfor refunds, based upon the Company’s historical experience, is recorded in the financial statements.\nDeferred Revenue\nThere was $1.9 million of deferred revenue as of December 30, 2023. Deferred revenue was $1.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be\nrecognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet, although this is an\ninfrequent occurrence. In the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company\nrecognized revenue of $1.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the\nbeginning of the reporting period.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on evaluation\nof customers’ financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary\nand are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nAccounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its\nallowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due,\nthe Company’s previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the\ncondition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when\nthey become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables previously written off are\ncredited to bad debt expense.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350\n“Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment” (“ASC Topic 350”).\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the Company’s fiscal December\neach year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill\nmay be below its carrying amount. The Company has three reporting units. The Company uses a market-based\napproach to determine the fair value of the reporting units. This approach uses earnings/revenue multiples of similar\ncompanies recently completing acquisitions and the ability of our reporting units to generate cash flows as measures\nof fair value of our reporting units. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04,\n“Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” effective December\n29, 2018 which has eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should\nperform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.\nThere was no goodwill impairment in fiscal 2023 or 2022. During all periods presented, the Company determined\nthat the existing qualitative factors did not suggest that an impairment of goodwill exists. There can be no assurance\nthat future indicators of impairment and tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges for both\nits Engineering and Specialty Healthcare segments.\n29\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the\nCompany determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an\nasset’s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any, are\nreported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nAccounting for Restricted Stock Awards\nThe Company uses restricted stock awards to attract, retain and reward employees for long-term service. The\nCompany follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic\n718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation” which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock-based\npayment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. This compensation cost is measured based on the\nfair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost using\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock at the\ndate of grant for restricted stock awards.\nInsurance Liabilities\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care insurance.\nThe Company establishes loss provisions based on historical experience and in the case of expected losses from\nworkers compensation, considers input from third parties. The amounts included in the Company’s costs related to\nthis risk participation are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions, the Company’s claims\nexperience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn establishing the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities and valuation\nallowances against deferred tax assets, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax\nlaws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had both\ndomestic and foreign net deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 million. The domestic long term net deferred tax liability of\n$1.6 million includes $4.3 million in deferred liabilities offset by $2.7 million in deferred tax assets. The deferred\ntax liabilities consist of acquisition amortization of $1.8 million, prepaid expenses of $1.0 million, advance\ndepreciation deductions of $0.7 million and right of use assets of $0.7 million. The domestic deferred tax assets\nconsist of lease liabilities of $0.8 million, reserves and accruals of $0.8 million, compensation of $0.7 million and\nallowance for doubtful accounts of $0.4 million. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the\nlikelihood that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize these benefits over time, and the effectiveness of\ntax planning strategies in the relevant tax jurisdictions. If actual results differ from these estimates and assessments,\nvaluation allowances may be required. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had $0.1 million in foreign net\ndeferred tax liabilities associated with its Canadian operations and a small deferred tax asset associated with its\nGerman operations.\nThe Company conducts its operations in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Germany, Puerto\nRico and Serbia. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated United States Federal income tax return and\nfile in various states. The Company has no open Federal audits as of December 30, 2023. Except for limited\nexceptions, the Company is no longer subject to audits by state and local tax authorities for tax years prior to 2019.\nThe Company is no longer subject to audit in Canada for the tax years prior to tax year 2019. The Company is no\nlonger subject to audit in Puerto Rico for the tax years prior to tax year 2018.\nThe Company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax\nassets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company is subject to the\nexamination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company\nregularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy\nof its provision for income taxes.\n30\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nAccrued Bonuses\nThe Company pays bonuses to certain executive management, field management and corporate employees based on,\nor after giving consideration to, a variety of financial performance measures. Bonuses for executive management,\nfield management and certain corporate employees are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first\nquarter of the following year, based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets. In addition,\nthe Company pays discretionary bonuses to certain employees, which are not related to budget performance.\nVariances in actual results versus budgeted amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore\non the estimates of the required accruals. Accordingly, the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from\nthe estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock and Stock Unit Awards\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock and stock unit awards to its executives.\nPerformance-based restricted stock and stock unit awards are typically vested based on certain multi-year\nperformance metrics as determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee. The Company will reassess\nat each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable and would begin recognizing\nadditional compensation cost if and when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The\nCompany will then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and\nrecognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later measurement\ndate the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock or stock unit awards deemed as likely to vest\nare deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed. These performance-based restricted stock\nand stock unit awards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the\nCompany during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period on any stock and stock unit\nawards that actually vest, if any. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included\nin accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Dividends for\nperformance-based restricted stock and stock unit awards that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nForward-looking Information\nThe Company’s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending\nprograms, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering, life sciences\nand information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company’s\noperating performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, global events such as international conflicts or\nhealth pandemics and endemics also have a substantial impact on our operations and financial results. The\nCompany believes that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service\nofferings provides some insulation from adverse trends. However, general economic declines could result in the\nneed for future cost reductions or changes in strategy.\nAdditionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of\nemployment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with\nrespect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. There can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a\nsufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.\nThe consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company\ncompetes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company’s service\nlines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors\nand customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future,\nwhich could limit the Company’s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.\n31\nITEM 7.

The\nfiscal years ended December 30, 2023 (fiscal 2023) and December 31, 2022 (fiscal 2022) consisted of fifty-two\nweeks each.\nRevenue. Revenue decreased 7.5%, or $21.4 million, for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 as compared to\nDecember 31, 2022 (the “comparable prior year period”). Revenue decreased $23.2 million in the Specialty Health\nCare segment, decreased $1.2 million in the Engineering segment and increased $3.0 million in the Life Sciences\nand Information Technology segment. See Segment Discussion for further information on revenue changes.\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services decreased 7.5%, or $15.2 million, for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 30, 2023 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Cost of services decreased primarily due to the\ndecrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and\nthe comparable prior year period was 70.9%. See Segment Discussion for further information regarding changes in\ncost of services and gross profit.\n32\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year Ended December 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022 (Continued)\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses were $52.2 million\nfor the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 as compared to $53.4 million for the comparable prior year period. As\na percentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 19.8% for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 and 18.8% for the\ncomparable prior year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\nGain on sale of assets. On July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its\nPickering and Kincardine offices, located in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often referred to as Canada\nPower Systems and principally provided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The\ntwo Canada Power Systems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company’s Engineering segment. For\nthe fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a gain of $0.4 and $0.2\nmillion, respectively, which was due to receiving escrow funds associated with the sale of Canada Power Systems in\nfiscal 2021.\nRemeasurement of acquisition related contingent consideration. The Company adjusted the forecasted\ncontingent consideration for active acquisition agreements, which created a discreet gain of $0.1 million for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There was no remeasurement in the current fiscal year ended December 30,\n2023.\nOther Expense, Net. Other expense, net consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on\nthe Company’s line of credit, net of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other\nexpense, net increased by $1.1 million as compared to the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase\nin interest expense, net. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowing. Borrowings increased primarily to\nfund treasury stock purchases.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company recognized $5.4 million of income tax expense for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 30, 2023, as compared to $7.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective\nincome tax rate for the current period was 24.2% as compared to 26.7% for the comparable prior-year period. The\neffective fiscal 2023 income tax rates as of December 30, 2023, were approximately 24.5%, 23.9% and 10.5% in the\nUnited States, Canada, and Europe, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can\nmaterially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and\nEuropean pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The effective income tax rate can also be impacted by discrete\npermanent differences affecting any period presented. The primary reason for the decrease in the consolidated\neffective rate in the current period was due to a permanent tax difference associated with the tax deduction for equity\ngrants in the United States that vested during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the\neffect of state and local income taxes, and share-based compensation. The actual effective tax rate may vary in\nfuture years depending on the actual operating income earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of\ntax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-based awards.\n33\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year Ended December 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $136.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 decreased 14.6%, or\n$23.2 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue was driven by both the\nCompany’s school and non-school clients. Revenue from school clients for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023\nwas $103.0 million as compared to $114.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from non-school\nclients for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 was $33.2 million as compared to $45.2 million for the\ncomparable prior-year period. Revenue decreases were primarily due to decreased demand associated with COVID-\n19 transitioning from a high level of activity relating during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 to a lesser\nlevel of activity associated with the change of COVID-19 to an endemic during the fiscal year ended December 30,\n2023. The Specialty Health Care segment’s gross profit decreased by 16.6%, or $8.0 million, to $39.9 million for the\nfiscal year ended December 30, 2023, as compared to $47.9 million for the prior-year period. The decrease in gross\nprofit was primarily driven by the decrease in revenue. Gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended December 30,\n2023 decreased to 29.3% as compared to 30.0% for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit\nmargin was primarily due to a mix shift for certain lower margin services. Specialty Health Care experienced\noperating income of $13.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, as compared to $19.8 million for the\ncomparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the decrease in operating income was the decrease in gross\nprofit, offset by a decrease in SGA expense. SGA expense decreased by $1.7 million to $26.0 million, as compared\nto $27.7 million in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a decrease\nin expenses associated with lower revenue and a lower allocation of corporate SGA expenses.\nThe Company believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic helped to increase Specialty Health Care revenue\nand gross margin in the first half of fiscal 2022, which impact did not materially affect any portion of fiscal 2023.\nHowever, the Company also believes that the demand for its Healthcare services is greater than it had been before\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The Company believes that, except for seasonality, it is well positioned for growth in\nrevenue going forward.\n34\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year Ended December 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nEngineering\nEngineering revenue of $84.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 decreased by 1.5%, or $1.2\nmillion, compared to the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in revenue comprised the following: decreases\nin Aerospace revenue of $4.9 million and Industrial Processing revenue of $4.8 million, offset by an increase to\nEnergy Services revenue of $8.5 million. The decrease in Aerospace revenue was primarily due to a contract\nreduction for the Company’s major outsourcing client. The Company believes the decrease in Industrial Processing\nrevenue was primarily due to the irregular timing of large contracts with its Industrial Processing clients. Gross\nprofit decreased by 5.1%, or $1.1 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit decreased\nbecause of the decrease in revenue and a decrease in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin of 24.3% for the\ncurrent period decreased from 25.3% for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was\nprimarily due to lower utilization resulting from an increase in staff associated with lower revenue as the Company\nabsorbed fixed salaried costs over lower revenue. The Engineering segment experienced operating income of $3.5\nmillion for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, as compared to $4.3 million for the comparable prior-year\nperiod. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit, offset by a $0.3 million\ndecrease in SGA expense.\nLife Sciences and Information Technology\nLife Sciences and Information Technology revenue of $42.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023\nincreased by 7.7%, or $3.0 million, as compared to $39.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit\nof $16.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 increased 21.5%, or $2.9 million, as compared to\n$13.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was due to the increase in revenue\nand an increase in gross profit margin. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit margin for the\nfiscal year ended December 30, 2023 was 38.2% as compared to 33.9% for the comparable prior-year period. The\nCompany attributes the gross profit margin increase to a concerted effort to increase gross profit margin through its\nmanaged service offerings. The Life Sciences and Information Technology segment experienced operating income\nof $6.6 million as compared to $4.7 million for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in operating income\nwas primarily due to an increase in gross profit, offset by an increase to SGA expense. SGA expense increased to\n$9.2 million as compared to $8.5 million in the comparable prior-year period. The increase in SGA expense was\nprimarily due to the acquisition of TalentHerder in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and a higher allocation of\ncorporate SGA expenses.\n35\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nSupplemental Operating Results on a Non-GAAP Basis\nThe following non-GAAP measures, which adjust for the categories of expenses described below, are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures (“Adjusted operating\nincome”, “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted net income”, and “Adjusted diluted net earnings per share”)\nare useful information for investors, shareholders and other stakeholders of our company in gauging our results of\noperations on an ongoing basis and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance\nand period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are performance measures and\nnot liquidity measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net\nincome or operating income as indicators of performance. In addition, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA\ntakes into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash\nflows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the major captions from the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n($ in thousands):\nFiscal Years Ended\nDecember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $12,482 $28,283\nInvesting activities ($2,536 ) ($4,820 )\nFinancing activities ($3,855 ) ($23,127 )\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided $12.5 million of cash for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 as compared to\n$28.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The major components of cash used in or provided by operating\nactivities in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 and the comparable prior year period are as follows: net\nincome and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable,\nprepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs,\nand deferred revenue.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, the Company experienced net income of $16.8 million as compared to\n$20.9 million for the comparable prior year period. An increase in accounts receivables in the fiscal year ended\nDecember 30, 2023, used $20.6 million of cash as compared to $1.5 million in the comparable prior year period.\nThe Company primarily attributes this increase in accounts receivables for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023\nto normal fluctuations in accounts receivable relative to revenue.\nWhile highly variable, the Company’s transit accounts payable typically exceeds the Company’s transit accounts\nreceivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course\nof business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable of $22.2 million\nas of December 30, 2023 as compared to a net payable of $6.5 million as of December 31, 2022, providing $15.7\nmillion of cash during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. The increase to net transit payable as of December\n30, 2023 was due to several large, multiyear EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) projects starting in\nthe Company’s second fiscal quarter. In a typical EPC contract, the Company receives significant cash upfront to\nfund equipment procurement and construction subcontractors throughout the project.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets provided negligible cash for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 as\ncompared to using $2.4 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes changes to\nprepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of business.\nSince certain expenses are paid before a fiscal year concludes and are amortized over the next fiscal year, prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets generally tend to increase at the end of a fiscal year and decrease during the first\nthree quarters of the following fiscal year.\nA decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used cash of $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended December\n30, 2023 as compared to providing $4.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes these\nchanges to typical fluctuations in the normal course of business.\n38\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nOperating Activities (Continued)\nChanges in accrued payroll and related costs used $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 as\ncompared to negligible cash for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There are four primary factors that\ngenerally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll\nand related costs is the Company’s largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other\nfactors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two\nweeks and normally has thirty-nine weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major\npayroll on the last business day of every other quarter; 3) the timing of various payroll related payments varies in the\nnormal course of business; and 4) most of the Company’s senior management participate in annual incentive plans\nand while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent\nthey are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive\nplan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The\nCompany’s last major payroll for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 was paid on December 29, 2023.\nHistorically, the Company has experienced small deferred revenue balances. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany’s Industrial Processing group secured several contracts with significant front-loaded payments, thereby\ngenerating larger deferred revenue balances than typically generated. As a result, the Company’s deferred revenue\nbalance as of December 30, 2023 was $0.3 million, compared to $1.1 million as of December 31, 2022, using cash\nfrom operations of $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. While the Company expects to\nreceive future upfront payments from its Industrial Processing clients, the Company cannot reasonably forecast\ndeferred revenue balances as the timing of contract wins and front-loaded payments are typically irregular.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $2.5 million of cash for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 and $4.8 million for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Investing activities used $2.9 million for the purchase of property and\nequipment in the current period as compared to $0.9 million in the prior year comparable period. The fiscal years\nended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 both included discrete gains associated with the Company’s sale\nof its Canada Power Systems business unit. The prior year period used $4.2 million for the acquisition of\nTalentHerder.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities used $3.9 million of cash for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 and $23.1 million for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The Company made net borrowings under its line of credit of $22.0 million\nduring the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 as compared to net payments of $5.4 million in the comparable\nprior year period. The Company used $25.8 million to repurchase shares of its common stock in the current period\nas compared to $17.6 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company generated cash of $0.7 million and\n$0.4 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and the comparable prior year period,\nrespectively. The Company paid contingent consideration of $0.3 million in the current period as compared to $0.1\nmillion in the comparable prior year period.\n39\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate),\nplus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed\nin fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The\nCompany also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused\nline fees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees,\nfor the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were 6.5% and 2.2%, respectively. However,\nduring the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, it experienced a weighted average interest rate of 6.8%,\nincluding unused line. The Company believes its fourth quarter interest rate is more reflective of rates expected in\nthe near term.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various\nfinancial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order to\npay dividends. As of December 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the\nRevolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants for\nthe foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $30.9 million and $8.8\nmillion, respectively. At December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were letters of credit outstanding for $2.0\nand $1.9 million, respectively. At December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had availability for\nadditional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $12.1 million and $34.3 million, respectively.\nIn addition to borrowings and sales of shares from its equity plans, the Company may raise capital through sales of\nshares of common stock under its at-the-market issuance program (the “ATM Program”) established under its May\n2021 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., as the agent (the “Agent”). The ATM\nProgram allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to\n$25.0 million from time to time through the Agent. To date, the Company has not sold any shares under the ATM\nProgram.\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations,\nand meet the other general cash needs of our business. Our liquidity is impacted by general economic, financial,\ncompetitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to\npay our expenses, principally labor costs, and other related expenditures. We generally satisfy our liquidity needs\nthrough cash provided by operations and, when necessary, our revolving line of credit from Citizens Bank. The\nCompany believes it has a great deal of flexibility to reduce its costs if it becomes necessary. The Company believes\nthat it can satisfy its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months.\nThe Company’s liquidity and capital resources as of December 30, 2023, included accounts receivable and total\ncurrent asset balances of $70.7 million and $90.5 million, respectively. Current liabilities were $58.2 million as of\nDecember 30, 2023 and were exceeded by total current assets by $32.3 million.\n40\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility (Continued)\nThe Company experiences volatility in its daily cash flow and, at times, relies on the revolving line of credit to\nprovide daily liquidity for the Company’s financial operations. As of December 30, 2023, the Company was in\ncompliance with all financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it\nwill maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nDividends\nAll restricted share awards contain a dividend equivalent provision entitling holders to dividends paid between the\nrestricted stock award grant date and ultimate share distribution date. As of December 30, 2023, there were no\naccrued dividends.\nWhile the Company, at this time, has no plans to issue any future dividends, any future payment of dividends will\ndepend upon, among other things, the Company’s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of\nindebtedness, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Revolving\nCredit Facility (as discussed above) prohibits the payment of any dividends or distributions on account of the\nCompany’s capital stock without the prior consent of the majority of the Company’s lenders.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes. Funding\nfor any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from one or more of\nthe Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or future financing\ntransactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course\nof its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists\nthe possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the results of operations.\nThe Company’s business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through\nstrategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates.\nThe Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally\nincluded significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase\nhowever, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such\nopportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No\nassurance can be given as to the Company’s future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such\nopportunities will be financed.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of December 30, 2023, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss has\nnot been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could result in\nan unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company believes that such\nmatters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 30, 2023, the Company has accrued $2.9\nmillion for asserted claims.\n41\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCommitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the\nCompany is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not determined if it\nhas any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually limited to an amount\nno higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found liable, any damages would be\ncovered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum coverage of $5.0 million. While the\nCompany attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has reserved $0.5 million for this project.\nThe Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3 million or that liability over $0.5 million, if\nany, will be covered by insurance.\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\nThe Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in\n1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company is currently\nimplementing an upgrade of its current system and expects to go live in 2024. The Company estimates this upgrade\nor replacement of its financial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\nThese estimates are subject to material change.\nThe Company’s current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes\nthat its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of\nbusiness for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates\nthrough October 2029. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nOperating Finance\nFiscal Year Leases Leases\n2024 $771 $233\n2025 506 -\n2026 409 -\n2027 302 -\n2028 144 -\nThereafter 1,311 -\nTotal lease payments $3,443 $233\nLess: imputed interest (482 ) -\nTotal $2,961 $233\n42\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of December 30, 2023, the Company had two acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets of\nThermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC, and 2) effective October 2, 2022, the\nCompany acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates future contingent payments at\nDecember 30, 2023 as follows:\nFiscal Years Ending Total\nThe four quarters following December 30, 2023 $300\nThereafter 1,671\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $1,971\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of December 30, 2023. Contingent\nconsideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other\n(expense) income, net.\nSignificant employment agreements are as follows:\nExecutive Severance Agreements\nThe Company is a party to an Executive Severance Agreement (the “Executive Severance Agreement”) with each of\nBradley S. Vizi, the Company's Executive Chairman and President (dated as of June 1, 2018), and Kevin D. Miller,\nthe Company’s Chief Financial Officer (dated as of February 28, 2014, as amended), which set forth the terms and\nconditions of certain payments to be made by the Company to the executive in the event, while employed by the\nCompany, such executive experiences (a) a termination of employment unrelated to a “Change in Control” (as\ndefined therein) or (b) there occurs a Change in Control and either (i) the executive’s employment is terminated for a\nreason related to the Change in Control or (ii) in the case of Mr. Miller, the executive remains continuously\nemployed with the Company for a period of three months following the Change in Control.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if either (a) the executive is involuntarily terminated by the\nCompany for any reason other than “Cause” (as defined therein), “Disability” (as defined therein) or death, or (b)\nthe executive resigns for “Good Reason” (as defined therein), and, in each case, the termination is not a\n“Termination Related to a Change in Control” (as defined below), the executive will receive the following severance\npayments: (i) an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of (a) the executive’s annual base salary as in effect immediately\nprior to the termination date (before taking into account any reduction that constitutes Good Reason) (“Annual Base\nSalary”) and (b) the highest annual bonus paid to the executive in any of the three fiscal years immediately\npreceding the executive’s termination date (“Bonus”), to be paid in installments over the twelve month period\nfollowing the executive’s termination date; and (ii) for a period of eighteen months following the executive’s\ntermination date, a monthly payment equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the executive is required to pay to\ncontinue medical, vision, and dental coverage, for himself and, where applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents.\nNotwithstanding the above, if the executive has a termination as described above and can reasonably demonstrate\nthat such termination would constitute a Termination Related to a Change in Control, and a Change in Control\noccurs within 120 days following the executive’s termination date, the executive will be entitled to receive the\npayments set forth below for a Termination Related to a Change in Control, less any amounts already paid to the\nexecutive, upon consummation of the Change in Control.\n43\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments (Continued)\nExecutive Severance Agreements (Continued)\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if a Change in Control occurs and (a) the executive\nexperiences a Termination Related to a Change in Control on account of (i) an involuntary termination by the\nCompany for any reason other than Cause, death, or Disability, (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company\nwithin a specified period of time following a Change in Control (12 months for Mr. Vizi and three months for Mr.\nMiller) on account of Disability or death, or (iii) a resignation by the executive with Good Reason; or (b) in the case\nof Mr. Miller, the executive resigns, with or without Good Reason, which results in a termination date that is the last\nday of the three month period following the Change in Control, then the executive will receive the following\nseverance payments: (1) a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of the executive’s (a) Annual Base Salary\nand (b) Bonus; and (2) a lump sum payment equal to 24 multiplied by the monthly COBRA premium cost, as in\neffect immediately prior to the executive’s termination date, for the executive to continue medical, dental and vision\ncoverage, as applicable, in such Company plans for himself and, if applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents.\nUpon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall establish an irrevocable rabbi trust and contribute to\nthe rabbi trust the applicable amounts due under the Executive Severance Agreement. If Mr. Miller receives the\nChange in Control Payment following his resignation at the end of the three month period following the Change in\nControl, he will not be eligible to receive any severance payments under his Executive Severance Agreement.\nMr. Miller’s Executive Severance Agreement provides that if Mr. Miller remains continuously employed for three\nmonths following a Change in Control and is employed by the Company on the last day of such specified period,\nMr. Miller will receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus\n(the “Change in Control Payment”). If Mr. Miller receives the Change in Control Payment, he will not be eligible to\nreceive any severance payments under his Executive Severance Agreement.\nMichael Saks, our Division President, Health Care Services, as well as several other members of the Company’s\nsenior management (not including Mr. Vizi and Mr. Miller), are covered by our Change in Control Plan for Selected\nExecutive Management (the “CIC Plan”).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nImpact of Inflation\nConsulting, staffing, and project services are generally priced based on mark-ups on prevailing rates of pay, and as a\nresult are able to generally maintain their relationship to direct labor costs. Permanent placement services are priced\nas a function of salary levels of the job candidates.\nThe Company’s business is labor intensive; therefore, the Company has a high exposure to increasing health care\nbenefit costs. The Company attempts to compensate for these escalating costs in its business cost models and\ncustomer pricing by passing along some of these increased health care benefit costs to its customers and employees,\nhowever, the Company has not been able to pass on all increases. The Company is continuing to review its options\nto further control these costs, which the Company does not believe are representative of general inflationary trends.\nOtherwise, inflation has not been a meaningful factor in the Company’s operations.\n44\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-\n13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses\nfor assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the FASB issued\nASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to SEC\nParagraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date\nRelated to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which amends the effective date of the\noriginal pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for the\nCompany for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. CECL estimates of\nexpected credit losses on trade receivables over their life will be required to be recorded at inception, based on\nhistorical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company adopted the\nstandard in its first quarter of 2023. There was no material impact on the results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects\nof Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This standard only applies to contracts and other transactions that\nreference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to\nreference rate reform. This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to accounting guidance\non contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease entities’ financial reporting burdens as the market transitions\nfrom the LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. In December 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the sunset date of Topic 848. This update defers the sunset date from December 31,\n2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December\n31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment reporting\n(Topic 280)”, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments require disclosure of significant segment expenses\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as well as other segment items, extend certain\nannual disclosures to interim periods, clarify the applicability to single reportable segment entities, permit more than\none measure of profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and require disclosure of the title and position\nof the CODM. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to\nall prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. We are currently evaluating\nthe provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures, which requires the annual financial statements to include consistent categories and greater\ndisaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU\n2023-09 is effective for the Company’s annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early\nadoption permitted, and should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. We are currently\nevaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on our disclosures.\n45\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment\nportfolio and debt instruments, which primarily consist of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company does not\nhave any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio. The Company places its investments in instruments that\nmeet high credit quality standards. The Company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation\nof its invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. As of December 30, 2023, the\nCompany’s investments consisted of cash and money market funds. The Company does not use interest rate\nderivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the Company’s variable-rate line of\ncredit balances during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, if the interest rate on the Company’s variable-rate\nline of credit (using an incremental borrowing rate) during the period had been 1.0% higher, the Company’s interest\nexpense on an annualized basis would have increased by $0.2 million. The Company does not expect any material\nloss with respect to its investment portfolio.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements, together with the report of the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm, begins on page F-1.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\n46\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated,\nas of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the \"Exchange Act\")). Based on our evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule(s)\n13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of December 31, 2023, because of the\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements\nwill not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company previously disclosed, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2022, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As previously stated in such annual\nreport, the Company did not design and maintain information technology controls relevant to preparing its financial\nstatements, specifically concerning (i) separation of duties to the SAP ERP and General Ledger. (ii) adequate\nrestriction of administrator-type access to SAP (iii) program change management controls, and (iv) user access\ncontrols that ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user access to financial applications,\nprograms, and data. As a result, the Company's related process-level IT-dependent manual and automated controls\nthat rely upon the affected ITGCs, or information coming from IT systems with affected ITGCs, were also deemed\nineffective.\nAs part of the December 31, 2022, assessment, management designed a remediation action plan to address the\ndeficiencies described above. This plan included: (i) investments to upgrade or replace existing systems that do not\nsupport an appropriate internal control framework; (ii) expand company resources to address identified issues; (iii)\nassess segregation of duties and implement an annual user access review, including role design and process\ntransformation to appropriately mitigate significant risks associated with conflicting responsibilities in financial\nsystems; (iv) install an IT Change Management process and (v) internal training of key employees and third-party\nproviders.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in addressing the material weakness noted above, as of December 31,\n2023, the Company has still not designed and maintained information technology controls relevant to preparing its\nfinancial statements, specifically concerning (i) separation of duties to the SAP ERP and General Ledger and (ii)\nuser access controls that ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user access to financial\napplications, programs, and data. As a result, there continues to be a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\nThis material weakness did not result in a misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements.\nHowever, the material weakness could result in a misstatement of substantially all account balances or disclosures\nthat would result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not\nbe prevented or detected. Notwithstanding the above-identified material weaknesses, management believes the\nconsolidated financial statements, as included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, present the\nCompany's financial condition and results of operations fairly, in all material respects.\n47\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (CONTINUED)\nPlanned Material Weakness Remediation Activities\nTo address these material weaknesses, we have commenced actions to formalize the Company's framework and\npolicies to maintain evidence in the operation of control procedures and improve our IT general controls.\nRemaining remediation efforts related to the above-identified material weaknesses include:\n Planned fiscal year 2024 upgrade of SAP to achieve the appropriate internal control framework\ninfrastructure;\n Expand the available resources at the Company with experience designing and implementing control\nactivities, including information technology general controls, through hiring and use of third-party\nconsultants and specialists;\n Assess segregation of duties within the GL and revenue system applications and implement an annual user\naccess review, including role design and process transformation to appropriately mitigate significant risks\nassociated with conflicting responsibilities in financial systems;\n Perform additional training to ensure a clear understanding of risk assessment, controls, and monitoring\nactivities related to automated processes, systems, and ITGCs related to financial reporting.\nWe will continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and take steps to\nremediate the known material weaknesses expeditiously. The implementation of these remediation efforts is in\nprogress, may require additional expenditures to implement, and will require validation and testing of the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles, and as a\nresult, the timing of when we will be able to remediate the material weaknesses fully is uncertain. We may also\nconclude that additional measures may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which may necessitate further implementation and evaluation time.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the material weaknesses and remediation efforts described above, there have been no changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that\noccurred during the quarter ended December 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n48\nITEM 9B.

Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that responds to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\nF-2\nRevenue Recognition – Fixed-Price Contracts\nDescription of the Matter\nAs disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generally recognizes revenue over time as\nperformance obligations are satisfied. For fixed price contracts, the Company generally measures its progress to\ncompletion using an input measure of total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred. Recognition of\nrevenue and profit over time as performance obligations are satisfied is highly judgmental as it required the Company to\nprepare estimates of total contract revenue and total contract costs, including costs to complete contracts that are in\nprocess. These estimates are dependent on a number of subjective factors and involve judgment as changes in these\nassumptions could have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized.\nAudit Response\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the timing\nof revenue recognition, including testing the internal controls over the proper accumulation of labor costs by contract as\nwell as the approval of monthly and weekly invoices for accuracy and completeness and reviewing key provisions and\ndeliverables within customer contracts. We evaluated management’s application of their revenue recognition policies in\nthe determination of revenue recognition conclusions. Our audit procedures included, among others, selecting a sample\nof revenue transactions and performing the following procedures: we reviewed the signed contract; we reviewed the\nrecorded timesheet data related to the selected invoices, which corroborated management's assessment towards the\ncompletion of the performance obligation; and we reviewed the signed contract related to the selected invoice, noting\neach task has an agreed upon unit price per contract and the unit price matched what was shown on the invoice. We also\ntested for proper revenue recognition cut off.\n/s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2022.\nRed Bank, New Jersey\nMarch 14, 2024\nPCAOB ID Number 100\nF-3\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nRCM Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited RCM Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 30, 2023, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because of the effect\nof the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has\nnot maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in\nmanagement’s assessment in section “Item 9A” Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nManagement has identified that the Company did not design and maintain information technology controls relevant to\npreparing its financial statements, specifically concerning (i) separation of duties to their SAP ERP and General Ledger\nand (ii) user access controls that ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user access to financial\napplications, programs, and data. As a result, the Company's related process-level IT-dependent manual and automated\ncontrols that rely upon the affected ITGCs, or information coming from IT systems with affected ITGCs, were also\ndeemed ineffective.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity and cash\nflows for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the related notes. This material\nweakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023\nconsolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report, dated March 14, 2024, on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, which expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nF-4\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC\nRed Bank, New Jersey\nMarch 14, 2024\nF-5\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nRCM Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of RCM Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the\n“Company\") as of January 1, 2022 and the related consolidated statement of operations, comprehensive income (loss),\nchanges in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended January 1, 2022, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 1, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the\nyear ended January 1, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business and Basis of Presentation\nRCM Technologies, Inc. (the “Company” or “RCM”) is a premier provider of business and technology\nsolutions designed to enhance and maximize the operational performance of its customers through the\nadaptation and deployment of advanced engineering, life sciences and information technology services.\nAdditionally, the Company provides specialty health care staffing services through its Specialty Health Care\nServices group. RCM’s offices are primarily located in major metropolitan centers throughout North America,\nwith additional offices in the Netherlands, Serbia and Germany.\nThe consolidated financial statements are comprised of the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers its holdings of highly liquid money-market instruments and certificates of deposit to be\ncash equivalents if the securities mature within 90 days from the date of acquisition. These investments are\ncarried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company has significant cash balances at financial\ninstitutions, which, throughout the year, regularly exceed the federally insured limit of $250. Any loss incurred\nor lack of access to uninsured funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company held $103, $79 and $21 of cash and cash equivalents in Canadian banks as of December 30,\n2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, which was held principally in Canadian dollars.\nThe Company held $638, $203 and $169 of cash and cash equivalents in Serbian banks as of December 30,\n2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, which was held in various currencies. The\nCompany held $54 of cash and cash equivalents in German banks as of December 30, 2023, which was held\nprimarily in Euros. The office in Germany was opened in April 2023. The Company held $4, $16 and $2 of\ncash and cash equivalents in Netherlands banks as of December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1,\n2022, respectively, which was held in various currencies.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s carrying value of financial instruments, consisting primarily of accounts receivable, transit accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, transit accounts payable and borrowings under line of credit\napproximates fair value due to their liquidity or their short-term nature and the line of credit’s variable interest rate.\nThe Company does not have derivative products in place to manage risks related to foreign currency fluctuations for\nits foreign operations or for interest rate changes.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on\nevaluation of customers’ financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable\npayment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an\nallowance for doubtful accounts. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of 2023. There was\nno material impact on the results of operation. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number\nof factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss\nhistory, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general\neconomy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become\nuncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables previously written off are credited to\nbad debt expense.\nF-12\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nUnbilled Accounts Receivable and Work-in-Process\nUnbilled receivables primarily represent revenue earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the\nbalance sheet ending date. Work-in-process primarily represents revenue earned under contracts which the\nCompany is contractually precluded from invoicing until future dates as project milestones are realized. The\nCompany follows Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers when recording revenue on unbilled accounts receivable and work-in-process. See Note 4 for\nfurther details.\nTransit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payable\nFrom time to time, the Company’s Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things,\nconstruction management and engineering services. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may\npurchase equipment on behalf of the Company’s customer or engage subcontractors to provide construction or\nother services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project value; and c) assumes no ownership or\nrisks of inventory. In such situations, the Company acts as an agent under the provisions of FASB ASC 606\n“Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and therefore recognizes revenue on a “net-basis.” The Company\nrecords revenue on a “net” basis on relevant engineering and construction management projects, which require\nsubcontractor/procurement costs or transit costs. In those situations, the Company charges the client a\nnegotiated fee, which is reported as net revenue when earned.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the\ncorresponding payment from the Company’s end-client is received. Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of\nthe subcontractor or staffing agency, the Company records this amount simultaneously as both a “transit\naccount receivable” and “transit account payable,” as the amount when paid to the Company is due to and\ngenerally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The Company typically does not pay a given transit\naccount payable until the related transit account receivable is collected. The Company is typically obligated to\npay the subcontractor or staffing agency whether or not the client pays the Company. The Company’s transit\naccounts payable generally exceeds the Company’s transit accounts receivable but absolute amounts and\nspreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and are depreciated\nor amortized on the straight-line method at rates calculated to provide for retirement of assets at the end of their\nestimated useful lives. Computer hardware and software, and furniture and office equipment are typically\ndepreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the\nasset or the lease term.\nF-13\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s intangible assets have been generated through acquisitions. The Company maintains\nresponsibility for valuing and determining the useful life of intangible assets. As a general rule, the Company\namortizes restricted covenants over four years and customer relationships over six years. However,\ncircumstances may dictate other amortization terms as determined by the Company and assisted by their third\nparty advisors.\nCanadian Sales Tax\nThe Company is required to charge and collect sales tax for all Canadian clients and remits invoiced sales tax\nmonthly to the Canadian taxing authorities whether collected or not. The Company does not collect the sales\ntax from its clients until they have paid their respective invoices. The Company includes uncollected Canadian\nsales tax invoiced to clients in its prepaid and other current assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with FASB ASC 350\n“Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.” The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the\nlast day of the Company’s fiscal December each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances\nchange indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. The Company has three\nreporting units. The Company uses a market-based approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units.\nThis approach uses earnings/revenue multiples of similar companies recently completing acquisitions and the\nability of our reporting units to generate cash flows as measures of fair value of our reporting units. The\nCompany adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic\n350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” effective December 30, 2017 which has eliminated Step 2\nfrom the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by\ncomparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. To satisfy the “Step 0 Test”, the Company\nreviewed industry and market conditions, reporting unit specific events as well as overall financial performance\nand found no impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge in fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December\n31, 2022 and January 1, 2022. There can be no assurance that future indicators of impairment and tests of\ngoodwill impairment will not result in an impairment charge.\nF-14\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When\nthe Company determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover\nan asset’s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any,\nare reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company’s intangible assets\nconsist of customer relationships and non-compete agreements.\nSoftware\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 350-40 “Accounting for Internal Use Software,” certain costs related to the\ndevelopment or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of\nthe software. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the\nCompany capitalized $1,947, $282 and $1,256, respectively, for software costs. The net balance after\naccumulated depreciation for all software costs capitalized as of December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and\nJanuary 1, 2022 was $2,325, $977 and $1,350, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws, published tax guidance, as well\nas estimates of future earnings. These judgments and interpretations affect the provision for income taxes,\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance. The Company evaluated the deferred tax assets\nand determined on the basis of objective factors that the net assets will be realized through future years’ taxable\nincome. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates and assessments, additional valuation\nallowances may be required. The Company did not have any valuation allowance as of December 30, 2023,\nDecember 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ACS 740 “Income Taxes” (FASB ASC 740)\nwhich requires an asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires\nassessment of the likelihood of realizing benefits associated with deferred tax assets for purposes of determining\nwhether a valuation allowance is needed for such deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are\nmeasured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the\nperiod that such tax rate changes are enacted. The Company measures its deferred tax assets and liabilities\nusing the tax rates that the Company believes will apply in the years in which the temporary differences are\nexpected to be recovered or paid. The Company and its wholly owned United States subsidiaries file a\nconsolidated federal income tax return. The Company also files tax returns in Canada, Germany, Puerto Rico\nand Serbia.\nThe Company also follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740 which prescribes a model for the recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and provides guidance on\nderecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure and transition. The Company’s policy is to\nrecord interest and penalty, if any, as interest expense.\nF-15\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring\nservices promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to\nreceive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate\nservice streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the\ncontract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the\ntransaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize\nrevenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company’s Engineering Services, Life Sciences\nand Information Technology segments perform consulting and project solution services. The Healthcare\nsegment specializes in long-term and short-term staffing and placement services to hospitals, schools and long-\nterm care facilities amongst others. All of the Company’s segments perform staff augmentation services and\nderive revenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company’s revenue is invoiced on a time\nand materials basis.\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue source for the fiscal years ended December\n30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022:\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nSpecialty Health Care:\nTime and Material $134,941 $158,001 $97,363\nPermanent Placement Services 1,300 1,447 1,132\nTotal Specialty Health Care $136,241 $159,448 $98,495\nEngineering:\nTime and Material $42,443 $44,915 $33,937\nFixed Fee 42,232 41,021 32,168\nPermanent Placement Services - 1 67\nTotal Engineering $84,675 $85,937 $66,172\nLife Sciences and Information Technology:\nTime and Material $35,368 $35,473 $37,181\nFixed Fee 6,551 3,022 1,390\nPermanent Placement Services 402 800 637\nTotal Life Sciences and Information Technology $42,321 $39,295 $39,208\n$263,237 $284,680 $203,875\nF-16\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nTime and Material\nThe Company’s Health Care segment predominantly recognizes revenue through time and material work while\nits Engineering and Life Sciences and Information Technology segments recognize revenue through both time\nand material and fixed fee work. The Company’s time and material contracts are typically based on the number\nof hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials\ncontracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed Fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company enters into contracts requiring\nthe completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of its\ncustomers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements are\ntypically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that fixed\nfee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company’s fixed fee\npurchase orders are typically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are\nprovided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain\ninstances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue\nunder these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. From time-to-time,\namounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, some\ncontracts contain “Performance Fees” (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget. Performance Fees, if\nany, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified maximum amounts.\nProvisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined. For contracts where\nthere is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the revenue is not recognized, the costs incurred\nare deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the related revenue is recognized.\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are\ntypically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company’s client. The\nCompany guarantees its permanent placements on a prorated basis for 90 days. In the event a candidate is not\nretained for the 90-day period, the Company will provide a suitable replacement candidate. In the event a\nreplacement candidate cannot be located, the Company will provide a prorated refund to the client. An\nallowance for refunds, based upon the Company’s historical experience, is recorded in the financial statements.\nPermanent placement revenue was $1.7 million, $2.2 million and $1.8 million for the fiscal years ended\nDecember 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively.\nThe deferred revenue balance as of December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 was $1.9\nmillion, $1.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Revenue is recognized when the service has been\nperformed. Deferred revenue may be recognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was\nrecorded on the balance sheet, although this is an infrequent occurrence. In fiscal years ended December 30,\n2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $1.1 million, $3.4 million\nand $0.4 million, respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period.\nF-17\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nTransit Receivables and Transit Payables\nFrom time to time, the Company’s Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things,\nconstruction management and engineering services. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may\npurchase equipment on behalf of the Company’s customer or engage subcontractors to provide construction or\nother services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project value; and c) assumes no ownership or\nrisks of inventory. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the\nsubcontractor until after the corresponding payment from the Company’s end-client is received. Upon invoicing\nthe end-client on behalf of the subcontractor or staffing agency, the Company records this amount\nsimultaneously as both a “transit account receivable” and “transit account payable,” as the amount when paid to\nthe Company is due to and generally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The Company typically does\nnot pay a given transit account payable until the related transit account receivable is collected. The Company is\ntypically obligated to pay the subcontractor or staffing agency whether or not the client pays the Company. The\nCompany’s transit accounts payable generally exceeds the Company’s transit accounts receivable but absolute\namounts and spreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The transit\naccounts receivable was $8.9 million and related transit accounts payable was $31.1 million, for a net payable\nof $22.2 million, as of December 30, 2023. The transit accounts receivable was $3.3 million and related transit\naccounts payable was $9.8 million, for a net payable of $6.5 million, as of December 31, 2022. The transit\naccounts receivable was $1.0 million and related transit accounts payable was $2.1 million, for a net payable of\n$1.1 million, as of January 1, 2022.\nConcentrations\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, the Company had two customers exceed 10% of consolidated\nrevenue, representing 17.1% and 10.1% of consolidated revenue, respectively. During the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company had two customers exceed 10% of consolidated revenue, representing 13.2%\nand 12.7% of consolidated revenue, respectively. During the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022, no client\naccounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue. All customers exceeding 10% of consolidated revenue\nduring the periods presented are included in the Company’s Specialty Health Care segment.\nThe Company’s five, ten and twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 39.1%, 50.4% and 62.7%,\nrespectively, of the Company’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. The Company’s five, ten\nand twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 43.0%, 53.7% and 67.0%, respectively, of the\nCompany’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s five, ten and twenty largest\ncustomers accounted for approximately 35.8%, 52.5% and 65.1%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue for\nthe fiscal year ended January 1, 2022.\nAs of December 30, 2023, two clients represented more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, net,\nrepresenting 21.2% and 14.7%, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, two clients represented more than 10%\nof the Company’s accounts receivable, net, representing 16.1% and 12.5%, respectively. As of January 1, 2022,\ntwo clients represented more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, net, representing 15.3% and\n14.2%.\nF-18\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company’s Canadian, Serbian and German subsidiaries is the local currency.\nAssets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at\nweighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Any translation adjustments are included in the\naccumulated other comprehensive income account in stockholders’ equity. Transactions executed in different\ncurrencies resulting in exchange adjustments are translated at spot rates and resulting foreign exchange\ntransaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income consists of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nPer Share Data\nBasic net income per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common\nshares plus dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common shares\nconsist of stock options and other stock-based awards under the Company’s stock compensation plans, when\ntheir impact is dilutive. Because of the Company’s capital structure, all reported earnings pertain to common\nshareholders and no other adjustments are necessary.\nShare - Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation over the vesting period of an award based on fair value at\nthe grant date determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Certain assumptions are used to\ndetermine the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant and require subjective judgment.\nBecause employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and\nbecause changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models may\nnot provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options. Management assesses the\nassumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock-based compensation when share-\nbased awards are granted. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time,\nwhich could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair\nvalue determination. If an employee leaves the firm before the vesting period has been met, those shares are\nforfeited and removed from the share – based compensation expense calculation. See Note 11 for additional\nshare-based compensation information.\nRestricted share and share unit awards are recognized at their fair value. The amount of compensation cost is\nmeasured on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument issued. The compensation cost of the restricted\nshare and share unit awards is recognized over the vesting period of the restricted share and share unit awards\non a straight-line basis. Restricted share and share unit awards typically include dividend accrual equivalents,\nwhich means that any dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period become due and payable after\nthe vesting period assuming the grantee’s restricted share or share unit award fully vests. Dividends for these\ngrants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheet. Dividends for restricted share and share unit awards that ultimately\ndo not vest are forfeited.\nF-19\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expense was $781, $925 and $914 for the fiscal\nyears ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company values its financial assets and liabilities based on the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In\norder to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy was\nestablished that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad\nlevels, which are described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for\nidentical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;\nquoted prices in inactive markets; or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are\nobservable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy\ngives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nIn determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs\nand minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk\nin its assessment of fair value.\nReclassification\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These\nclassifications had no effect on the previously reported results of operations.\n2. FISCAL YEAR\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31.\nThe fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 (fiscal 2023), December 31, 2022 (fiscal 2022) and January 1, 2022\n(fiscal 2021) consisted of fifty-two weeks each.\nF-20\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

USE OF ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe Company uses estimates to determine an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable,\nlitigation, medical claims, vacation, goodwill impairment, if any, equity compensation, the tax rate applied and\nthe valuation of certain assets and liability accounts. In addition, the Company reviews its estimated costs to\ncomplete a contract and adjusts those costs when necessary. These estimates can be significant to the operating\nresults and financial position of the Company. The estimates are based upon various factors including current\nand historical trends, as well as other pertinent industry and regulatory authority information. Management\nregularly evaluates this information to determine if it is necessary to update the basis for its estimates and to\nadjust for known changes.\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care\ninsurance. The amounts included in the Company’s costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can\nvary based on changes in assumptions, the Company’s claims experience or the providers included in the\nassociated insurance programs.\nThe Company can be affected by a variety of factors including uncertainty relating to the performance of the\ngeneral economy, competition, demand for the Company’s services, adverse litigation and claims and the\nhiring, training and retention of key employees.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s carrying value of financial instruments, consisting primarily of accounts receivable, transit accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, transit accounts payable and borrowings under line of credit\napproximates fair value due to their liquidity or their short-term nature and the line of credit’s variable interest rate.\nThe Company does not have derivative products in place to manage risks related to foreign currency fluctuations for\nits foreign operations or for interest rate changes.\nThe Company re-measures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period and any change in\nthe fair value from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, is recorded in earnings in\nthe accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nF-21\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, TRANSIT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND TRANSIT ACCOUNTS\nPAYABLE\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are comprised as follows:\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nBilled $51,111 $40,256 $37,396\nUnbilled 14,737 6,615 10,231\nWork-in-progress 6,442 4,991 1,810\nAllowance for sales discounts and doubtful accounts (1,600 ) (1,100 ) (1,197 )\nAccounts receivable, net $70,690 $50,762 $48,240\nUnbilled receivables primarily represent revenue earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the\nbalance sheet ending date. Work-in-progress primarily represents revenue earned under contracts which the\nCompany contractually invoices at future dates.\n5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment are comprised of the following:\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nComputers and systems $5,513 $4,077 $4,133\nEquipment and furniture 262 220 86\nLeasehold improvements 413 267 159\nLaboratory equipment 173 67 -\n6,360 4,630 4,378\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization 2,355 2,532 2,439\nProperty and equipment, net $4,005 $2,098 $1,939\nThe Company periodically writes off fully depreciated and amortized assets.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nThe purchase method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 805, “Business Combination,” was applied\nfor all acquisitions. This requires the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the tangible and identifiable\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition\nwith the excess cost accounted for as goodwill. Goodwill arising from the acquisitions is attributable to\nexpected sales synergies from combining the operations of the acquired business with those of the Company.\nTalentHerder Acquisition\nEffective October 2, 2022, the Company acquired the business operations of TalentHerder, LLC, a California\nlimited liability company. TalentHerder is a leading talent acquisition services company. TalentHerder’s\nbusiness bridges the gap between in-house and external recruiting, specializing in high-growth companies. It\nworks with clients to help identify and hire top-quality talent across all critical functions, enabling companies to\nscale teams quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively. TalentHerder’s proven recruitment processes can help\nscale both in-person and remote working environments for companies across the globe. The acquisition will\nbolster the Company’s existing capabilities by expanding its recruitment process outsourcing (\"RPO\") service\nfootprint, enhancing the Company's candidate sourcing reach, and enabling the Company's in-house recruiting\nteam to respond more rapidly to client needs.\nThe consideration and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:\nCash $4,150\nCommon stock of the Company 631\nContingent consideration, at fair value 1,927\nTotal consideration $6,708\nThe seller of TalentHerder is eligible to receive post-closing contingent consideration upon the business\nexceeding certain base levels of operating income, potentially earned over five years. The amount recorded for\nthe contingent consideration represents the acquisition date fair value of expected consideration to be paid based\non TalentHerder’s forecasted operating income during the five year period. Expected consideration was valued\nbased on different possible scenarios for projected operating income. Each case was assigned a probability\nwhich was used to calculate an estimate of the forecasted future payments. Then a discount rate was applied to\nthese forecasted future payments to determine the acquisition date fair value to be recorded. The preliminary\nestimated purchase price has been allocated as follows:\nProperty and equipment, net $5\nCustomer relationships 910\nGoodwill(a) 5,793\nTotal consideration $6,708\n(a) The goodwill is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years, except for the\nportion of contingent consideration which is deductible only when paid.\nF-23\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (CONTINUED)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company remeasured the value of its contingent consideration. The primary\ndriver for remeasuring the contingent consideration was the performance by TKE. This remeasurement led to a\n$1.7 million reduction to the contingent consideration liability relating to the TKE acquisition. TKE had high\nyearly performance targets to achieve earn-out consideration. Two factors primarily contributed to TKE not\nhitting its performance targets. The first was the COVID-19 pandemic which overlapped earn-out years two\nand three. TKE had numerous projects in its pipeline that were delayed or eliminated by prospective clients.\nThe second factor relates to a specific client in earn-out year three. This client was dissatisfied with the product\noutput, and TKE agreed to fix the equipment. The additional cost caused TKE to miss its earn-out target. Based\non these factors, the Company determined to amend its asset purchase agreement with TKE, whereby TKE\ncould receive maximum contingent consideration of $0.4 million in 2022 and $0.3 million in 2023. TKE earned\n$0.3 million in 2022, so the Company recorded a remeasurement of contingent consideration for $0.1 million in\n2022.\nPotential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after December 30, 2023 are capped\nat a cumulative maximum of $9.6 million. The Company paid contingent consideration of $0.3 million, $0.1\nmillion and $0.5 million during the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1,\n2022, respectively.\nThe changes in the liability for contingent consideration from acquisitions for the fiscal years ended December\n30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 are as follows:\nBalance as of January 2, 2021 $2,858\nContingent payments made (494 )\nChanges in fair value of contingent consideration 52\nRemeasurement of contingent consideration (1,713 )\nBalance as of January 1, 2022 $703\nContingent payments made (99 )\nRemeasurement of contingent consideration (88 )\nAcquisition of TalentHerder 1,926\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $2,442\nContingent payments - cash (339 )\nContingent payments - stock (132 )\nBalance as of December 30, 2023 $1,971\nF-24\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (CONTINUED)\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of December 30, 2023, the Company had two acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain\nassets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC, and 2) effective October 2,\n2022, the Company acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates future contingent\npayments at December 30, 2023 as follows:\nTotal\nThe four quarters following December 30, 2023 $300\nThereafter 1,671\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $1,971\nFor acquisitions that involve contingent consideration, the Company records a liability equal to the fair value of\nthe estimated contingent consideration obligation as of the acquisition date. The Company determines the\nacquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on the likelihood of paying the additional\nconsideration. The fair value is estimated using projected future operating results and the corresponding future\nearn-out payments that can be earned upon the achievement of specified operating objectives and financial\nresults by acquired companies using Level 3 inputs and the amounts are then discounted to present value. These\nliabilities are measured quarterly at fair value, and any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration\nliability is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. During the measurement period, which may\nbe up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\nperiod or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of December 30, 2023. Contingent\nconsideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in\nother (expense) income, net.\nDivestiture of Assets\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its Pickering and Kincardine\noffices in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often called Canada Power Systems and principally\nprovided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The two Canada Power\nSystems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company’s Engineering segment. The Company will\ncontinue to offer other engineering services in Canada and similar services in the United States. The Company\nevaluated this transaction under ASC 205-20, discontinued operations, and determined it did not meet the\nrequirements to be treated as such. The transaction netted a gain on sale of assets of $2.4 million for the year\nended January 1, 2022. The purchase agreement provided for a typical indemnity escrow held by an\nindependent escrow agent. The net proceeds released from the escrow account generated a gain on sale of\nassets of $0.4 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. For the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022, these two offices generated revenue of $4.9 million.\nF-25\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

GOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in\nbusiness combinations. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the\nCompany's fiscal year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value\nof goodwill may be below the carrying amount. The Company reviewed industry and market conditions,\nreporting unit specific events as well as overall financial performance and determined that no indicators of\nimpairment of goodwill existed during the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and\nJanuary 1, 2022. As such, no impairment loss on the Company’s goodwill during the fiscal years ended\nDecember 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 or January 1, 2022 was recorded as a result of such review.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022\nand January 1, 2022 are as follows:\nSpecialty Information\nEngineering Health Care Technology Total\nBalance as of January 2, 2021 $11,918 $2,398 $2,038 $16,354\nNo change in fiscal 2021 - - - -\nBalance as of January 1, 2022 $11,918 $2,398 $2,038 $16,354\nAcquisition of TalentHerder - - 5,793 5,793\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $11,918 $2,398 $7,831 $22,147\nNo change in fiscal 2023 - - - -\nBalance as of December 30, 2023 $11,918 $2,398 $7,831 $22,147\nF-26\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When\nthe Company determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover\nan asset’s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any,\nare reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company’s intangible assets\nconsist of customer relationships and non-compete agreements. During all periods presented, the Company\ndetermined that no impairment of intangible assets exists.\nAll of the Company’s intangible assets are associated with the Engineering segment. Intangible assets other\nthan goodwill are amortized over their useful lives. Intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated\namortization.\nDetails of intangible assets by class at December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022:\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nCustomer relationships $683 $864 $ -\nTotal intangible assets $683 $864 $ -\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022\nand January 1, 2022 was $182, $46 and $95, respectively.

LINE OF CREDIT\nOn April 24, 2023, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the “Fourth\nAmended and Restated Loan Agreement”) with Citizens Bank, N.A., as lender (in such capacity, the “Lender”)\nand as administrative agent and arranger (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), to amend and restate in\nits entirety that certain Third Amended and Restated Agreement dated as of the August 9, 2018 (as the same has\nbeen amended and modified prior to the date hereof, the “Existing Loan Agreement”).\nThe Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for a $45.0 million revolving credit facility (the\n“Revolving Credit Facility”), has no limitation for letters of credit, and expires on April 24, 2026.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing\nRate), plus applicable margin or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The\nCompany also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn.\nUnused line fees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including\nunused line fees, for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were\n6.5%, 2.2% and 2.0%, respectively.\nAll borrowings under the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement remain collateralized with\nsubstantially all of the Company’s assets, as well as the capital stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit\nFacility also contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the\nCompany’s ability to borrow in order to pay dividends. As of December 30, 2023, the Company was in\ncompliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will\nmaintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were\n$30.8 million, $8.8 million and $14.2 million, respectively. At December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and\nJanuary 1, 2022, there were letters of credit outstanding for $2.0 million, $1.9 million, and $1.9 million,\nrespectively. At December 30, 2023, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the\nRevolving Credit Facility of $12.1 million.\nF-28\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

PER SHARE DATA\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares outstanding used for\ndiluted earnings per share. The number of weighted-average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings\nper share for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 was\ndetermined as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 8,308,867 10,051,688 11,035,361\nDilutive effect of outstanding restricted share awards 283,705 390,488 589,740\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 8,592,572 10,442,176 11,625,101\nFor the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, there were no anti-\ndilutive shares included in the calculation of common stock equivalents as there were no stock options\noutstanding.\nUnissued shares of common stock were reserved for the following purposes:\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nTime-based restricted stock awards outstanding 376,618 274,939 420,628\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards outstanding 100,000 225,000 125,000\nFuture grants of options or shares 603,044 890,682 107,924\nShares reserved for employee stock purchase plan 297,730 364,231 448,110\nTotal 1,377,392 1,754,852 1,101,662\nF-29\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SHARE BASED COMPENSATION\nAt December 30, 2023, the Company had two share-based employee compensation plans, the Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan and the 2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.\nThe Company measures the fair value of share-based awards, if and when granted, based on the Black-Scholes\nmethod and using the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Awards\ntypically vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within 10 years of issuance. The Company\nmay also issue immediately vested equity awards. Share-based compensation expense related to time-based\nawards is amortized in accordance with applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. The\nCompany expenses performance-based awards only when the performance metrics are likely to be achieved and\nthe associated awards are therefore likely to vest. Performance-based share awards that are likely to vest are\nalso expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period but may vest on a retroactive basis or be reversed,\ndepending on when it is determined that they are likely to vest, or in the case of a reversal when they are later\ndetermined to be unlikely to vest or forfeited. Discussion of share and share-based awards herein references\nawards of shares and share units.\nShare-based compensation expense of $2.1 million, $1.6 million, and $1.4 million was recognized for the fiscal\nyears ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively. Share-based\ncompensation for performance-based equity agreements were $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.4 million for the\nfiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively. As of December\n30, 2023, there were 100,000 performance-based restricted stock awards outstanding. Share-based\ncompensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Company’s statement of\noperations.\nAs of December 30, 2023, the Company had $3.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, with nearly\nall of the unrecognized compensation cost related to time-based non-vested share-based awards outstanding.\nThe Company expects to recognize the expense associated with time-based non-vested share-based awards\nthrough fiscal 2027. These amounts do not include a) the cost of any additional share-based awards granted\nafter December 30, 2023 or b) the impact of any potential changes in the Company’s forfeiture rate.\nIncentive Share-Based Plans\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company implemented the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) with shareholder\napproval, effective January 1, 2001. Under the Purchase Plan, employees meeting certain specific employment\nqualifications are eligible to participate and can purchase shares of common stock semi-annually through\npayroll deductions at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the commencement or end of the\noffering period. The purchase plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock through\npayroll deductions for up to 10% of qualified compensation, subject to maximum purchases in any one fiscal\nyear of 3,000 shares.\nF-30\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SHARE BASED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (Continued)\nIn fiscal 2015, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,100,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Purchase Plan to December 31, 2025. In fiscal 2018,\nthe Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares\nof stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000 shares so that the\ntotal number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be 1,400,000 shares. In\nfiscal 2021, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 400,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,800,000 shares and the termination date of the Purchase Plan was extended to December 31, 2030.\nThe Company has two offering periods in the Purchase Plan coinciding with the Company’s first two fiscal\nquarters and the last two fiscal quarters. Actual shares are issued on the first business day of the subsequent\noffering period for the prior offering period payroll deductions. During the fiscal years ended December 30,\n2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, there were 66,501, 83,879 and 101,784 shares issued under the\nPurchase Plan for net proceeds of $0.7 million, $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. As of December 30,\n2023, there were 297,730 shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Compensation expense,\nrepresenting the discount to the quoted market price, for the Purchase Plan for the fiscal years ended December\n30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 was $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\n2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan)\nThe 2014 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in December 2014, initially provided for the issuance\nof up to 625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to officers, non-employee directors, employees of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries, or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company. In fiscal 2016, fiscal 2020\nand fiscal 2022, the Company amended, or amended and restated, the 2014 Plan with shareholder approval to\nincrease the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the Plan by an additional 500,000,\n850,000 and 1,000,000 shares, respectively, so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance\nunder the Plan is 2,975,000 shares. The expiration date of the Plan is December 17, 2030, unless the 2014 Plan\nis terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with the approval of the stockholders. The\nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the vesting period at the time of grant.\nAll stock awards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the\nCompany during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period assuming the grantee’s\nstock award fully vests. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December 30,\n2023, there were no accrued dividends. Dividends for stock awards that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nF-31\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\n2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting\ncredit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the\nFASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) -\nAmendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC\nSection on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which\namends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its\namendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022. CECL estimates of expected credit losses on trade receivables over their life will be\nrequired to be recorded at inception, based on historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. The Company adopted the standard in its first quarter of 2023. There was no material\nimpact on the results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This standard only applies to contracts and other\ntransactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be\ndiscontinued due to reference rate reform. This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and\nexceptions to accounting guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease entities’ financial\nreporting burdens as the market transitions from the LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative\nreference rates. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the sunset date of Topic\n848. This update defers the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may\nelect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment\nreporting (Topic 280)”, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements through\nenhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments require disclosure of significant\nsegment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as well as other segment\nitems, extend certain annual disclosures to interim periods, clarify the applicability to single reportable segment\nentities, permit more than one measure of profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and require\ndisclosure of the title and position of the CODM. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of\nthe ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early\nadoption is also permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for\nthe fiscal year ending December 28, 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures, which requires the annual financial statements to include consistent categories and greater\ndisaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.\nASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company’s annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with\nearly adoption permitted, and should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. We are\ncurrently evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on our disclosures.\nF-35\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

INCOME TAXES\nGenerally, the Company’s relative income or loss generated in each of its jurisdictions can materially impact the\nconsolidated effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax\nincome, versus United States pretax income. The consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscal years ended\nDecember 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were 24.2%, 26.7% and 21.0%, respectively. The\nCompany’s United States Federal statutory tax rate for fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31,\n2022 and January 1, 2022, before any adjustments, was 21.0%. The income tax provisions reconciled to the tax\ncomputed at the United States Federal statutory rate for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nFederal statutory rate 21.0% 21.0 % 21.0 %\nTax expense on taxable\nincome at federal statutory rate $4,661 $5,981 $2,922\nState and Puerto Rico income taxes,\nnet of Federal income tax benefit 1,082 1,373 519\nPermanent differences domestic and foreign (269) 109 (771 )\nForeign income tax rates 25 15 89\nOther (135) 113 (166 )\nTotal income tax expense $5,364 $7,591 $2,925\nF-39\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company’s tax positions is subject to change\nbased on future events including, but not limited to, the settlements of ongoing audits and/or the expiration of\napplicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, it is\nreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits will not change during the next\n12 months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes and timing of those events could cause the\nCompany’s current estimate to change materially in the future.\nThe Company accounts for penalties or interest related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for\nincome taxes and records such amounts to tax expense. The Company recorded no expense for penalties or\ninterest in the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022.\nAt December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the\nfollowing:\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nAllowance for doubtful accounts $421 $270 $297\nFederal and state net operating loss carryforward 48 - 1,153\nCompensation 747 775 693\nReserves, accruals, and other 760 296 421\nLease liability 777 1,118 844\nNet operating loss carryforward, Germany 55 - -\nTotal deferred tax assets 2,808 2,459 3,408\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nIntangible assets, net of amortization (1,860) (1,696 ) (1,428)\nPrepaid expense deferral (1,044) (872 ) (552)\nFixed assets, net of depreciation (689) (433 ) (392)\nRight of use assets (728) (953 ) (501)\nDeferred tax liability, net, Canada (187) (166 ) (142)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (4,508) (4,120 ) (3,015)\nTotal deferred tax (liabilities) assets, net ($1,700) ($1,661 ) $393\nThe Company has gross state net operating losses of $0.6 million and foreign net operating losses of $0.1\nmillion to be applied to the net income of future tax returns, respectively. The state net operating losses are\nsubject to various expiration periods. The foreign net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period.\nThe Company conducts its operations in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Germany,\nPuerto Rico and Serbia. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated United States Federal income tax\nreturn and file in various states. The Company has no open federal or state audits as of December 30, 2023.\nThe Company is no longer subject to audits by state and local tax authorities for tax years prior to 2019. The\nCompany is no longer subject to audit in Canada for the tax years prior to tax year 2019. The Company is no\nlonger subject to audit in Puerto Rico for the tax years prior to tax year 2018.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily\nfrom the effect of state and local income taxes, and share-based compensation. The actual 2023 effective tax\nrate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in various jurisdictions, and\nthe exercise of stock options and vesting of share-based awards.\nF-41\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)\nUnder APB 23, foreign earnings are generally not subject to U.S. tax until repatriated or deemed repatriated\nunder the anti-deferral rules. The Company has determined that as of December 30, 2023, all current and future\nearnings in its foreign subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested. Based on this determination, the anti-\ndeferral rules have no material impact on the Company.\n16. CONTINGENCIES\nFrom time to time, the Company is a defendant in various legal actions that arise in the ordinary business\ncourse. These matters may relate to professional liability, tax, compensation, contract, competitor disputes, and\nemployee-related matters and include individual and class action lawsuits, as well as inquiries and\ninvestigations by governmental agencies regarding the Company’s employment and compensation practices.\nAdditionally, some of the Company’s clients may also become subject to claims, governmental inquiries and\ninvestigations, and legal actions relating to the Company’s professional services. Depending upon the particular\nfacts and circumstances, the Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations under its contracts\nwith such clients relating to these matters.\nAs such, the Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as\npotential ranges of losses and possible recoveries. The Company may not be covered by insurance as it pertains\nto some or all of these matters. A determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments\nand contingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each matter.\nThe Company records a liability when management believes an adverse outcome from a loss contingency is\nboth probable and the amount, or a range, can be reasonably estimated. From time to time, the Company must\nestimate the potential loss even though the party adverse to the Company has not asserted any specific amounts.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount. The\nCompany reviews its loss contingencies at least quarterly and it adjusts its accruals and/or disclosures to reflect\nthe impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, or other new information, as deemed\nnecessary. Once established, a provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in\ncircumstances. The Company could increase or decrease its earnings in the period that the changes are made.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of December 30, 2023, where the Company believes it\nhas a probability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of\nloss has not been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims\ncould result in an unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company\nbelieves that such matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 30, 2023, the\nCompany has accrued $2.9 million for asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by\nthe Company is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not\ndetermined if it has any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually\nlimited to an amount no higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found\nliable, any damages would be covered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum\ncoverage of $5.0 million. While the Company attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has\nreserved $0.5 million for this project. The Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3\nmillion or that liability over $0.5 million, if any, will be covered by insurance.\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the\nordinary course of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\nF-42\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

RETIREMENT PLANS\nProfit Sharing Plans\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) profit sharing plan for the benefit of eligible employees in the United States\nand other similar plans in Canada, Puerto Rico and Serbia (the “Retirement Plans”). The 401(k) plan includes a\ncash or deferred arrangement pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code sponsored by the\nCompany to provide eligible employees an opportunity to defer compensation and have such deferred amounts\ncontributed to the 401(k) plan on a pre-tax basis, subject to certain limitations. The Company, at the discretion\nof the Board of Directors, may make contributions of cash to match deferrals of compensation by participants in\nthe Retirement Plans. Contributions to the Retirement Plans charged to operations by the Company for the\nfiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were $698, $626 and $721,\nrespectively.\n18. COMMITMENTS\nExecutive Severance Agreements\nThe Company is a party to an Executive Severance Agreement (the “Executive Severance Agreement”) with\neach of Bradley S. Vizi, the Company's Executive Chairman and President (dated as of June 1, 2018), and\nKevin D. Miller, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (dated as of February 28, 2014, as amended), which set\nforth the terms and conditions of certain payments to be made by the Company to the executive in the event,\nwhile employed by the Company, such executive experiences (a) a termination of employment unrelated to a\n“Change in Control” (as defined therein) or (b) there occurs a Change in Control and either (i) the executive’s\nemployment is terminated for a reason related to the Change in Control or (ii) in the case of Mr. Miller, the\nexecutive remains continuously employed with the Company for a period of three months following the Change\nin Control. Each Executive Severance Agreement also provide for certain payments, if either (a) the executive\nis involuntarily terminated by the Company for any reason other than “Cause” (as defined therein), “Disability”\n(as defined therein) or death, or (b) the executive resigns for “Good Reason” (as defined therein), and, in each\ncase, the termination is not a “Termination Related to a Change in Control” (as defined therein).\nLeases\nLeases are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 842, Leases which requires lessees to recognize a right of\nuse (“ROU”) asset and an operating right of use liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months and\nrequires disclosures by lessees and lessors about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from\nleases.\nF-43\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n18. COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)\nLeases (Continued)\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases where the Company is the lessee,\nright of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets and lease\nliabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the\nlease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining\nthe present value of lease payments. The right of use asset also consists of any lease incentives received. The\nlease terms used to calculate the right of use asset and related lease liability include options to extend or\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for\noperating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense while the\nexpense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation expense and interest expense using the accelerated\ninterest method of recognition. The Company has lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-\nlease components. The Company has elected to account for these as a single lease component with the\nexception of its real estate leases.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nOperating lease cost $1,428 $1,598 $1,891\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right of use assets $484 $487 $401\nInterest on lease liabilities 4 7 9\nTotal finance lease cost $488 $494 $410\nSupplemental Cash Flow information related to leases was as follows:\nDecember 30, December 31, January 1,\n2023 2022 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement\nof lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $1,464 $1,633 $1,957\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $5 $8 $9\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases $462 $508 $415\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations\nOperating leases $33 $2,790 $830\nFinance leases - $257 $1,002\nF-44\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Use of Estimates and Uncertainties\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe Company uses estimates to calculate an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivables,\nlitigation, medical claims, vacation, goodwill impairment, if any, equity compensation, the tax rate applied and\nthe valuation of certain assets and liability accounts. In addition, the Company reviews its estimated costs to\ncomplete a contract and adjusts those costs when necessary. These estimates can be significant to the operating\nresults and financial position of the Company. The estimates are based upon various factors including current\nand historical trends, as well as other pertinent industry and regulatory authority information, including the\npotential future effects of COVID-19. Management regularly evaluates this information to determine if it is\nnecessary to update the basis for its estimates and to adjust for known changes.\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care\ninsurance. The amounts included in the Company’s costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can\nvary based on changes in assumptions, the Company’s claims experience or the providers included in the\nassociated insurance programs.\nThe Company can be affected by a variety of factors including uncertainty relating to the performance of the\ngeneral economy, competition, demand for the Company’s services, adverse litigation and claims and the\nhiring, training and retention of key employees.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s carrying value of financial instruments, consisting primarily of accounts receivable, transit\naccounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, transit accounts payable and borrowings under\nline of credit approximates fair value due to their liquidity or their short-term nature and the line of credit’s\nvariable interest rate. The Company does not have derivative products in place to manage risks related to\nforeign currency fluctuations for its foreign operations or for interest rate changes.\nThe Company re-measures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period and any\nchange in the fair value from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, is\nrecorded in earnings in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\n10\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring\nservices promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to\nreceive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate\nservice streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the\ncontract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the\ntransaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize\nrevenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company’s Engineering Services, Life Sciences\nand Information Technology segments perform consulting and project solution services. The Healthcare\nsegment specializes in long-term and short-term staffing and placement services to hospitals, schools and long-\nterm care facilities amongst others. All of the Company’s segments perform staff augmentation services and\nderive revenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company’s revenue is invoiced on a time\nand materials basis.\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue source for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks\nended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021:\nThirteen Twenty-Six\nWeeks Ended Weeks Ended\nJuly 2, July 3, July 2, July 3,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nEngineering:\nTime and Material $13,790 $11,821 $26,739 $22,299\nFixed Fee 7,116 5,113 14,065 9,034\nPermanent Placement Services - - - 67\nTotal Engineering $20,906 $16,934 $40,804 $31,400\nSpecialty Health Care:\nTime and Material $43,045 $22,729 $95,068 $43,661\nPermanent Placement Services 412 212 573 416\nTotal Specialty Health Care $43,457 $22,941 $95,641 $44,077\nLife Sciences and Information Technology:\nTime and Material $9,796 $8,864 $19,498 $17,661\nPermanent Placement Services 187 194 364 344\nTotal Life Sciences and Information Technology $9,983 $9,058 $19,862 $18,005\n$74,346 $48,933 $156,307 $93,482\n11\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n3. Revenue Recognition (Continued)\nTime and Material\nThe Company’s IT and Healthcare segments predominantly recognize revenue through time and material work\nwhile its Engineering segment recognizes revenue through both time and material and fixed fee work. The\nCompany’s time and material contracts are typically based on the number of hours worked at contractually\nagreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials contracts are recognized based on\nhours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed Fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of\nits customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements\nare typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that\nfixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company’s fixed fee\npurchase orders are typically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are\nprovided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain\ninstances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue\nunder these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. From time-to-time,\namounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAdditionally, some contracts contain “Performance Fees” (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget.\nPerformance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified\nmaximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined.\nFor contracts where there is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the revenue is not\nrecognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the\nrelated revenue is recognized.\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are\ntypically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company’s client.\nDeferred Revenue\nThere was $2.2 million of deferred revenue as of July 2, 2022. Deferred revenue was $3.4 million as of January\n1, 2022. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be recognized\nover a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet. For the thirteen weeks\nended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, the Company recognized $1.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of\ndeferred revenue recorded at the beginning of the period. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July\n3, 2021, the Company recognized $2.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of deferred revenue recorded at\nthe beginning of the period.\n12\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n4. Accounts Receivable, Transit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payable\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are comprised as follows:\nJuly 2, January 1,\n2022 2022\nBilled $38,513 $37,396\nAccrued and unbilled 4,479 10,231\nWork-in-progress 3,458 1,810\nAllowance for sales discounts and doubtful accounts (1,175 ) (1,197 )\nAccounts receivable, net $45,275 $48,240\nUnbilled receivables primarily represent revenue earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the\nbalance sheet ending date. Work-in-progress primarily represents revenue earned under contracts which the\nCompany contractually invoices at future dates.\nFrom time to time, the Company’s Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things,\nconstruction management and engineering services. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may engage\nsubcontractors to provide construction or other services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project\nvalue; and c) assumes no ownership or risks of inventory. In such situations, the Company acts as an agent\nunder the provisions of FASB ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and therefore recognizes\nrevenue on a “net-basis.” The Company records revenue on a “net” basis on relevant engineering and\nconstruction management projects, which require subcontractor/procurement costs or transit costs. In those\nsituations, the Company charges the client a negotiated fee, which is reported as net revenue when earned.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the\ncorresponding payment from the Company’s end-client is received. Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of\nthe subcontractor or staffing agency, the Company records this amount simultaneously as both a “transit\naccount receivable” and “transit account payable,” as the amount when paid to the Company is due to and\ngenerally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The Company typically does not pay a given transit\naccount payable until the related transit account receivable is collected. The Company is typically obligated to\npay the subcontractor or staffing agency whether or not the client pays the Company. The Company’s transit\naccounts payable generally exceeds the Company’s transit accounts receivable but absolute amounts and\nspreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The transit accounts\nreceivable was $1.3 million and related transit accounts payable was $2.2 million, for a net payable of $0.9\nmillion, as of July 2, 2022. The transit accounts receivable was $1.0 million and related transit accounts\npayable was $2.1 million, for a net payable of $1.1 million, as of January 1, 2022.\n13\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and are depreciated\nor amortized on the straight-line method at rates calculated to provide for retirement of assets at the end of their\nestimated useful lives. Computer hardware and software, and furniture and office equipment are typically\ndepreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the\nasset or the lease term.\nProperty and equipment are comprised of the following:\nJuly 2, January 1,\n2022 2022\nComputers and systems $3,895 $4,133\nEquipment and furniture 83 86\nLeasehold improvements 207 159\n4,185 4,378\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization 2,299 2,439\nProperty and equipment, net $1,886 $1,939\nThe Company periodically writes off fully depreciated and amortized assets. The Company wrote off fully\ndepreciated and amortized assets of $603 and $451 during the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3,\n2021, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for the thirteen weeks\nended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 was $225 and $259, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense\nof property and equipment for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 was $463 and $525,\nrespectively.\n6. Acquisitions and Divestitures\nThe Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally\nincluded significant future contingent consideration. The Company gives no assurance that it will make\nacquisitions in the future or that if it does make acquisitions, such acquisitions will be successful.\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of July 2, 2022, the Company had one active acquisition agreement whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the former shareholders: effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired\ncertain assets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, “TKE”).\nThe Company estimates future contingent payments at July 2, 2022 as follows:\nFiscal Year Ending Total\nDecember 31, 2022 $ -\nDecember 30, 2023 300\nDecember 29, 2024 304\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $604\n14\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n6. Acquisitions and Divestitures (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments (Continued)\nFor acquisitions that involve contingent consideration, the Company records a liability equal to the fair value of\nthe estimated contingent consideration obligation as of the acquisition date. The Company determines the\nacquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on the likelihood of paying the additional\nconsideration. The fair value is estimated using projected future operating results and the corresponding future\nearn-out payments that can be earned upon the achievement of specified operating objectives and financial\nresults by acquired companies using Level 3 inputs and the amounts are then discounted to present value. These\nliabilities are measured quarterly at fair value, and any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration\nliability is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. During the measurement period, which may\nbe up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\nperiod or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of July 2, 2022. Contingent\nconsideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in\nother (expense) income, net.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company remeasured the value of its contingent consideration. The primary\ndriver for remeasuring the contingent consideration was the performance by TKE, acquired by RCM in 2018.\nThis remeasurement led to a $1.7 million reduction to the contingent consideration liability relating to the TKE\nacquisition. TKE had high yearly performance targets to achieve earn-out consideration. Two factors primarily\ncontributed to TKE not hitting its performance targets. The first was the COVID-19 pandemic which\noverlapped earn-out years two and three. TKE had numerous projects in its pipeline that were delayed or\neliminated by prospective clients. The second factor relates to a specific client in earn-out year three. This\nclient was dissatisfied with the product output, and TKE agreed to fix the equipment. The additional cost caused\nTKE to miss its earn-out target. Based on these factors, the Company decided to amend its asset purchase\nagreement with TKE, whereby TKE may receive maximum contingent consideration of $0.7 million, with\nportions earnable based on performance in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.\nPotential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after July 2, 2022 are capped at a\ncumulative maximum of $0.6 million. The Company paid $0.1 million and $0.5 million of contingent\nconsideration during the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, respectively.\n15\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n6. Acquisitions and Divestitures (Continued)\nSale of Assets\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its Pickering and Kincardine\noffices, located in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often referred to as Canada Power Systems and\nprincipally provided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The two Canada\nPower Systems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company’s Engineering segment. The Company\nwill continue to offer other engineering services in Canada and similar services in the United States. The\nCompany evaluated this transaction under ASC 205-20, discontinued operations and determined it did not meet\nthe requirements to be treated as such. For the twenty-six weeks ended July 3, 2021, these two offices\ngenerated revenue of $4.4 million. The purchase agreement provides for a typical indemnity escrow held by an\nindependent escrow agent in the amount of $0.8 million. The escrow has not been recognized in the Company’s\nfinancial statements, as the Company does not control the escrow. Provided there are no asserted indemnity\nclaims, the Company expects to receive up to $0.7 million within 18 months from the purchase date.\n7. Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in\nbusiness combinations. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the\nCompany's fiscal year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value\nof goodwill may be below the carrying amount. The Company reviewed industry and market conditions,\nreporting unit specific events as well as overall financial performance and determined that no indicators of\nimpairment of goodwill existed during the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022. As such, no impairment loss\non the Company’s intangible assets during the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 was recorded as a result of\nsuch review.\nThe carrying amount of goodwill as of July 2, 2022 and January 1, 2022 was as follows:\nSpecialty Information\nEngineering Health Care Technology Total\n$11,918 $2,398 $2,038 $16,354\n16\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n8. Line of Credit\nThe Company’s Revolving Credit Facility provides for a $45.0 million revolving credit facility, has no sub-limit\nfor letters of credit, and expires on August 8, 2023.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate),\nplus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate\ngenerally borrowed over shorter durations. At the option of Citizens Bank, LIBOR can be replaced with SOFR\n(Secured Overnight Financing Rate). Citizens Bank has not indicated when this switch may occur, but in any\nevent, the Company does not believe there will be any material impact on its borrowing rate. The Company\nalso pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line\nfees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rates, including unused line fees,\nfor the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 were 1.9% and 2.2%, respectively.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and a\npledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various financial and non-\nfinancial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order to pay dividends.\nAs of July 2, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit\nFacility (as amended).\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of July 2, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were zero and $14.2 million,\nrespectively. At both July 2, 2022 and January 1, 2022 there were letters of credit outstanding for $1.9 million.\nAt July 2, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the\nRevolving Credit Facility of $43.1 million and $28.9 million, respectively.\n17\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n9. Per Share Data\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares outstanding used for\ndiluted earnings per share. The number of weighted-average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings\nper share for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 was determined as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended\nJuly 2, July 3, July 2, July 3,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 10,133,279 11,141,518 10,181,895 11,340,453\nDilutive effect of outstanding restricted share units 417,617 390,804 401,624 410,893\nWeighted average dilutive shares outstanding 10,550,896 11,532,322 10,583,519 11,751,346\nFor all periods presented, there were no anti-dilutive shares included in the calculation of common stock\nequivalents as there were no stock options outstanding.\nUnissued shares of common stock were reserved for the following purposes:\nJuly 2, January 1,\n2022 2022\nTime-based restricted stock units outstanding 319,195 420,628\nPerformance-based restricted stock units outstanding 75,000 125,000\nPerformance-based restricted stock units outstanding\nunder plans to be approved by the shareholders 25,000 -\nFuture grants of options or shares 46,182 107,924\nShares reserved for employee stock purchase plan 410,977 448,110\nTotal 876,354 1,101,662\n10. Share-Based Compensation\nAt July 2, 2022, the Company had two share-based employee compensation plans. The Company measures the\nfair value of share-based awards, if and when granted, based on the Black-Scholes method and using the closing\nmarket price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Awards typically vest over periods ranging\nfrom one to five years and expire within 10 years of issuance. The Company may also issue immediately vested\nequity awards. Share-based compensation expense related to time-based awards is amortized in accordance\nwith applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. The Company expenses performance-based\nawards only when the performance metrics are likely to be achieved and the associated awards are therefore\nlikely to vest. Performance-based share awards that are likely to vest are also expensed on a straight-line basis\nover the vesting period but may vest on a retroactive basis or be reversed, depending on when it is determined\nthat they are likely to vest, or in the case of a reversal when they are later determined to be unlikely to vest or\nforfeited.\nShare-based compensation expense for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, was $302 and\n$347, respectively. Share-based compensation expense for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3,\n2021, was $705 and $710, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense in the Company’s income statement.\n18\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n10. Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\nAs of July 2, 2022, the Company had $1.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all time-\nbased non-vested share-based awards outstanding. The Company expects to recognize this expense over\napproximately five years. These amounts do not include a) the cost of any additional share-based awards\ngranted in future periods or b) the impact of any potential changes in the Company’s forfeiture rate.\nIncentive Share-Based Plans\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company implemented the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) with shareholder\napproval, effective January 1, 2001. Under the Purchase Plan, employees meeting certain specific employment\nqualifications are eligible to participate and can purchase shares of common stock semi-annually through\npayroll deductions at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the commencement or end of the\noffering period. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock through\npayroll deductions for up to 10% of qualified compensation, subject to maximum purchases in any one fiscal\nyear of 3,000 shares.\nIn fiscal 2015, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,100,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Purchase Plan to December 31, 2025. In fiscal 2018,\nthe Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares\nof stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000 shares so that the\ntotal number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be 1,400,000 shares. In\nfiscal 2021, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 400,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,800,000 shares and the termination date of the Purchase Plan was extended to December 31, 2030.\nThe Company has two offering periods in the Purchase Plan coinciding with the Company’s first two fiscal\nquarters and the last two fiscal quarters. Actual shares are issued on the first business day of the subsequent\noffering period for the prior offering period payroll deductions. The number of shares issued on January 3,\n2022 (the first business day following the previous offering period) was 37,133. As of July 2, 2022, there were\n410,977 shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan.\n2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan)\nThe 2014 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in December 2014, initially provided for the issuance\nof up to 625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to officers, non-employee directors, employees of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries, or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal\n2020, the Company amended and restated the 2014 Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the Plan by an additional 500,000 and 850,000 shares,\nrespectively, so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the Plan is 1,975,000\nshares. The expiration date of the Plan is December 17, 2030, unless the 2014 Plan is terminated earlier by the\nBoard or is extended by the Board with the approval of the stockholders. The Compensation Committee of the\nBoard of Directors determines the vesting period at the time of grant.\n19\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\n2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan) (Continued)\nAs of July 2, 2022, under the 2014 Plan, 319,195 time-based shares were outstanding, 75,000 performance-\nbased restricted share units were outstanding and 46,182 shares were available for awards thereunder. As of\nJuly 2, 2022, there was one outstanding grant for performance-based restricted stock units. The target number of\nshares for this grant of performance-based restricted stock units is 100,000 shares but may be increased to\n125,000 shares depending on the performance metrics achieved. No more than 75,000 shares may come from\nthe 2014 Plan. Any additional amount over 75,000 shares must come from future amounts approved by the\nCompany's shareholders.\nThe market value of equity grants issued for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 was $3.4\nmillion and $1.2 million, respectively. These amounts are based on the equity price on the last trading day in\nthe period presented.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Awards\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues time-based restricted stock awards. These time-based restricted stock\nawards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company\nduring the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period assuming the grantee’s restricted\nstock award fully vests. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of July\n2, 2022, there were no accrued dividends. Dividends for time-based restricted stock units that ultimately do not\nvest are forfeited.\nThe following summarizes the activity in the time-based restricted stock units under the 2014 Plan during the\ntwenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022:\nNumber of Weighted\nTime-Based Average\nRestricted Grant Date Fair\nStock Units Value per Share\nOutstanding non-vested at January 1, 2022 420,628 $2.69\nGranted 50,000 $6.71\nVested (88,175 ) $2.85\nForfeited or expired (63,258 ) $1.87\nOutstanding non-vested at July 2, 2022 319,195 $3.44\nBased on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $19.23 per share on July 1, 2022 (the last trading\nday prior to July 2, 2022), the intrinsic value of the time-based non-vested restricted stock units at July 2, 2022\nwas approximately $6.1 million. As of July 2, 2022, there was approximately $0.6 million of total\nunrecognized compensation cost related to time-based restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized\nover the average weighted remaining vesting period of the restricted stock units through fiscal 2027.\nDuring the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022, the Company did not award immediately vested share awards.\nDuring the twenty-six weeks ended July 3, 2021, the Company awarded 125,000 immediately vested share\nawards at an average price of $2.17.\n20\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nFrom time-to-time, the Company issues performance-based restricted stock units to its executives.\nPerformance-based restricted stock units are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics\nas determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee. These performance-based restricted stock\nunits typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company\nduring the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period on any stock awards that actually\nvest, if any. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts\npayable and accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of July 2, 2022,\nthere were no accrued dividends for performance-based restricted stock units. Dividends for performance-based\nrestricted stock units that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nTo date, the Company has issued performance-based restricted stock units only under the 2014 Plan. The\nfollowing summarizes the activity in the performance-based restricted stock units during the twenty-six weeks\nended July 2, 2022:\nNumber of\nPerformance- Weighted\nBased Average\nRestricted Grant Date Fair\nStock Units Value per Share\nOutstanding non-vested at January 1, 2022 125,000 $3.26\nGranted 100,000 $6.15\nVested (125,000 ) $3.26\nForfeited or expired - -\nOutstanding non-vested at July 2, 2022 100,000 $6.15\nAs of July 2, 2022, there was one outstanding grant of performance-based restricted stock units. The target\nnumber of shares for this grant of performance-based restricted stock units is 100,000 shares but may be\nincreased to 125,000 shares depending on the performance metrics achieved. No more than 75,000 shares may\ncome from the 2014 Plan. Any additional amount over 75,000 shares must come from future amounts approved\nby the Company's shareholders. The Company assesses at each reporting date whether achievement of any\nperformance condition is probable and recognizes the expense when achievement of the performance condition\nbecomes probable. The Company will then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year\nperformance becomes probable and recognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite\nservice period. If at a later measurement date the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock\nawards deemed as likely to vest are deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed.\nThe Company has estimated as of July 2, 2022 that a total of 125,000 performance-based stock units will be\nearned for fiscal 2022 performance metrics. The total expense recorded for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks\nended July 2, 2022 for performance-based stock units was $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The total\nexpense recorded for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 3, 2021 for performance-based stock units\nwas $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\n21\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Treasury Stock Transactions\nOn January 13, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of the\nCompany’s common stock constituting, in the aggregate, up to an amount not to exceed $7.5 million. All of\nthese repurchases are conducted under the safe harbor from liability under certain market manipulation rules\nprovided by Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange act of 1934, as amended. On November 12, 2021, the\nCompany’s Board of Directors further increased the total amount available to repurchase shares up to an\namount not to exceed $19.1 million (including the initial $7.5 million authorized), consistent with the maximum\nlimitation set forth by the Company’s revolving line of credit. The program is designed to provide the Company\nwith enhanced flexibility over the long term to optimize its capital structure. Shares of the common stock may\nbe repurchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions. The program may be terminated or\nsuspended at any time at the discretion of the Company.\nDuring the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022, the Company purchased 406,480 shares at an average price of\n$6.84 per share. During the twenty-six weeks ended July 3, 2021, the Company purchased 842,055 shares at an\naverage price of $3.14 per share. As of July 2, 2022, the Company had $7.3 million available for future treasury\nstock purchases.\n12. New Accounting Standards and Updates from the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\n2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting\ncredit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the\nFASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) -\nAmendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC\nSection on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which\namends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its\namendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022. The Company believes the adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial\ninstruments, but it does not anticipate a material impact on results of operations. The Company is in the process\nof determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This standard only applies to contracts and other\ntransactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be\ndiscontinued due to reference rate reform. This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and\nexceptions to accounting guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease entities’ financial\nreporting burdens as the market transitions from the LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative\nreference rates. The Company may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022.\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements\nand related disclosures.\n22\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The Company is domiciled in the United States and its\nsegments operate in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Serbia. Revenue by geographic area for the\nthirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 was as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended\nJuly 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021\nRevenue\nU.

Income Taxes\nThe Company recognized $4.7 million of income tax expense for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022, as\ncompared to $0.8 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective income tax rate for\nthe current period was 27.1% as compared to 26.9% for the comparable prior-year period. The projected fiscal\n2022 income tax rates as of July 2, 2022, were approximately 27.5%, 23.6% and 15.6% in the United States,\nCanada and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially\nimpact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian\npretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The comparable prior-year period estimated income tax rates were\n28.0%, 26.4% and 15.2% in the United States, Canada and Serbia, respectively.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily\nfrom the effect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to\nthe Company. The actual 2022 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating\nincome earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options\nand vesting of share-based awards.\n25\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is a defendant in various legal actions that arise in the ordinary business\ncourse. These matters may relate to professional liability, tax, compensation, contract, competitor disputes, and\nemployee-related matters and include individual and class action lawsuits, as well as inquiries and\ninvestigations by governmental agencies regarding the Company’s employment and compensation practices.\nAdditionally, some of the Company’s clients may also become subject to claims, governmental inquiries and\ninvestigations, and legal actions relating to the Company’s professional services. Depending upon the particular\nfacts and circumstances, the Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations under its contracts\nwith such clients relating to these matters.\nAs such, the Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as\npotential ranges of losses and possible recoveries. The Company may not be covered by insurance as it pertains\nto some or all of these matters. A determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments\nand contingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each matter.\nThe Company records a liability when management believes an adverse outcome from a loss contingency is\nboth probable and the amount, or a range, can be reasonably estimated. From time to time, the Company must\nestimate the potential loss even though the party adverse to the Company has not asserted any specific amounts.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both probability of loss and the estimated amount. The Company\nreviews its loss contingencies at least quarterly and adjusts its accruals and/or disclosures to reflect the impact\nof negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, or other new information, as deemed necessary.\nOnce established, a provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances\nand could increase or decrease the Company’s earnings in the period that the changes are made.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of July 2, 2022, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss\nhas not been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could\nresult in an unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company\nbelieves that such matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of July 2, 2022, the Company\nhas accrued $2.6 million for asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by\nthe Company is not operating as intended, and that the Company is responsible. The Company is attempting to\nfind a mutually agreeable solution but has not determined if it has any liability. In the event of liability, the\nCompany believes its damages are contractually limited to $3.3 million. Since the Company has not determined\nthat a loss is probable, the Company has not accrued any liability for this project.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a\npandemic, which continues to present various health, business and other challenges throughout the United\nStates. As a result, we have closed or reduced many of our office locations, with much of our workforce\nworking from home. The duration and ultimate magnitude of the disruption remains uncertain. While the\nCompany has not seen any long-term negative impact from COVID-19, the pandemic may negatively impact\nour business, results of operations, and financial position in the future.\n.\n26\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Leases\nLeases are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 842, Leases which requires lessees to recognize a right of\nuse (“ROU”) asset and an operating right of use liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months and\nrequires disclosures by lessees and lessors about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from\nleases.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases where the Company is the lessee,\nright of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets and lease\nliabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the\nlease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining\nthe present value of lease payments. The right of use asset also consists of any lease incentives received. The\nlease terms used to calculate the right of use asset and related lease liability include options to extend or\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for\noperating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense while the\nexpense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation expense and interest expense using the accelerated\ninterest method of recognition. The Company has lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-\nlease components. The Company has elected to account for these as a single lease component with the\nexception of its real estate leases.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended\nJuly 2, July 3, July 2, July 3,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost $432 $535 $881 $1,072\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right of use assets $106 $91 $216 $182\nInterest on lease liabilities 2 1 4 3\nTotal finance lease cost $108 $92 $220 $185\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nThirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended\nJuly 2, July 3, July 2, July 3,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement\nof lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $437 $555 $915 $1,107\nOperating cash flows from finance leases 4 1 6 2\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases 180 74 271 148\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for lease\nobligations\nOperating leases $58 $26 $732 $171\nFinance leases - - - -\n27\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOVID-19 Considerations\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a\npandemic, which continues to present various health, business and other challenges throughout the United States. As\na result, we have closed or reduced many of our office locations, with much of our workforce working from home.\nThe duration and ultimate magnitude of the disruption remains uncertain. While the Company has not seen any\nlong-term negative impact from COVID-19, the pandemic may negatively impact our business, results of operations,\nand financial position in the future.\nIt is difficult to assess both the current and future impact from COVID-19 to the Specialty Health Care segment, due\nto the high degree of uncertainty around COVID-19 and the duration and extent of the pandemic, especially as it\nmay impact schools where many of our personnel work. While the Specialty Health Care segment has a small\nnumber of billable professionals performing services from home, in particular, through its telehealth services\nofferings, most of its billable staff works at client locations. The majority of the Specialty Health Care segment’s\nservices are historically delivered at schools and health care facilities. The Company believes that demand for much\nof its services is very high as a result of COVID-19. However, health care professionals, such as nurses and doctors,\nare scarce and difficult to recruit. Also, the Company believes that any major changes in the pandemic, such as a\nnew variant, could adversely impact revenue. For example, if the Specialty Health Care segment’s school clients\nwere to return to virtual learning as we experienced in 2020 and portions of 2021, the Specialty Health Care segment\ncould experience a material decline in revenue. Conversely, the Specialty Health Care clients’ demand for the\nCompany’s services may decline in the event the pandemic fully transitions to an endemic.\nThe Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic are protecting the health and safety of our employees\nand, especially in the healthcare segment, deploying our resources, including the talents of our employees, to help\nthe communities we serve meet and overcome the current challenges. Our ability to continue to operate without any\nsignificant negative operational impact from the COVID-19 pandemic will in part depend on our ability to protect\nour employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow the recommended actions of\ngovernment and health authorities to protect our employees, with particular measures in place for those working in\nour customer facilities.\nWhile our revenue, gross profit and operating income were negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 on a consolidated\nbasis and, for certain business lines, in fiscal 2021, we have maintained the consistency of our operations, to a\nsubstantial degree, from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to continue to adhere to our employee\nsafety measures as we seek to ensure that any disruptions to our operations remain as limited as possible during the\npandemic. However, the uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our\nworkforce and supply chain (for example, an inability of a key supplier or transportation supplier to source and\ntransport materials) that could negatively impact our operations. Any material changes to labor rates for the\nCompany’s workforce may have a material negative impact to revenue, gross profit and operating income.\n30\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview\nRCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the impact of\neconomic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company’s\nfinancial performance.\nThe Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven\nrecord of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to\noptimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong\nvertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.\nThe Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business\nprocesses to compete in today’s business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing\nbusiness and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses\ntoday are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact\non spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.\nNonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced life sciences,\ninformation technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they\ncan maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage.\nAlthough working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support\nincreasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a\ndemand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate\nthe potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.\nThe Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon\nfixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management\nand solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally\nendeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also\nrealizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical\nconsultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily\nprovided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company’s consultants based upon their\nskill level, experience and the type of work performed.\nThe majority of the Company’s services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the\nmore complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the\nnature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more\ncomplex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally\nterminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days’ notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically these contracts are for less than one year. The\nCompany recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.\n31\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview (Continued)\nCosts of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and\nemployees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses\nconsist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating\nactivities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries\nand benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company’s corporate marketing,\nadministrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these\nexpenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the\npurpose of segment financial reporting.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our consolidated financial statements,\nestimates are used for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-\nlived intangible assets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock awards, insurance liabilities, accounting for\nincome taxes and accrued bonuses.\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, Note\n1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1,\n2022. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies require significant, difficult or\ncomplex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. Such policies are summarized in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of the recently issued accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 12, New Accounting Standards,\nin the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.\n32\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nForward-looking Information\nThe Company’s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending\nprograms, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering, life sciences\nand information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company’s\noperating performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, global events such as the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic also have a substantial impact on our operations and financial results. The Company believes that its\nfiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings provides some\ninsulation from adverse trends. However, general economic declines could result in the need for future cost\nreductions or changes in strategy.\nAdditionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of\nemployment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with\nrespect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. There can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a\nsufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.\nThe consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company\ncompetes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company’s service\nlines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors\nand customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future,\nwhich could limit the Company’s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.\n33\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended July 3, 2021\nA summary of operating results for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 is as follows (in\nthousands):\nJuly 2, 2022 July 3, 2021\n% of % of\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue\nRevenue $74,346 100.0 $48,933 100.0\nCost of services 52,663 70.8 36,667 74.9\nGross profit 21,683 29.2 12,266 25.1\nSelling, general and administrative 13,264 18.1 10,055 20.5\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment 225 0.3 259 0.6\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets - 0.0 9 0.0\nOperating costs and expenses 13,489 18.4 10,323 21.1\nOperating income 8,194 11.2 1,943 4.0\nOther (income) expense, net (28 ) 0.0 201 0.4\nIncome before income taxes 8,222 11.2 1,742 3.6\nIncome tax expense 2,208 3.0 486 1.0\nNet income $6,014 8.2 $1,256 2.6\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. The\nfiscal quarters ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 consisted of thirteen weeks each.\nRevenue. Revenue increased 51.9%, or $25.4 million, for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 as compared to the\nthirteen weeks ended July 3, 2021 (the “comparable prior-year period”). Revenue increased $4.0 million in the\nEngineering segment, $20.5 million in the Specialty Health Care segment and $0.9 million in the Life Sciences and\nInformation Technology segment. See more detailed disclosure by segment in our Segment Discussion.\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services increased 43.6%, or $16.0 million, for the thirteen weeks\nended July 2, 2022 as compared to the comparable prior-year period. Cost of services increased primarily due to the\nincrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July\n3, 2021 was 70.8% and 74.9%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further information regarding changes in\ncost of services and gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses were $13.3 million\nfor the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 as compared to $10.1 million for the comparable prior-year period. As a\npercentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 18.1% for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 and 20.5% for the\ncomparable prior-year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\n34\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended July 3, 2021 (Continued)\nOther Expense (Income). Other expense (income) consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized\nloan costs on the Company’s line of credit, net of interest income, imputed interest on contingent consideration and\ngains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense (income), decreased by $0.1 million as compared\nto the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in interest expense, net. Interest expense decreased\nprimarily due to decreased borrowing, and also due to a decreased average borrowing rate under the Company’s line\nof credit.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). The Company recognized $2.2 million of income tax expense for the thirteen\nweeks ended July 2, 2022, as compared to $0.5 million of income tax benefit for the comparable prior-year period.\nThe consolidated effective income tax rate for the current period was 26.9% as compared to 27.5% for the\ncomparable prior-year period. The projected fiscal 2022 income tax rates as of July 2, 2022, were approximately\n27.2%, 23.6% and 16.4% in the United States, Canada, and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss\ngenerated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company,\nparticularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The effective income tax\nrate can also be impacted by discrete permanent differences affecting any period presented.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the\neffect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company.\nThe actual 2022 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating income earned in\nvarious jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-\nbased awards.\nSegment Discussion\nEngineering\nEngineering revenues of $20.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 increased 23.5%, or $4.0 million,\ncompared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue was comprised of the following: increases\nin Aerospace revenue of $4.3 million, Industrial Processing revenue of $1.4 million, and Energy Services revenue of\n$0.4 million, offset by a decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of the Canadian Power Systems Group of $2.1\nmillion discussed below. The increase in Aerospace revenue was primarily due to a new outsourcing engagement\nwith one of the Company’s long-time customers and the Company’s entrance into the burgeoning rocket industry.\nThe increase in Industrial Processing revenue was primarily due to spending increases by several major customers\nseeking to upgrade their ethanol related production capability. Gross profit increased by 37.3%, or $1.5 million, as\ncompared to the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit increased because of the increase in revenue and an\nincrease in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin of 26.4% for the current period increased from 23.7% for the\ncomparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit margin was due to three factors: 1) decreased revenue\nfrom the Canadian Power Systems Group, as the prior-year gross profit margin was dilutive at 23.4%; 2) improved\nproject execution across all three of the Engineering business lines; and 3) a concerted effort to improve gross profit\nmargin through better managing utilization and focusing on higher gross profit margin opportunities. The\nEngineering segment’s SGA expense of $4.1 million increased by $0.5 million due to investment in new personnel\nto reposition and generate future growth. The Engineering segment experienced operating income of $1.3 million for\nthe thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022, as compared to $0.2 million for the comparable prior-year period.\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its Pickering and Kincardine\noffices, located in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often referred to as the Canadian Power Systems\nbusiness and principally provided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The two\nCanadian Power Systems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company’s Engineering segment. The\nCompany will continue to offer other engineering services in Canada and similar services in the United States. For\nthe thirteen weeks ended July 3, 2021, these two offices generated revenue of $2.1 million.\n35\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThirteen Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended July 3, 2021 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $43.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 increased 89.4%, or $20.5\nmillion, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue was driven by both the\nCompany’s school and non-school clients. Revenue from school clients for the thirteen weeks ended July 2,\n2022 was $32.3 million as compared to $15.1 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from non-\nschool clients for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 was $11.2 million as compared to $7.8 million for the\ncomparable prior-year period. Revenue increases were due to the reopening of Specialty Health Care School clients\nand unprecedented demand for health care professionals across all types of clients served. The Specialty Health Care\nsegment’s gross profit increased by 130.4%, or $7.3 million, to $12.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 2,\n2022, as compared to $5.6 million for the prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the\nincrease in revenue, but also a higher gross profit margin. Gross profit margin for the thirteen weeks ended July 2,\n2022 increased to 29.6% as compared to 24.4% for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit\nmargin was primarily due to more normalized revenue and the high demand for certain services. Specialty Health\nCare experienced operating income of $5.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022, as compared to $1.1\nmillion for the comparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the increase in operating income was the\nincrease to gross profit, offset by an increase in SGA expense. SGA expense increased by $2.8 million to $7.2\nmillion, as compared to $4.4 million in the comparable prior-year period. The increase in SGA expense was\nprimarily due to increasing our workforce to help meet increased demand.\nLife Sciences and Information Technology\nLife Sciences and Information Technology revenue of $10.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022\nincreased 10.2%, or $0.9 million, as compared to $9.1 million for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in\nLife Sciences and Information Technology revenue was primarily driven by the Company’s Life Sciences practice.\nThe Company believes that the Life Sciences industry has not seen a negative impact from COVID-19. Gross profit\nof $3.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 increased 23.7%, or $0.6 million, as compared to $2.7\nmillion for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in\nrevenue, as well as an increase in gross profit margin. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit\nmargin for the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022 was 33.0% as compared to 29.4% for the comparable prior-year\nperiod. The Company attributes the gross profit margin increase to higher revenue from its Life Sciences practice\nand a concerted effort to increase gross profit margin through its managed service offerings. SGA expense decreased\nby a negligible amount as compared to $2.0 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Life Sciences and\nInformation Technology segment experienced operating income of $1.3 million as compared to $0.7 million for the\ncomparable prior-year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenue and\ngross profit.\n36\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nTwenty-Six Weeks Ended July 2, 2022 Compared to Twenty-Six Weeks Ended July 3, 2021 (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the major captions from the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows (in thousands):\nTwenty-Six Weeks Ended\nJuly 2, July 3,\n2022 2021\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $20,755 $6,321\nInvesting activities ($453 ) ($182 )\nFinancing activities ($17,175 ) ($5,424 )\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided $20.8 million of cash for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 as compared to $6.3\nmillion in the comparable prior-year period. The major components of cash provided by operating activities in the\ntwenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and the comparable prior-year period are as follows: net income, and changes\nin accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and\nother current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs, and deferred revenue.\nFor the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022, the Company experienced net income of $12.5 million as compared to\n$2.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. A decrease in accounts receivables in the twenty-six weeks ended\nJuly 2, 2022 provided $3.6 million of cash as compared to using $0.9 million in the comparable prior-year period.\nThe Company primarily attributes this decrease in accounts receivables for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022\nto a concerted effort to gain efficiencies from its invoice processing and collection of cash in its Specialty Health\nCare segment.\nWhile highly variable, the Company’s transit accounts payable typically exceeds the Company’s transit accounts\nreceivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course\nof business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable of $0.9 million as\nof July 2, 2022 and a net payable of $1.1 million as of January 1, 2022, using $0.2 million of cash during the twenty-\nsix weeks ended July 2, 2022. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable\nof $2.3 million as of July 3, 2021 and a net payable of $2.4 million as of January 2, 2021, using $0.1 million of cash\nduring the twenty-six weeks ended July 3, 2021.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets provided cash of $0.4 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022\nas compared to $2.0 million of cash for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes changes to\nprepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of business.\nSince certain expenses are paid before a fiscal year concludes and are amortized over the next fiscal year, prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets generally tend to increase at the end of a fiscal year and decrease during the first\nhalf.\n40\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nOperating Activities (Continued)\nA decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used cash of $0.6 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July\n2, 2022 as compared to providing $1.7 million for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes these\nchanges to typical fluctuations in the normal course of business.\nChanges in accrued payroll and related costs provided cash of $3.0 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2,\n2022 as compared to using cash of $0.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. There are four primary factors\nthat generally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as\npayroll and related costs is the Company’s largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent\nall other factors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every\ntwo weeks and normally has twenty-six weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a\nmajor payroll on the last business day of every other quarter; 3) the timing of various payroll related payments varies\nin the normal course of business; and 4) most of the Company’s senior management participate in annual incentive\nplans and while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the\nextent they are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these\nincentive plan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The\nCompany’s last major payroll for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 was paid on July 1, 2022. During fiscal\n2020, the Company deferred $3.3 million of employer payroll taxes under the CARES Act. Half of these deferred\npayroll taxes were paid in December 2021 and the remaining portion must be paid in December 2022.\nHistorically, the Company has experienced small deferred revenue balances that have been included in accounts\npayable and accrued expenses. During the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company’ Industrial Processing group\nsecured several contracts with significant front-loaded payments, thereby generating larger deferred revenue\nbalances than typically generated. The Company’s deferred revenue balance as of July 2, 2022 was $2.2 million, as\ncompared to $3.4 million as of January 1, 2022, using cash from operations of $1.2 million for the twenty-six weeks\nended July 2, 2022.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $0.5 million of cash for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and $0.1 million of cash\nfor the comparable prior-year period. Investing activities used $0.4 million for the purchase of property and\nequipment in the current period as compared to $0.1 million in the comparable prior-year period.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities used $17.2 million of cash for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 as compared to $5.2\nmillion in the comparable prior-year period. The Company made net payments under its line of credit of $14.2\nmillion during the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 as compared to net payments of $2.2 million in the\ncomparable prior-year period. The Company used $2.8 million to repurchase shares of its common stock in the\ncurrent period as compared to $2.6 million in the comparable prior-year period. The Company generated cash of\n$0.1 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and $0.1 million for the comparable\nprior-year period.\n41\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), plus\napplicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally\nborrowed over shorter durations. At the option of Citizens Bank, LIBOR can be replaced with SOFR (Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate). The LIBOR alternative is being phased out in 2022. Citizens Bank has not indicated\nwhen this switch will occur, but in any event, the Company does not believe there will be any material impact on its\nborrowing rate. The Company also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that\nis not drawn. Unused line fees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate,\nincluding unused line fees, for the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 were 1.9% and 2.2%,\nrespectively.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various\nfinancial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order to\npay dividends. As of July 2, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving\nCredit Facility (as amended). The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial covenants\nfor the foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of July 2, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were zero and $14.2 million, respectively.\nAt both July 2, 2022 and January 1, 2022 there were letters of credit outstanding for $1.9 million. At July 2, 2022\nand January 1, 2022, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of\n$43.1 million and $28.9 million, respectively.\nIn addition to borrowings and sales of shares from its equity plans, the Company may raise capital through sales of\nshares of common stock under its at the market issuance program (the “ATM Program”) established under its May\n2021 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., as the agent (the “Agent”). The ATM\nProgram allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to\n$17.9 million from time to time through the Agent. The Company may also decide to increase the value of shares\navailable to sell if the Company’s stock price increases. To date, the Company has not sold any shares under the\nATM Program.\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations,\nand meet the other general cash needs of our business. Our liquidity is impacted by general economic, financial,\ncompetitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to\npay our expenses, principally labor-costs, and other related expenditures. We generally satisfy our liquidity needs\nthrough cash provided by operations and, when necessary, our revolving line of credit from Citizens Bank. The\nCompany believes it has a great deal of flexibility to reduce its costs if it becomes necessary. The Company believes\nthat it can satisfy its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months.\n42\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility (Continued)\nThe Company’s liquidity and capital resources as of July 2, 2022, included accounts receivable and total current\nasset balances of $45.3 million and $51.5 million, respectively. Current liabilities were $33.3 million as of July 2,\n2022 and were exceeded by total current assets by $18.2 million.\nThe Company experiences volatility in its daily cash flow and, at times, relies on the revolving line of credit to\nprovide daily liquidity for the Company’s financial operations. As of July 2, 2022, the Company was in compliance\nwith all financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it will maintain\ncompliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes.\nFunding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from\none or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or\nfuture financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time\nin the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final\noutcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the\nresults of operations.\nThe Company’s business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through\nstrategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates.\nThe Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally\nincluded significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase\nhowever, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such\nopportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No\nassurance can be given as to the Company’s future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such\nopportunities will be financed.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of July 2, 2022, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss has\nnot been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could result in\nan unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company believes that such\nmatters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of July 2, 2022, the Company has accrued $2.6 million\nfor asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the\nCompany is not operating as intended, and that the Company is responsible. The Company is attempting to find a\nmutually agreeable solution but has not determined if it has any liability. In the event of liability, the Company\nbelieves its damages are contractually limited to $3.3 million. Since the Company has not determined that a loss is\nprobable, the Company has not accrued any liability for this project.\nThe Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in\n1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company is implementing an\nupgrade of its current system during fiscal 2022. The Company estimates this upgrade or replacement of its\nfinancial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million. These estimates are\nsubject to material change.\n43\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments\nThe Company’s current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes\nthat its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of\nbusiness for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates\nthrough November 2027. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nOperating Finance\nFiscal Year Leases Leases\n2022 (After July 2, 2022) $677 $168\n2023 1,228 337\n2024 531 168\n2025 267 -\n2026 182 -\nThereafter 123 -\nTotal lease payments 3,008 673\nLess: imputed interest (113 ) (6 )\nTotal $2,895 $667\nAs of July 2, 2022, the Company had one active acquisition agreement whereby additional contingent consideration\nmay be earned by the former shareholders: effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets of\nThermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, “TKE”). The Company\nestimates future contingent payments at July 2, 2022 as follows:\nFiscal Year Ending Total\nDecember 31, 2022 $ -\nDecember 30, 2023 300\nDecember 29, 2024 304\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $604\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. Potential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after July 2, 2022\nare capped at a cumulative maximum of $0.6 million. The Company estimates future contingent consideration\npayments based on forecasted performance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of July 2,\n2022. During the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022, the Company measured the intangibles acquired at fair\nvalue on a non-recurring basis. Contingent consideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3)\nwith changes in fair value recorded in other (expense) income, net.\n44\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment\nportfolio and debt instruments, which primarily consist of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company does not\nhave any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio. The Company places its investments in instruments that\nmeet high credit quality standards. The Company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation\nof its invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. As of July 2, 2022, the Company’s\ninvestments consisted of cash and money market funds. The Company does not use interest rate derivative\ninstruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the Company’s variable-rate line of credit\nbalances during the twenty-six weeks ended July 2, 2022, if the interest rate on the Company’s variable-rate line of\ncredit (using an incremental borrowing rate) during the period had been 1.0% higher, the Company’s interest\nexpense on an annualized basis would have increased by $0.2 million. The Company does not expect any material\nloss with respect to its investment portfolio.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Principal\nExecutive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period\ncovered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer\nconcluded that those disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were\neffective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports\nthat it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nA controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives\nof the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues\nand instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nAs management prepares and executes its virtual financial close process, there could be related implications on the\ninternal controls performed specifically in conjunction with the preparation, review, and filing of this report. There\nis a risk that moving to a virtual environment in response to COVID-19 could result in certain controls (e.g.,\nfinancial closing and reporting controls) being overridden or performed less frequently, or that management could\nbe designing and implementing new controls in response to new risks. In addition, in instances where relevant\ncontrols fail, and there are no compensating controls in place, there may be fewer opportunities to timely identify or\nremediate control deficiencies. There were otherwise no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting during the thirteen weeks ended July 2, 2022, that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n45\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

BUSINESS\nGeneral\nRCM Technologies, Inc. is a premier provider of business and technology solutions designed to enhance and\nmaximize the operational performance of its customers. The Company provides these services through the\ndeployment of advanced specialty health care, engineering, life sciences and information technology services. For\nover 40 years, the Company has developed and assembled an attractive, diverse and extensive portfolio of\ncapabilities, service offerings and delivery options. This combination, paired with RCM’s efficient pricing\nstructure, offers clients a compelling value proposition.\nRCM consists of three operating segments: Specialty Health Care, Engineering and Life Sciences and Information\nTechnology services.\n The Specialty Health Care segment provides staffing solutions of health care professionals, primarily health\ninformation management professionals, nurses, paraprofessionals, physicians and various therapists. The\nsegment also provides Teletherapy services targeting the education sector with an emphasis on behavioral\nhealth.\n The Engineering segment provides a comprehensive portfolio of engineering and design services across\nthree verticals: (1) Energy Services, (2) Process & Industrial and (3) Aerospace. The segment also offers a\ncomplementary suite of services to augment its engineering portfolio, including design and supply of high-\nquality engineered process solutions and equipment, technical writing and digital documentation across\nmarine, locomotive, transportation and aerospace markets, and engineering, procurement and construction\nmanagement (“EPC”), as well as demand side management/energy conservation services.\n The Life Sciences and Information Technology, or LS&IT, segment provides enterprise business solutions,\napplication services, infrastructure solutions, life sciences solutions and other vertical-specific offerings.\nThe Company services some of the largest national and international companies in North America as well as a\nlengthy roster of Fortune 1000 and mid-sized businesses in such industries as Aerospace/Defense, Educational\nInstitutions, Energy, Financial Services, Health Care, Life Sciences, Manufacturing & Distribution, the Public\nSector and Technology. RCM sells and delivers its services through a network of approximately 26 offices in\nselected regions throughout North America and Serbia.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 56.0% of RCM’s total revenue were derived from\nSpecialty Health Care services, 30.2% from Engineering services, and the remaining 13.8% from Life Sciences and\nInformation Technology services.\nImpact of COVID-19\nAs discussed in more detail below under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact\non our business, particularly in our Specialty Health Care segment, where it impacted the schools where many of the\nCompany’s personnel work.\nIndustry Overview\nBusinesses today face intense competition, the challenge of constant technological change and the ongoing need for\nbusiness process optimization. To address these issues and to compete more effectively, companies are continually\nevaluating the need for implementing innovative solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes. As\na result, the ability of an organization to integrate and align advanced technologies with new business objectives is\ncritical.\n2\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nIndustry Overview (Continued)\nIn the health care services industry, a shortage of nurses and other medical personnel in the United States has led to\nincreases in business activity for health care service companies, including the Company’s Specialty Health Care\ngroup. Due in part to an aging population and improved medical technology, the demand for selected health care\nprofessionals is expected to continue over the next several years, with an emphasis on leveraging technology to\nexpand access to care. The increased adoption of telemedicine, an area in which the Specialty Health Care group has\ndeveloped new service offerings, is a primary example. In addition, public educational institutions are outsourcing\ntheir requirements for school nurses, therapists and paraprofessionals to lower their costs and it is expected that this\nwill continue and grow. Each of these dynamics have been exacerbated by COVID-19. The pandemic has also\naltered patterns in health care delivery, with newer delivery models gaining traction, namely telemedicine. Given\nfederal and state regulatory changes as well as private insurer reimbursement methods, utilization of telemedicine\nservices increased significantly. CDC researchers stated that maintaining the expansion of telehealth remains\ncritical to providing access to care. It is expected the total addressable market opportunity will continue to expand\nand grow. Expanding access to behavioral health and mental well-being is also a priority for public health officials.\nIncreasing and maintaining access to proper care remains a top priority and the market opportunity for these services\nis expected to continue to grow. While the Company believes that the demand for Healthcare related services\nremains historically high, the Company also believes this demand has subsided some as COVID-19 shifts from a\npandemic to an endemic.\nThe Company’s Engineering group remains focused on areas of growth, primarily within the electric power,\naerospace, marine and transportation, commercial and industrial, oil and gas, as well as biofuel industries. Given the\ncurrent composition of its customer base, the Engineering group’s performance is well balanced between its three\nsegments. In recent years, many electric utilities have prioritized transitioning their power generation assets to\ncleaner sources of energy. Much of this transformation is being driven by investments in renewable energy. The\nEnergy Information Administration (“EIA”) estimates that 38% of the United States’ electric generation capacity\nwill be comprised of wind and solar assets by 2050. This expansion will require extensive investment in the nation’s\ntransmission infrastructure to interconnect these renewable resources to the energy grid. Projects of this scale will\nrequire engineering and design expertise, as well as the utilization of EPC services. As the world’s industrial output\nrebounds from pandemic-related weakness in 2020 and 2021, the Company believes its Process and Industrial group\nis positioned well to take advantage. Companies in the chemical industry are reprioritizing spending towards\ndecarbonization technologies, with many US chemical companies expecting to place an emphasis on renewable\nfeedstocks and new carbon recycling technologies. The Company believes its process engineering services can play\na vital role across this multibillion-dollar opportunity.\nCompanies must integrate and manage computing environments consisting of multiple computing platforms,\noperating systems, databases and networking protocols and off-the-shelf software applications to support business\nobjectives. Companies also need to keep pace with new technology developments, which often rapidly render\nexisting equipment and internal skills obsolete. At the same time, varied factors have caused many organizations to\nfocus on core competencies and trim workforces in the IT management area. Accordingly, these organizations often\nlack the quantity, quality and variety of IT skills necessary to design and support IT solutions. IT managers are\ncharged with supporting increasingly complex systems and applications of significant strategic value, while working\nunder budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints within their own organizations.\nThe Company believes its target market for IT services is among middle-market companies, which typically lack the\ntime and technical resources to satisfy all of their IT needs internally. These companies commonly require\nsophisticated, experienced IT assistance to achieve their business objectives and often rely on IT service providers to\nhelp implement and manage their systems. RCM is structured to provide middle-market companies a single source\nfor their IT needs.\n3\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nBusiness Strategy\nRCM is dedicated to providing solutions to meet its clients’ business needs by delivering specialty health care,\nengineering, life sciences and information technology services. The Company’s objective is to remain a recognized\nleader of specialized professional staffing, consulting services and solutions in major markets throughout North\nAmerica. The Company adapts operating strategies to achieve this objective. The following is a discussion of the\nkey elements of its growth and operating strategies:\nGrowth Strategy\nPromote Full Life Cycle Solution Capability\nThe Company promotes a full life cycle solution capability to its customers. The goal of the full life cycle solution\nstrategy is to fully address a client’s project implementation cycle at each stage of its development and deployment.\nThis entails the Company working with its clients from the initial conceptualization of a project through its design\nand project execution, and extending into ongoing management and support of the delivered product. RCM’s\nstrategy is to build projects and solutions offerings selectively, utilizing its extensive resource base.\nThe Company believes that the effective execution of this strategy will generate improved margins on its existing\nresources. The completion of this service-offering continuum is intended to afford the Company the opportunity to\nstrengthen long-term client relationships that will further contribute to a more predictable revenue stream.\nIn addition to a full life cycle solution offering, the Company continues to focus on transitioning into higher value\noriented services in an effort to increase its margins on its various service lines and generate revenue that is more\nsustainable. The Company believes this transition is accomplished by pursuing additional vertical market specific\nsolutions in conjunction or combination with longer-term based solutions, through expansion of its client\nrelationships and by pursuing strategic alliances and partnerships.\nAchieve Internal Growth\nThe Company continues to promote its internal growth strategies which it designed to better serve the Company’s\ncustomers, generate higher revenue and achieve greater operating efficiencies. Every division of the Company\ncontinuously focuses on services and client diversification. Business units are collaborating on penetrating and\nservicing accounts as sales teams are increasing their activity levels. This enables clients to be supported by\nspecialists in their areas of need while RCM productivity increases.\nRCM provides an orientation program in which sales managers and professionals receive relevant information about\nCompany operations.\nRCM has adopted an industry-centric approach to sales and marketing. This initiative contemplates that clients\nwithin the same industry sectors tend to have common business challenges. It therefore allows the Company to\npresent and deliver enhanced value to those clients in the vertical markets in which RCM has assembled the greatest\nwork experience. RCM’s consultants continue to acquire project experience that offers differentiated awareness of\nthe business challenges that clients in that industry are facing. This alignment also facilitates and creates additional\ncross-selling opportunities. The Company believes this strategy will lead to greater account penetration and\nenhanced client relationships.\nOperational strategies contributing to RCM’s internal productivity include the delineation of certain new solutions\npractice areas in markets where its clients had historically known the Company as a contract service provider. The\nformation of these practice areas facilitates the flow of project opportunities and the delivery of project-based\nsolutions.\n4\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nGrowth Strategy (Continued)\nPursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions\nThe industries in which the Company operates continue to be highly fragmented, and the Company plans to continue\nto selectively assess opportunities to make strategic acquisitions as such opportunities are presented to the Company.\nThe Company's acquisition strategy is designed to broaden the scope of services and technical competencies and\ngrow its full life cycle solution capabilities. In considering acquisition opportunities, the Company focuses\nprincipally on companies with (i) technologies or market segments RCM has targeted for strategic value\nenhancement, (ii) margins that are accretive to existing margins, (iii) experienced management personnel, (iv)\nsubstantial growth prospects and (v) sellers who desire to join the Company’s management team. To retain and\nprovide incentives for management of its acquired companies, the Company has generally structured a significant\nportion of the acquisition price in the form of multi-tiered consideration based on growth of operating profitability of\nthe acquired company over a two to four year period.\nOperating Strategy\nDevelop and Maintain Strong Customer Relationships\nThe Company seeks to develop and maintain strong interactive customer relationships by anticipating and focusing\non its customers’ needs. The Company emphasizes a relationship-oriented approach to business, rather than the\ntransaction or assignment-oriented approach that the Company believes is used by many of its competitors. This\nindustry-centric strategy is designed to allow RCM to expand further its relationships with clients in RCM’s targeted\nsectors.\nTo develop close customer relationships, the Company’s practice managers and/or salespeople regularly meet with\nboth existing and prospective clients to identify areas of need and help design solutions and identify the resources\nneeded to execute their strategies. The Company’s managers also maintain close communications with their\ncustomers during each project and on an ongoing basis after its completion. The Company believes that this\nrelationship-oriented approach can result in greater customer satisfaction. Additionally, the Company believes that\nby collaborating with its customers in designing business solutions, it can generate new opportunities to cross-sell\nadditional services that the Company has to offer. The Company focuses on providing customers with qualified\nindividuals or teams of experts compatible with the business needs of its customers and makes a concerted effort to\nfollow the progress of such relationships to ensure their continued success.\nAttract and Retain Highly Qualified Consultants and Technical Resources\nThe Company believes it has been successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified consultants and contractors\nby (i) providing stimulating and challenging work assignments, (ii) offering competitive wages, (iii) effectively\ncommunicating with its candidates, (iv) providing selective training to maintain and upgrade skills and (v) aligning\nthe needs of its customers with appropriately skilled personnel. The Company believes it has been successful in\nretaining these personnel due in part to its use of practice managers who are dedicated to maintaining contact with,\nand monitoring the satisfaction levels of, the Company’s consultants and contractors while they are on assignment.\n5\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nSpecialty Health Care\nThe Company’s Specialty Health Care Group specializes in long-term and short-term staffing as well as executive\nsearch and placement solutions for many of the largest healthcare institutions and school districts across the United\nStates.

Expanding access to behavioral health and mental wellness services is also a\npriority for many public health officials. The Company’s School Services and Telepractice offerings are well\npositioned to provide solutions in these areas of priority as the market opportunity for these services is expected to\ncontinue to grow.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company assigned approximately 2,540 specialty health care services personnel to its\ncustomers.\n6\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nEngineering\nRCM provides a full range of Engineering services including Project Management Engineering & Design,\nEngineering Analysis, Engineer-Procure-Construct, Configuration Management, Hardware/Software Validation &\nVerification, Quality Assurance, Technical Writing & Publications, Manufacturing Process Planning &\nImprovement and 3D/BIM Integrated Design. Engineering services are provided at the site of the client or at the\nCompany’s own facilities.\nThe Company’s Engineering segment consists of three business units – Energy Services, Aerospace Services and\nProcess & Industrial Services.\n Energy Services: Provides solutions to the utility industry, including power generation and transmission\nand distribution. The group has project experience that encompasses multi-disciplined engineering and\ndesign services as well as providing technical support during design, construction and plant operational\nphases. The Company believes that the deregulation of the utilities industry and the aging of nuclear power\nplants offer the Company an opportunity to capture a greater share of professional services and project\nmanagement requirements of the utilities industry. Electric utilities have prioritized transitioning their\npower generation assets to cleaner sources of energy. This expansion requires large-scale investment in the\nnation’s transmission infrastructure to interconnect these renewable resources to the energy grid.\n Aerospace Services: Provides engineering and technical services to the aerospace & defense industry.\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”), the Department of Defense plans to spend over $1\ntrillion in procurement-related aviation expenditures over the next three decades. Given RCM’s customer\naccount relationships with several of the largest defense prime contractors, the Company believes there is\nample opportunity for engineering services and technical publication work, including production and\nprocurement engineering services as well as the need for sustainment and development program publication\nservices.\n Process & Industrial Services: Provides engineering services to the industrial, chemical, commercial and\noil and gas industries in the United States, Europe and Canada. With many companies in the chemical\nindustry reprioritizing spending towards decarbonization technologies, many US chemical companies are\nexpected to place an emphasis on renewable feedstocks and new carbon recycling technologies. The\nCompany believes its process engineering services can play a vital role across this multibillion-dollar\nopportunity.\nThe Company provides its engineering services through a number of delivery methods. These include managed\ntasks and resources, complete project services, outsourcing, both on and off-site, and a full complement of\nresourcing alternatives.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company assigned approximately 490 engineering and technical personnel to its\ncustomers.\n7\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nLife Sciences and Information Technology\nThe Company’s Life Sciences and Information Technology segment is an integrated group of business units\nproviding staff supplementation services and project solutions with physical locations in the United States, Canada\nand Puerto Rico primarily supporting Financial, Technical, Manufacturing, Life Sciences and Distribution\napplications. Specialization in project solutions include, but are not limited to, the following areas:\n Life Sciences: Specializes in providing innovative options to pharmaceutical, medical device and\nbiotechnology companies in need of guidance, support or remediation of quality, compliance or business\nchallenges. The group assists in staffing, solution planning and remediation needs in the areas of\nautomation, compliance, data analytics, technical quality assurance and management, and validation and\nverification.\n IT Services & Solutions: Global provider of business and technology solutions designed to improve the\noperational performance of our clients. Specialties include software development, infrastructure services,\nand managed IT solutions. The Company has a 40-year history of providing qualified IT candidates to\ncustomers in a timely and cost-effective manner to address their specific business needs. The Company\noffers scalable solutions that can provide emerging growth companies with a single qualified resource or an\nentire project team along with RCM’s project management oversight to Fortune 100 clients.\nRCM’s sector knowledge coupled with technical and business process experience enable the Company to provide\nstrategic planning, project execution and management and support services throughout the entire project life cycle.\nRCM has successfully completed multimillion-dollar projects in a variety of industry verticals using time-tested\nmethodologies that manage strict budgets, timelines and quality metrics.\nThe Company believes that its ability to deliver life sciences and information technology solutions across a wide\nrange of technical platforms provides an important competitive advantage. RCM ensures that its consultants have\nthe expertise and skills needed to keep pace with rapidly evolving information technologies. The Company’s\nstrategy is to maintain expertise and acquire knowledge in multiple technologies so it can offer its clients non-biased\ntechnology solutions best suited to their business needs.\nThe Company provides its life sciences and information technology services through a number of flexible delivery\nmethods. These include management consulting engagements, project management of client efforts, project\nimplementation of client initiatives, outsourcing, both on and off site, and a full complement of resourcing\nalternatives.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company assigned approximately 230 Life Sciences and Information Technology\npersonnel to its customers.\n8\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nBranch Offices\nThe Company’s organization consists of 26 branch offices located in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and\nSerbia. The locations and services of each of the branch offices are set forth in the table below.\nNUMBER OF SERVICES\nLOCATION OFFICES PROVIDED(1)\nUNITED STATES\nArizona 1 HC\nCalifornia 3 HC, IT\nConnecticut 1 E\nFlorida 2 HC, E\nHawaii 1 HC\nIllinois 1 HC\nMassachusetts 1 IT\nMichigan 1 HC\nNew Jersey 2 E, IT\nNew York 4 E, HC, IT\nNorth Carolina 1 HC\nRhode Island 1 E\nTennessee 1 HC\nTexas 1 HC\n21\nCANADA 1 E\nPUERTO RICO 1 E, IT\nSERBIA 3 E, IT\n(1) Services provided are abbreviated as follows:\nE - Engineering\nHC - Specialty Health Care\nIT - Life Sciences and Information Technology\nThe Company is domiciled in the United States and its segments operate in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico\nand Serbia.\n9\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nInternational Operations\nThe Company operates its business in Canada and, to a less significant extent, in Puerto Rico and Serbia. For the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 4.4% of the Company’s revenue were generated outside the\nUnited States. There are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including: the imposition of\ntrade barriers, foreign exchange restrictions, longer payment cycles, greater difficulties in accounts receivables\ncollection, difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws (including without limitation the U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act), changes in legal or regulatory requirements, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign\noperations, complex and uncertain employment environments, political instability and potentially adverse tax\nconsequences. Our operations in Serbia could be adversely affected by the current conflict between Ukraine and\nRussia, with which Serbia has substantial ties. Should sanctions against Russia affect Russia in a way that causes\nadverse economic consequences to Serbia, or if such sanctions were to be extended to countries that might be\nconsidered to be in alignment with Russia, thus could have a negative impact on our employees or operations both\nwithin and outside Serbia. To the extent the Company experiences these risks, the business and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nFrom its headquarters locations in New Jersey, the Company provides its branch offices with centralized\nadministrative, marketing, finance, MIS, human resources and legal support. Centralized administrative functions\nminimize the administrative burdens on branch office managers and allow them to spend more time focusing on\nsales and marketing and practice development activities.\nBranch offices are primarily located in markets that the Company believes have strong growth prospects for the\nCompany’s services. The Company’s branches are operated in a decentralized, entrepreneurial manner with most\noffices operating as independent profit centers.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing efforts are conducted at the local and national level through the Company’s network of branch\noffices. Sales activities and productivity are tracked and rankings established and published. Sales between\nbusiness units are recognized and financially encouraged. The Company emphasizes long-term personal\nrelationships with customers that are developed through regular assessment of customer requirements and proactive\nmonitoring of service performance. The Company’s sales personnel make regular visits to existing and prospective\ncustomers. New customers are obtained through active sales programs and referrals. The Company encourages its\nemployees to participate in national and regional trade associations, local chambers of commerce and other civic\nassociations. The Company seeks to develop strategic partnering relationships with its customers by providing\ncomprehensive solutions for all aspects of a customer’s engineering, life sciences, information technology and other\nprofessional services needs. The Company concentrates on providing carefully screened professionals with the\nappropriate skills in a timely manner and at competitive prices. The Company regularly monitors the quality of the\nservices provided by its personnel and obtains feedback from its customers as to their satisfaction with the services\nprovided.\nThe Company serves Fortune 1000 companies and many middle market clients. The Company’s relationships with\nthese customers are typically formed at the customers’ local or regional level and from time to time, when\nappropriate, at the corporate level for national accounts.\n10\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nKey Customers\nThe Company has established long-term relationships with many of its customers across each of its business\nsegments. RCM’s emphasis on client retention has resulted in repeat business from many of its largest strategic\naccounts. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two customers exceed 10% of\nconsolidated revenue, representing 13.2% and 12.7% of consolidated revenue. The Company’s five, ten and twenty\nlargest customers accounted for approximately 43.0%, 53.7% and 67.0%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nOther Information\nSafeguards - Business, Disaster and Contingency Planning\nRCM has implemented a number of safeguards to protect the Company from various system-related risks including\nRedundant Telecommunications and server systems architecture, multi-tiered server and desktop backup\ninfrastructure, and data center physical and environmental controls. In addition, RCM has developed disaster\nrecovery / business continuity procedures for all offices.\nGiven the significant amount of data generated in the Company’s key processes including recruiting, sales, payroll\nand customer invoicing, RCM has established redundant procedures, functioning on a daily basis, within the\nCompany’s primary data center, which is a third-party Internet Data Center (“IDC”). This redundancy should\nmitigate the risks related to hardware, application and data loss by utilizing the concept of live differential backups\nof servers and desktops to Storage Area Network (SAN) devices on its backup LAN, culminating in offsite tape\nstorage at an independent facility. Controls within the data center environment ensure that all systems are\nproactively monitored and data is properly archived.\nAdditionally, RCM has contracted and brokered strategic relationships with third-party vendors to meet its recovery\nobjectives in the event of a system disruption. For example, comprehensive service level agreements for RCM’s\ndata circuits and network devices guarantee minimal outages as well as network redundancy and scalability.\nThe Company’s ability to protect its data assets against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failures,\nand facility violations is critical. To address potential cyber security threats, the Company uses a third-party mail\nmanagement service to filter all emails destined for the RCMT domain before being delivered to the corporate mail\nservers. The service has also been deployed to safeguard the enterprise from malicious internet content. The\ndeployment of virus, spam, and patch management controls extends from the perimeter network to all desktops and\nis centrally monitored and managed. In addition to the virus and malware controls, an Intrusion Protection System\n(IPS) monitors and alerts on changes in network traffic patterns as well as known hostile signatures.\nThe Company maintains a disaster recovery plan that outlines the recovery time / point objectives (RTO / RPO),\norganization structure, roles and procedures, including site addendum disaster plans for all of its key operating\noffices. Corporate IT personnel regulate the maintenance and integrity of backed-up data throughout the Company.\nThe IDC provides RCM with a robust data center environment with redundant HVAC, commercial power feeds, ten\n2000kW diesel generator sets with five 10,000-gallon, above-ground fuel oil storage tanks to provide standby power\nand dry pipe fire suppression. In addition, the IDC provides 24x7 security staffing, closed-circuit monitors, secure-\ncard key access, biometrics scanners, man traps, and alarmed doors.\n11\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nCompetition\nThe market for engineering and IT services is highly competitive and is subject to rapid change. As the market\ndemand has shifted, many software companies have adopted tactics to pursue services and consulting offerings\nmaking them direct competitors when in the past they may have been alliance partners. Primary competitors include\nparticipants from a variety of market segments, including publicly and privately held firms, systems consulting and\nimplementation firms, application software firms, service groups of computer equipment companies, facilities\nmanagement companies, general management consulting firms and staffing companies. In addition, the Company\ncompetes with its clients’ internal resources, particularly where these resources represent a fixed cost to the client.\nSuch competition may impose additional pricing pressures on the Company.\nThe Company believes its principal competitive advantages in the engineering and life sciences and information\ntechnology services market include: strong relationships with existing clients, a long-term track record with over\n1,000 clients, a broad range of services, technical expertise, knowledge and experience in multiple industry sectors,\nquality and flexibility of service, responsiveness to client needs and speed in delivering life sciences and information\ntechnology solutions.\nAdditionally, the Company competes for suitable acquisition candidates based on its differentiated acquisition\nmodel, its entrepreneurial and decentralized operating philosophy, and its strong corporate-level support and\nresources.\nSeasonality\nThe Company’s operating results can be affected by the seasonal fluctuations in client expenditures. Expenditures\nin the Engineering, Life Sciences and Information Technology segments can be negatively impacted during the first\nquarter of the year when clients are finalizing their budgets. Quarterly results generally fluctuate depending on,\namong other things, the number of billing days in a quarter and the seasonality of clients’ businesses. The business is\nalso affected by the timing of holidays and seasonal vacation patterns, generally resulting in lower revenue and gross\nprofit in the fourth quarter of each year, not considering any non-seasonal impact. Extreme weather conditions may\nalso affect demand in the first and fourth quarters of the year as certain clients’ facilities are located in geographic\nareas subject to closure or reduced hours due to inclement weather. The Company generally experiences an increase\nin its cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross profit and gross margin percentage in the first and second\nfiscal quarters of each year as a result of resetting certain state and federal employment tax rates and related salary\nlimitations. Also, the Company’s Specialty Health Care segment typically experiences a significant decline in\nrevenue due to the substantial closure of one of its largest customers, the New York City Department of Education,\nand other educational institution clients during the third quarter due to their summer recess.\nGovernment Regulations\nThe Company is a consulting firm and employment service provider and is generally subject to one or more of the\nfollowing types of government regulation: (1) regulation of the employer/employee relationship between a firm and\nits employees, including tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, benefits, workplace compliance,\nwage and hour, anti-discrimination, immigration and workers’ compensation, (2) registration, licensing, record\nkeeping and reporting requirements, and (3) federal contractor compliance. The Company believes it is in material\ncompliance with all employee related statutes.\n12\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nIntellectual Property\nManagement believes the RCM Technologies, Inc. name is extremely valuable and important to its business. The\nCompany endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights and maintain certain trademarks, trade names, service\nmarks and other intellectual property rights, including The Source of Smart Solutions®. The Company is not\ncurrently aware of any infringing uses or other conditions that would be reasonably likely to materially and\nadversely affect the Company’s use of its proprietary rights.\nHuman Capital\nOur employees and contractors (together, our \"workforce\") are the Company's most valuable resource for current\nand future success. We promote an environment that ensures safety, encourages diversity and inclusion, fosters\ngrowth and self-development, and provides meaningful work. All employees participate in our success through\nattractive and aligned rewards. Notable programs we offer to our full-time employees include:\n Compensation packages that are market competitive, taking into account the location and responsibilities of\nthe role;\n The majority of full-time, salaried employees are eligible for incentive-based compensation such as\nperformance bonuses and commissions;\n High-quality employer-sponsored health insurance;\n Access to numerous other employer-sponsored and employee-sponsored benefit plans;\n Employer 401(k) matching contributions;\n Employee stock purchase plan (at least a 15% discount to market value at the time of purchase)\nOur recruiting teams use internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we\nencourage and reward workforce referrals for open positions.\nIn addition to our comprehensive investment in our workforce success, we strive to maintain an inclusive\nenvironment that values and leverages the uniqueness of each person to the benefit of all our stakeholders. We view\nthe combination of diverse perspectives and backgrounds as a powerful force for innovation. To promote diversity\nand our core principles, we emphasize dignity, value, and equality of all members, regardless of race, color, religion,\nage, gender, or sexual orientation, through our actions and the workplace training programs we provide. We\ncontinually strive to harness the diversity of our global workforce by cultivating a climate that permits all of our\nworkforce to bring their authentic selves to work every day.\nThe health and safety of our workforce are also a top priority. We have implemented appropriate procedures and\nprecautions to ensure our workforce's continued safety and well-being. We strive to comply with all federal and\nlocal workplace laws and regulations where we do business. We are always looking for ways to exceed compliance\nstandards by utilizing continuous improvement discipline to eliminate risks in the workplace proactively.\nThe Company believes promoting engagement and empowering its workforce drives better business results. As a\nresult, the Company believes it has an \"open door\" culture whereby every member of its workforce is comfortable\nexpressing their ideas on improving the Company and its performance. Our culture has resulted in action plans at all\nlevels of the organization and drives continuous conversations on the things that matter most to our workforce and\ntheir teams.\nThe Company's employees and contractors have generally divided into four groups: 1) Nonbillable employees; 2)\nBillable salaried employees; 3) Billable hourly long-term employees; 4) Billable hourly short-term employees and\ncontractors.\nNonbillable employees are primarily full-time and salaried. These positions include but are not limited to\nexecutives, managers, general administration, finance, accounting, account managers, recruiters, credentialers,\netcetera. These employees are not billed to clients. As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed\napproximately 280 nonbillable employees. The expense for these employees is included in the Company's selling,\ngeneral, and administrative expense in its income statements.\n13\nITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nBillable salaried employees primarily include senior-level employees whose time is often billed to clients. These\nemployees tend to be long-term in nature. Many are intended to produce high utilization rates (representing the\npercentage of their time billed to clients), often in the 90% to 100% range. However, some have nonbillable\nresponsibilities such as account management, client proposal preparation, general strategy formulation, expert\ncontent generation, project controls, overseeing projects where their time is not billable, supervising billable\npersonnel, etcetera. These employees' utilization rates generally range from 20% to 90%. Most of the expense for\nbillable salaried employees are included in the Company's direct costs in its income statements.\nBillable hourly long-term employees have very high utilization, typically in the 90% to 100%. For most of these\nemployees, our goal is near 100% utilization. They are hired with the idea that we want them to work on multiple\nassignments, either in succession or simultaneously. Billable hourly short-term employees have near 100%\nutilization. They are typically hired for one assignment, and upon completion, they terminate.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our billable workforce comprised approximately 2,540 Specialty Health Care services\npersonnel, 490 Engineering and Technical personnel, and 230 Life Sciences and Information Technology personnel\nassigned by the Company to work on client projects or assignments for various periods. None of the Company's\nemployees are party to a collective bargaining agreement.\nThe Company conducts business globally but is principally concentrated in the United States, Canada,\nSerbia/Europe, and Puerto Rico. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's workforce breaks out as follows:\n United States and Puerto Rico: approximately 257 nonbillable and 3,450 billable\n Canada: approximately five nonbillable and 30 billable\n Serbia/Europe: approximately 38 nonbillable and 80 billable\nAccess to Company Information\nThe Company is a Nevada corporation organized in 1971.

RISK FACTORS\nThe Company’s business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond its control. The risk and\nuncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Set forth below is a discussion of the risks\nand uncertainties that management believes to be material to the Company.\nEconomic Trends\nAdverse global economic conditions, when they occur, may create conditions such as increases in inflation, higher\ninterest rates, a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and\nbankruptcy, and volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. Any or all of these developments can\nnegatively affect the Company’s business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways. For\nexample, current or potential customers may be unable to fund capital spending programs, new product launches of\nother similar endeavors whereby they might procure services from the Company, and therefore delay, decrease or\ncancel purchases of services or not pay or delay paying for previously purchased services. In addition, these\nconditions may cause the Company to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize existing\ndebt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for operations, investing activities (including the financing of any future\nacquisitions), or financing activities, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nGlobal Epidemics\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and endemic, and associated initiatives to reduce its spread, have at times adversely\naffected the Company’s business and financial position, and may continue to do so. The impacts described in this\nrisk factor as relating to COVID-19 could arise in the future with respect to any other global pandemics or endemics\nthat may occur.\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and\nendemic. As COVID-19 continues to present various health, business and other challenges globally, including\nsignificant impacts in the United States, we are taking a variety of measures to protect the health and safety of our\nemployees and, especially in the healthcare segment, deploying our resources, including the talents of our\nemployees, to help the communities we serve meet and overcome the current challenges. However, public and\nprivate sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as closures of schools,\nbusinesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by\ncompanies and institutions, and travel restrictions could adversely affect demand for our services and present\nchallenges to us in delivering these services. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts operations will depend on\nfuture developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of\nthe outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and endemic, and the\nactions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. These impacts on our business could have an\nadverse effect on our liquidity position and access to capital, including our ability to access our line of credit. The\nCompany can give no assurance that the line of credit will be available in the future.\nThese factors, in addition to delays in payment could continue result in significant bad debts in the near future.\nAdditionally, our operating results would be adversely affected if unexpected increases in the costs of labor and\nlabor related costs, materials, supplies and equipment used in performing services (including the impact of potential\ntariffs and COVID-19) could not be passed on to our clients.\nIn addition, we believe that to maintain or improve our financial performance we must continue to obtain service\nagreements with new clients, retain and provide new services to existing clients, achieve modest price increases on\ncurrent service agreements with existing clients and/or maintain internal cost reduction strategies at our various\noperational levels. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to sustain the internal development of managerial\npersonnel is an important factor impacting future operating results and the successful execution of our projected\ngrowth strategies. Certainly, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and could make these objective more difficult to\nattain.\n15\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nGovernment Regulations\nStaffing firms and employment service providers are generally subject to one or more of the following types of\ngovernment regulation: (1) regulation of the employer/employee relationship between a firm and its employees,\nincluding tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, benefits, workplace compliance, wage and\nhour, anti-discrimination, immigration and workers’ compensation; (2) registration, licensing, record keeping and\nreporting requirements; and (3) federal contractor compliance. Failure to comply with these regulations could result\nin the Company incurring penalties and other liabilities, monetary and otherwise.\nHighly Competitive Business\nThe staffing services and outsourcing markets are highly competitive and have limited barriers to entry. RCM\ncompetes in global, national, regional, and local markets with numerous temporary staffing and permanent\nplacement companies. Price competition in the staffing industry is significant and pricing pressures from\ncompetitors and customers are increasing. In addition, there is increasing pressure on companies to outsource\ncertain areas of their business to low cost offshore outsourcing firms. RCM expects that the level of competition\nwill remain high in the future, which could limit RCM’s ability to maintain or increase its market share or\nprofitability. Our inability to compete successfully with our competitors could adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeasonality of Business\nAs described in “Item 1. Business,” our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with reduced demand\noften occurring during the first quarter of the year when clients are finalizing their engineering and IT budgets, and\nalso during periods in which there are a substantial amount of holidays and season vacations. In particular, one of\nthe largest customers in our Specialty Health Care group, the New York City Department of Education, significantly\nreduces activity during the third quarter, when schools are closed for summer recess. Our operating results for any\ngiven period may fluctuate as a result of the timing of holidays, vacations and other events, and if we were to\nexperience unfavorable performance during periods in which we would otherwise expect to have high seasonal\ndemand, we may have limited ability to make up for such performance during periods of seasonally lower demand.\nEvents Affecting Significant Customers\nAs disclosed in “Item 1. Business,” during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two\ncustomers exceed 10% of consolidated revenue, representing 13.2% and 12.7% of consolidated revenue. The\nCompany’s five, ten and twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 43.0%, 53.7% and 67.0%,\nrespectively, of the Company’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s customers\nmay be affected by the current state of the economy or developments in the credit markets or may engage in mergers\nor similar transactions. In addition, customers may choose to reduce the business they do with RCM for other\nreasons or no reason. The Company could also be materially impacted by actions of prime contractors whereby the\nCompany derives revenue through a subcontractor relationship. Should any significant customers experience a\ndownturn in their business that weakens their financial condition or merge with another company or otherwise cease\nindependent operation, or limit their relationship with us, it is possible that the business that the customer does with\nthe Company would be reduced or eliminated, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n16\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nSubcontractors, Transit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payables Related to Construction\nManagement Contracts\nThe Company’s Engineering segment has entered into arrangements to provide construction management and\nengineering services to customers under which arrangements the Company then engages subcontractors to provide\nthe construction services. Ultimately, as a primary contractor, the Company is responsible for the nonperformance\nor negligence of its subcontractors, whom the Company requires to be adequately insured and to issue performance\nbonds for their assignment. Should a subcontractor not perform or act negligently and should there be inadequate\ninsurance or performance bonds in place, the Company might not be able to mitigate its primary liability to the\ncustomer, and the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely\naffected. In addition, while payments to subcontractors typically are due from the Company only after the Company\nreceives payment from the ultimate customer, the Company faces the risk that, should a customer not pay the\nCompany, or should a subcontractor demand payment from the Company prior to the Company’s receipt of payment\nfrom its customer, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\nDependence Upon Personnel\nThe Company’s operations depend on the continued efforts of its officers and other executive management. The\nloss of key officers and members of executive management may cause a significant disruption to the Company’s\nbusiness.\nRCM also depends on the performance and productivity of its local managers and field personnel. The Company’s\nability to attract and retain new business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service\nrendered. The loss of key managers and field personnel may also jeopardize existing client relationships with\nbusinesses that continue to use the Company’s services based upon past relationships with local managers and field\npersonnel. In order to fulfill the requirements of the Company’s customers, the Company must be able to recruit and\nretain appropriate personnel for client assignments.\n17\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nRevolving Credit Facility and Liquidity\nIf the Company were unable to borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility (see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing\nActivities”), it may adversely affect liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s\nliquidity depends on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and, from time to time, borrowings\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility with the Company’s agent lender Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania. The Company\nbelieves that Citizens Bank is liquid and is not aware of any current risk that they will become illiquid. At\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company had $8.8 million in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility outstanding\nand $1.9 million outstanding under letters of credit, with availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving\nCredit Facility of $34.3 million.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n(which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable margin,\ntypically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day\nincrements or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays\nunused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are\nrecorded as interest expense.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various\nfinancial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order to\npay dividends. At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of\nthe Credit Facility. Any failure to be in compliance could have a material adverse effect on liquidity, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations and Changes in Exchange Rates\nThe Company is exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates.\nRCM’s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations relates to operations in Canada and Serbia, principally conducted\nthrough its Canadian and Serbian subsidiaries. Exchange rate fluctuations affect the United States dollar value of\nreported earnings derived from the Canadian operations as well as the carrying value of the Company’s investment\nin the net assets related to these operations. The Company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to\nforeign operations.\nChanges in Tax Laws\nAt any time, United States federal tax laws or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be changed. As a\nresult, changes in United States federal tax laws could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition\nand business operations, and adversely impact the Company’s shareholders. At any time, tax laws in the Company’s\nother jurisdictions, Canada, Puerto Rico and Serbia, may also change. These tax law changes may have a material\nimpact on the Company’s income tax expense.\nWorkers’ Compensation and Employee Medical Insurance\nThe Company self-insures a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers’ compensation and employees’\nmedical insurance. The Company has established reserves for workers’ compensation and employee medical\ninsurance claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic independent actuarial valuations. Significant\ndifferences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Company’s future\nfinancial results.\n18\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nImproper Activities of Temporary Professionals Could Result in Damage to Business Reputation,\nDiscontinuation of Client Relationships and Exposure to Liability\nThe Company may be subject to claims by clients related to errors and omissions, misuse of proprietary information,\ndiscrimination and harassment, theft and other criminal activity, malpractice, and other claims stemming from the\nimproper activities or alleged activities of temporary professionals. There can be no assurance that current liability\ninsurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available in sufficient amounts to cover damages or other\ncosts associated with such claims.\nClaims raised by clients stemming from the improper actions of temporary professionals, even if without merit,\ncould cause the Company to incur significant expense associated with rework costs or other damages related to such\nclaims. Furthermore, such claims by clients could damage the Company’s business reputation and result in the\ndiscontinuation of client relationships.\nAcquisitions May Not Succeed\nThe Company reviews prospective acquisitions as an element of its growth strategy. The failure of any acquisition\nto meet the Company’s expectations, whether due to a failure to successfully integrate any future acquisition or\notherwise, may result in damage to the Company’s financial performance and/or divert management’s attention from\nits core operations or could negatively affect the Company’s ability to meet the needs of its customers promptly.\nInternational Operations\nThe Company operates its business in Canada and, to a less significant extent, in Puerto Rico and Serbia. For the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 4.4% of the Company’s revenue were generated outside the\nUnited States. There are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including: the imposition of\ntrade barriers, foreign exchange restrictions, longer payment cycles, greater difficulties in accounts receivables\ncollection, difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws (including without limitation the U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act), changes in legal or regulatory requirements, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign\noperations, complex and uncertain employment environments, political instability and potentially adverse tax\nconsequences. Our operations in Serbia could be adversely affected by the current conflict between Ukraine and\nRussia, with which Serbia has substantial ties. Should sanctions against Russia affect Russia in a way that causes\nadverse economic consequences to Serbia, or if such sanctions were to be extended to countries that might be\nconsidered to be in alignment with Russia, this could have a negative impact on our employees or operations both\nwithin and outside Serbia. To the extent the Company experiences these risks, the business and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nTrademarks\nManagement believes the RCM Technologies, Inc. name is extremely valuable and important to its business. The\nCompany endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights and maintain certain trademarks, trade names, service\nmarks and other intellectual property rights, including The Source of Smart Solutions®. The Company is not\ncurrently aware of any infringing uses or other conditions that would be reasonably likely to materially and\nadversely affect the Company’s use of its proprietary rights. The Company’s success depends on its ability to\nsuccessfully obtain and maintain, and prevent misappropriation or infringement of, its intellectual property, maintain\ntrade secret protection, and conduct operations without violating or infringing on the intellectual property rights of\nthird parties. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, and it is often difficult, if not\nimpossible, to predict the outcome of such litigation. If the Company is involved in an intellectual property\nlitigation, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n19\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nData Center Capacity and Telecommunication Links\nUninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), card key access, fire suppression, and environmental control systems protect\nRCM’s datacenter. All systems are monitored on a 24/7 basis with alerting capabilities via voice or email. The\ntelecommunications architecture at RCM utilizes managed private circuits from AT&T, which encompasses\nprovisioning redundancy and diversity.\nThe Company’s ability to protect its data center against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure\nand other disasters is critical to business operations. In order to provide many of its services, RCM must be able to\nstore, retrieve, process and manage large databases and periodically expand and upgrade its capabilities. Any\ndamage to the Company’s data centers or any failure of the Company’s telecommunication links that interrupts its\noperations or results in an inadvertent loss of data could adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet its\ncustomers’ needs and their confidence in utilizing the Company for future services.\nRCM’s ability to protect its data, provide services and safeguard its installations, as it relates to the IT infrastructure,\nis in part dependent on several outside vendors with whom the Company maintains service level agreements.\nCyber Security\nWe are highly dependent on information technology systems to operate our business. A breakdown, invasion,\ncorruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems by employees, others with\nauthorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. In the ordinary course\nof business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner\nto maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Additionally, we outsource certain elements of our\ninformation technology systems to third parties. As a result of this outsourcing, our third party vendors may or\ncould have access to our confidential information making such systems vulnerable. Data breaches of our\ninformation technology systems, or those of our third party vendors, may pose a risk that sensitive data may be\nexposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security\nmeasures to protect our data and information technology systems and have been informed by our third party vendors\nthat they have as well, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our\nsystems, or those of our third party vendors, that could adversely affect our business.\nEnvironmental Matters and Climate Change\nThe Company and many of its customers are subject to regulation by federal, state and international environmental\nlaws, including those relating to climate change, that are subject to rapid change, which could result in regulatory\nuncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs. There can be no assurance that the steps\nwe take to abide by applicable requirements will meet all current and future regulatory. Any failures to do so could\nresult in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, or other liabilities, that could adversely affect\nour business.\n20\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)\nData Privacy\nWe control, process, or have access to personal information regarding our own employees or employment\ncandidates, as well as that of many of our customers or other third parties. Information concerning these individuals\nmay also reside in systems controlled by third party vendors with whom we do business. The legal and regulatory\nenvironment concerning data privacy is becoming more complex and challenging, and the potential consequences of\nnon-compliance have become more severe. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and similar laws\nimpose additional compliance requirements related to the collection, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and\nretention of personal information, which can increase operating costs and resources to accomplish. Any failure to\nabide by these regulations or to protect such personal information from inappropriate access or disclosure, whether\nthrough social engineering or by accident or other cause, could have severe consequences including fines, litigation,\nregulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and loss of customers or employees. There can be no assurance that the\nsteps we take to abide by applicable requirements and protect information will meet all current and future regulatory\nrequirements, anticipate all potential methods of unauthorized access, or prevent all inappropriate disclosures. Any\nfailures to do so could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, or other liabilities, that\ncould adversely affect our business.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Company provides specialty professional consulting services, principally performed at various client locations,\nthrough 26 administrative and sales offices located in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and Serbia. The\nmajority of the Company’s offices typically consist of 1,000 to 11,000 square feet and are typically leased by the\nCompany for terms of one to five years. Offices in larger or smaller markets may vary in size from the typical\noffice. The Company does not expect that it will be difficult to maintain or find suitable lease space at reasonable\nrates in its markets or in areas where the Company contemplates expansion.\nThe Company’s executive office is located at 2500 McClellan Avenue, Suite 350, Pennsauken, New Jersey 08109-\n4613. These premises consist of approximately 3,500 square feet and are leased at a rate of approximately $15.00\nper square foot per annum for a term ending on November 30, 2025.\nThe Company’s operational office is located at 20 Waterview Boulevard, 4th Floor, Parsippany, NJ 07054-1271.\nThese premises consist of approximately 9,200 square feet and are leased at a rate of approximately $25.50 per\nsquare foot per annum for a term ending on January 31, 2024.\n21\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, the Company is a defendant in various legal actions that arise in the ordinary business course.\nThese matters may relate to professional liability, tax, compensation, contract, competitor disputes, and employee-\nrelated matters and include individual and class action lawsuits, as well as inquiries and investigations by\ngovernmental agencies regarding the Company’s employment and compensation practices. Additionally, some of\nthe Company’s clients may also become subject to claims, governmental inquiries and investigations, and legal\nactions relating to the Company’s professional services. Depending upon the particular facts and circumstances, the\nCompany may also be subject to indemnification obligations under its contracts with such clients relating to these\nmatters.\nAs such, the Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as\npotential ranges of losses and possible recoveries. The Company may not be covered by insurance as it pertains to\nsome or all of these matters. A determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments and\ncontingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each matter. The\nCompany records a liability when management believes an adverse outcome from a loss contingency is both\nprobable and the amount, or a range, can be reasonably estimated. From time to time, the Company must estimate\nthe potential loss even though the party adverse to the Company has not asserted any specific amounts. Significant\njudgment is required to determine both probability of loss and the estimated amount. The Company reviews its loss\ncontingencies at least quarterly and adjusts its accruals and/or disclosures to reflect the impact of negotiations,\nsettlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, or other new information, as deemed necessary. Once established, a\nprovision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances and could increase or\ndecrease the Company’s earnings in the period that the changes are made.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of December 31, 2022, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss has\nnot been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could result in\nan unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company believes that such\nmatters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accrued $2.9\nmillion for asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the\nCompany is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not determined if it\nhas any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually limited to an amount\nno higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found liable, any damages would be\ncovered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum coverage of $5.0 million. While the\nCompany attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has reserved $0.5 million for this project.\nThe Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3 million or that liability over $0.5 million, if\nany, will be covered by insurance.\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n22\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER\nMATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nShares of the Company’s common stock are traded on The NASDAQ Global Market under the Symbol “RCMT.”\nHolders\nAs of February 27, 2023, the approximate number of holders of record of the Company’s Common Stock was 280\nand the number of beneficial owners of its Common Stock was approximately 1,702.\nDividends\nNo dividends were declared in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2022. All restricted share awards contain a dividend equivalent\nprovision entitling holders to dividends paid between the restricted stock unit grant date and ultimate share\ndistribution date. As of December 31, 2022, there were no accrued dividends.\nWhile the Company, at this time, has no plans to issue any future dividends, any future payment of dividends will\ndepend upon, among other things, the Company’s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of\nindebtedness, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Revolving\nCredit Facility (as discussed in Item 7 hereof) prohibits the payment of any dividends or distributions on account of\nthe Company’s capital stock without the prior consent of the majority of the Company’s lenders.\nStock Repurchase by Issuer\nOn August 5, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new program to repurchase shares of the\nCommon Stock constituting, in the aggregate, up to an amount not to exceed $25.0 million. This new purchase\nprogram replaces the Company’s prior existing program to repurchase shares of the Common Stock, which was\nterminated in connection with the approval of the new program. The program is designed to provide the Company\nwith enhanced flexibility over the long term to optimize its capital structure. Shares of the Common Stock may be\nrepurchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions. The program may be terminated or suspended at\nany time at the discretion of the Company. The Company may enter into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to effect a\nportion of the authorized purchases, if criteria set forth in the plan are met. Such a plan would enable the Company\nto repurchase its shares during periods outside of its normal trading windows, when the Company typically would\nnot be active in the market. The time of purchases and the exact number of shares to be purchased will depend on\nmarket conditions. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be\nsuspended or terminated at any time. The Company intends to finance any purchases using available working capital\nand capacity from the Company’s revolving line of credit.\n23\nITEM 5.

RESERVED\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOVID-19 Considerations\nThe Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic and endemic are protecting the health and safety of our\nemployees and, especially in the healthcare segment, deploying our resources, including the talents of our\nemployees, to help the communities we serve meet and overcome the current challenges. In the future, the\npandemic and endemic may cause reduced demand for our services if, for example, the pandemic and endemic\nresults in a prolonged recessionary economic environment affecting industries in which we serve; however, since\ncertain services that we offer are essential to the daily lives of our customers, we believe that over the long term,\nthere will continue to be demand for our services.\nOur ability to continue to operate without any significant negative operational impact from the COVID-19 pandemic\nand endemic will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has\nendeavored to follow the recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees, with\nparticular measures in place for those working in our customer facilities. While our revenue, gross profit and\noperating income were negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 on a consolidated basis and in fiscal 2021 for certain\nbusiness lines, we have maintained the consistency of our operations, to a substantial degree, from the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and endemic. We intend to continue to adhere to our employee safety measures as we seek to\nensure that any disruptions to our operations remain as limited as possible during the pandemic and endemic.\nHowever, the uncertainty resulting from the pandemic and endemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our\nworkforce and supply chain (for example, an inability of a key supplier or transportation supplier to source and\ntransport materials) that could negatively impact our operations. Any material changes to labor rates for the\nCompany’s workforce may have a material negative impact to revenue, gross profit and operating income.\nFor additional information on risk factors related to the pandemic and endemic or other risks that could impact our\nresults, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. For additional information on how\nCOVID-19 has impacted operations and our financial position, please refer to the Segment Discussion and Liquidity\nand Capital Resources sections in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.\n25\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements\nrelating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements\nshould be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses matters relating to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and\nJanuary 1, 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between such fiscal years. Discussions of matters relating to the\nfiscal year ended January 2, 2021 and year-to-year comparison between that year and the year ended January 1,\n2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of RCM’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended January 1, 2022.\nOverview\nRCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the impact of\neconomic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company’s\nfinancial performance.\nThe Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven\nrecord of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to\noptimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong\nvertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.\nThe Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business\nprocesses to compete in today’s business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing\nbusiness and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses\ntoday are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact\non spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.\nNonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced life sciences,\ninformation technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they\ncan maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage.\nAlthough working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support\nincreasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a\ndemand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate\nthe potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.\nThe Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon\nfixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management\nand solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally\nendeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also\nrealizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical\nconsultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily\nprovided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company’s consultants based upon their\nskill level, experience and the type of work performed.\nThe majority of the Company’s services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the\nmore complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the\nnature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more\ncomplex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally\nterminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days’ notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically, these contracts are for less than one year. The\nCompany recognizes revenue on these deliverables at the time the client accepts and approves the deliverables.\n26\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nOverview (Continued)\nCosts of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and\nemployees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses\nconsist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating\nactivities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries\nand benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company’s corporate marketing,\nadministrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these\nexpenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the\npurpose of segment financial reporting.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity\nwith U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our consolidated financial statements, estimates are\nused for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-lived intangible\nassets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock awards, insurance liabilities, accounting for income taxes\nand accrued bonuses.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring\nservices promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive\nin exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate service\nstreams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the\ncontract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction\nprice; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize revenue when (or as)\neach performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company’s Engineering Services, Life Sciences and\nInformation Technology segments perform consulting and project solution services. The Healthcare segment\nspecializes in long-term and short-term staffing and placement services to hospitals, schools and long-term care\nfacilities amongst others. All of the Company’s segments perform staff augmentation services and derive revenue\nfrom permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company’s revenue is invoiced on a time and materials basis.\n27\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue source for the fiscal years ended December 31,\n2022 and January 1, 2022:\nDecember 31, January 1,\n2022 2022\nSpecialty Health Care:\nTime and Material $158,001 $97,363\nPermanent Placement Services 1,447 1,132\nTotal Specialty Health Care $159,448 $98,495\nEngineering:\nTime and Material $44,915 $33,937\nFixed Fee 41,021 32,168\nPermanent Placement Services 1 67\nTotal Engineering $85,937 $66,172\nLife Sciences and Information Technology:\nTime and Material $35,473 $37,181\nFixed Fee 3,022 1,390\nPermanent Placement Services 800 637\nTotal Life Sciences and Information Technology $39,295 $39,208\n$284,680 $203,875\nTime and Material\nThe Company’s Life Sciences and Information Technology and Healthcare segments predominantly recognize\nrevenue through time and material work while its Engineering segment recognizes revenue through both time and\nmaterial and fixed fee work. The Company’s time and material contracts are typically based on the number of hours\nworked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials contracts are\nrecognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed Fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts requiring\nthe completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of its customers\nthat broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements are typically\ndelivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that fixed fee project.\nWhile these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company’s fixed fee purchase orders are\ntypically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are provided on a fixed-\nprice basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain instances, revenue is\ninvoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue under these arrangements\nare recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. From time-to-time, amounts paid in excess of revenue\nearned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, some contracts contain “Performance Fees” (bonuses) for\ncompleting a contract under budget. Performance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit\nrevenue and billings to specified maximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period\nsuch losses are determined. For contracts where there is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the\nrevenue is not recognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed\nwhen the related revenue is recognized.\n28\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are\ntypically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company’s client.\nThere was $1.1 million of deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022. Deferred revenue was $3.4 million as of\nJanuary 1, 2022. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be recognized\nover a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet. In the fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $3.4 million and $0.4 million,\nrespectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the reporting period.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on evaluation\nof customers’ financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary\nand are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nAccounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its\nallowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due,\nthe Company’s previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the\ncondition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when\nthey become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables previously written off are\ncredited to bad debt expense.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350\n“Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment” (“ASC Topic 350”).\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the Company’s fiscal December\neach year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill\nmay be below its carrying amount. The Company has three reporting units. The Company uses a market-based\napproach to determine the fair value of the reporting units. This approach uses earnings/revenue multiples of similar\ncompanies recently completing acquisitions and the ability of our reporting units to generate cash flows as measures\nof fair value of our reporting units. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04,\n“Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” effective December\n29, 2018 which has eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should\nperform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.\nThere was no goodwill impairment in fiscal 2022 or 2021. During all periods presented, the Company determined\nthat the existing qualitative factors did not suggest that an impairment of goodwill exists. There can be no assurance\nthat future indicators of impairment and tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges for both\nits Engineering and Specialty Healthcare segments.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the\nCompany determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an\nasset’s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any, are\nreported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\n29\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nAccounting for Restricted Stock Awards\nThe Company uses restricted stock awards to attract, retain and reward employees for long-term service. The\nCompany follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic\n718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation” which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock-based\npayment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. This compensation cost is measured based on the\nfair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost using\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock at the\ndate of grant for restricted stock awards.\nInsurance Liabilities\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care insurance.\nThe Company establishes loss provisions based on historical experience and in the case of expected losses from\nworkers compensation, considers input from third parties. The amounts included in the Company’s costs related to\nthis risk participation are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions, the Company’s claims\nexperience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn establishing the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities and valuation\nallowances against deferred tax assets, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax\nlaws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had both\ndomestic and foreign net deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 million. The domestic long term net deferred tax liability of\n$1.5 million includes $4.0 million in deferred liabilities offset by $2.5 million in deferred tax assets. The deferred\ntax liabilities consist of acquisition amortization of $1.7 million, prepaid expenses of $0.9 million and advance\ndepreciation deductions of $0.4 million. The domestic deferred tax assets consist of lease liabilities of $1.1 million\nand various deferred expense accruals and reserves of $0.9 million. The realization of deferred tax assets is\ndependent upon the likelihood that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize these benefits over time, and\nthe effectiveness of tax planning strategies in the relevant tax jurisdictions. If actual results differ from these\nestimates and assessments, valuation allowances may be required. The Company also had $0.2 million in foreign\nnet deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company conducts its operations in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and\nSerbia. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated United States Federal income tax return and file in\nvarious states. The Company has no open Federal audits as of December 31, 2022. Except for limited exceptions,\nthe Company is no longer subject to audits by state and local tax authorities for tax years prior to 2018. The\nCompany is no longer subject to audit in Canada for the tax years prior to tax year 2018. The Company is no longer\nsubject to audit in Puerto Rico for the tax years prior to tax year 2012.\nThe Company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax\nassets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company is subject to the\nexamination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company\nregularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy\nof its provision for income taxes.\n30\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nAccrued Bonuses\nThe Company pays bonuses to certain executive management, field management and corporate employees based on,\nor after giving consideration to, a variety of financial performance measures. Bonuses for executive management,\nfield management and certain corporate employees are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first\nquarter of the following year, based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets. In addition,\nthe Company pays discretionary bonuses to certain employees, which are not related to budget performance.\nVariances in actual results versus budgeted amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore\non the estimates of the required accruals. Accordingly, the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from\nthe estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Awards\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock awards to its executives. Performance-\nbased restricted stock awards are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics as determined by\nthe Board of Directors Compensation Committee. The Company will reassess at each reporting date whether\nachievement of any performance condition is probable and would begin recognizing additional compensation cost if\nand when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company will then recognize the\nappropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and recognize the remaining\ncompensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later measurement date the Company\ndetermines that performance-based restricted stock awards deemed as likely to vest are deemed as unlikely to vest,\nthe expense recognized will be reversed. These performance-based restricted stock awards typically include\ndividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period\nbecome due and payable after the vesting period on any stock awards that actually vest, if any. Dividends for these\ngrants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheet. Dividends for performance-based restricted stock awards that ultimately\ndo not vest are forfeited.\nForward-looking Information\nThe Company’s growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending\nprograms, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering, life sciences\nand information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company’s\noperating performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, global events such as the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic and endemic also have a substantial impact on our operations and financial results. The Company\nbelieves that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings\nprovides some insulation from adverse trends. However, general economic declines could result in the need for\nfuture cost reductions or changes in strategy.\nAdditionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of\nemployment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with\nrespect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. There can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a\nsufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.\nThe consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company\ncompetes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company’s service\nlines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors\nand customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future,\nwhich could limit the Company’s ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.\n31\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended January 1, 2022\nA summary of operating results for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 is as follows (in\nthousands):\nFiscal Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2022 January 1, 2022\n% of % of\nAmount Revenue Amount Revenue\nRevenue $284,680 100.0 $203,875 100.0\nCost of services 201,753 70.9 150,751 73.9\nGross profit 82,927 29.1 53,124 26.1\nSelling, general and administrative 53,395 18.8 42,019 20.6\nDepreciation and amortization of property and\nequipment 995 0.3 1,007 0.5\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 46 0.0 95 0.1\nGain on sale of assets (219 ) (0.1 ) (2,420 ) (1.2 )\nRemeasurement of acquisition-related\ncontingent consideration (88 ) (0.0 ) (1,713 ) (0.8 )\nOperating costs and expenses 54,129 19.0 38,988 19.2\nOperating income 28,798 10.1 14,136 6.9\nOther expense, net 318 0.1 222 0.1\nIncome before income taxes 28,480 10.0 13,914 6.8\nIncome tax expense 7,591 2.7 2,925 1.4\nNet income $20,889 7.3 $10,989 5.4\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. The\nfiscal years ended December 31, 2022 (fiscal 2022) and January 1, 2022 (fiscal 2021) consisted of fifty-two weeks\neach.\nRevenue. Revenue increased 39.6%, or $80.8 million, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to\nJanuary 1, 2022 (the “comparable prior year period”). Revenue increased $60.9 million in the Specialty Health Care\nsegment, $19.8 million in the Engineering segment and $0.1 million in the Life Sciences and Information\nTechnology segment. See Segment Discussion for further information on revenue changes.\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services increased 33.8%, or $51.0 million, for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Cost of services increased primarily due to the\nincrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and\nthe comparable prior year period were 70.9% and 73.9%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further\ninformation regarding changes in cost of services and gross profit.\n32\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended January 1, 2022 (Continued)\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses were $53.4 million\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $42.0 million for the comparable prior year period. As\na percentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 18.8% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and 20.6% for the\ncomparable prior year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\nGain on sale of assets. On July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its\nPickering and Kincardine offices, located in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often referred to as Canada\nPower Systems and principally provided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The\ntwo Canada Power Systems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company’s Engineering segment. The\nCompany recorded a net gain on the sale of these assets and liabilities of $2.4 million for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 1, 2022. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a gain of $0.2 million, which\nwas due to receiving escrow funds associated with the sale of Canada Power Systems in fiscal 2021.\nRemeasurement of acquisition related contingent consideration. During both periods presented, the Company\nadjusted the forecasted contingent consideration for active acquisition agreements, which created discreet gains of\n$0.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and $1.7 million for the comparable prior year period.\nOther Expense (Income). Other expense (income) consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized\nloan costs on the Company’s line of credit, net of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency\ntransactions. Other expense (income) increased by $0.1 million as compared to the comparable prior year period,\nprimarily due to a decrease in gains on foreign currency transactions.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company recognized $7.6 million of income tax expense for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, as compared to $2.9 million for the comparable prior-year period. The consolidated effective\nincome tax rate for the current period was 26.7% as compared to 21.0% for the comparable prior-year period. The\nCompany’s tax rates for fiscal 2022 are 27.0% for the United States, 23.3% for Canada, and 16.8% for Serbia. The\nrelative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of\nthe Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income. The\neffective income tax rate can also be impacted by discrete permanent differences affecting any period presented.\nThe Company considers its 2021 effective income tax rate to be abnormally low, due mainly to permanent\ndifferences detailed in footnote 15 in the Company’s financial statements. The Company estimates its normalized\ntax rates for fiscal 2021 as 28.5% for the United States, 26.5% for Canada, and 16.5% for Serbia. Based on the fiscal\n2021 pretax income mix, the Company estimates its normalized consolidated tax rate as 27.5%.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily from the\neffect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to the Company.\nThe actual effective tax rate may vary in future years depending on the actual operating income earned in various\njurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options and vesting of share-based\nawards.\n33\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended January 1, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $159.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 increased 61.9%, or\n$60.9 million, as compared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue was driven by both the\nCompany’s school and non-school clients. Revenue from school clients for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2022 was $114.2 million as compared to $66.6 million for the comparable prior-year period. Revenue from non-\nschool clients for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was $45.2 million as compared to $31.9 million for the\ncomparable prior-year period. Revenue increases were due to the reopening of Specialty Health Care school clients\nand unprecedented demand for health care professionals across all types of clients served. The Specialty Health Care\nsegment’s gross profit increased by 89.2%, or $22.6 million, to $47.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2022, as compared to $25.3 million for the prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by\nthe increase in revenue, but also a higher gross profit margin. Gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 increased to 30.0% as compared to 25.7% for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in\ngross profit margin was primarily due to more normalized revenue and the high demand for certain services.\nSpecialty Health Care experienced operating income of $19.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022,\nas compared to $5.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. The primary reason for the increase in operating\nincome was the increase to gross profit, offset by an increase in SGA expense. SGA expense increased by $8.2\nmillion to $27.7 million, as compared to $19.5 million in the comparable prior-year period. The increase in SGA\nexpense was primarily due to increasing our workforce to help meet increased demand.\nThe Company believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic helped to increase Specialty Health Care revenue\nand gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the first half of fiscal 2022. The Company also believes the\nCOVID-19 pandemic began to shift to an endemic in the second half of fiscal 2022. As a result, COVID-19-related\nrevenue has decreased. However, the Company also believes that the demand for its Healthcare services is greater\nthan it typically had been before the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is the overall impact of these offsetting\ndynamics is uncertain, the Company believes that, except for seasonality, it is well positioned for potential growth in\nrevenue.\n34\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended January 1, 2022 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nEngineering\nEngineering revenue of $85.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 increased 29.9%, or $19.8\nmillion, compared to the comparable prior-year period. The increase in revenue was comprised of the following:\nincreases in Aerospace revenue of $16.3 million, Industrial Processing revenue of $5.3 million, and Energy Services\nrevenue of $3.1 million, offset by a decrease in revenue of $4.9 million resulting from the sale of the Canadian\nPower Systems Group. The increase in Aerospace revenue was primarily due to a new outsourcing engagement\nwith one of the Company’s long-time customers and the Company’s entrance into the burgeoning rocket industry.\nThe increase in Industrial Processing revenue was primarily due to spending increases by several major customers\nseeking to upgrade their ethanol-related production capability. Gross profit increased by 35.2%, or $5.7 million, as\ncompared to the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit increased because of the increase in revenue and an\nincrease in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin of 25.3% for the current period increased from 24.3% for the\ncomparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit margin was due to three factors: 1) decreased revenue\nfrom the Canadian Power Systems Group, as the prior-year gross profit margin associated with such revenue was\ndilutive at 21.7%; 2) improved project execution across all three of the Engineering business lines; and 3) a\nconcerted effort to improve gross profit margin through better managing of utilization and focusing on higher gross\nprofit margin opportunities. The Engineering segment’s SGA expense of $17.3 million increased by $3.1 million\ndue to investment in new personnel to reposition and generate future growth. The Engineering segment experienced\noperating income of $4.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $5.4 million for the\ncomparable prior-year period. The decrease in operating income was due to the decrease in discrete gains in the\ncurrent period. Gain on sale of assets and remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration increased\noperating income by $0.3 million in the current fiscal year as compared to increasing operating income by $4.1\nmillion in the comparable prior fiscal year.\nLife Sciences and Information Technology\nLife Sciences and Information Technology revenue of $39.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022\nincreased by $0.1 million, as compared to $39.2 million for the comparable prior-year period. Gross profit of $13.3\nmillion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 increased 13.3%, or $1.6 million, as compared to $11.7 million\nfor the comparable prior-year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to an increase in gross profit\nmargin. The Life Sciences and Information Technology gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2022 was 33.9% as compared to 30.0% for the comparable prior-year period. The Company attributes the gross\nprofit margin increase to higher revenue from its Life Sciences practice and a concerted effort to increase gross\nprofit margin through its managed service offerings. SGA expense increased to $8.5 million as compared to $8.3\nmillion in the comparable prior-year period. The Life Sciences and Information Technology segment experienced\noperating income of $4.7 million as compared to $3.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. The increase in\noperating income was primarily due to the increase in gross profit.\n35\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nSupplemental Operating Results on a Non-GAAP Basis\nThe following non-GAAP measures, which adjust for the categories of expenses described below, are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures (“Adjusted operating\nincome”, “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted net income”, and “Adjusted diluted net earnings per share”)\nare useful information for investors, shareholders and other stakeholders of our company in gauging our results of\noperations on an ongoing basis and to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance\nand period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are performance measures and\nnot liquidity measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net\nincome or operating income as indicators of performance. In addition, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA\ntakes into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash\nflows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The major components of cash used in or provided by operating\nactivities in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and the comparable prior year period are as follows: net\nincome and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable,\nprepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs,\nand deferred revenue.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company experienced net income of $20.9 million as compared to\n$11.0 million for the comparable prior year period. An increase in accounts receivables in the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, used $1.5 million of cash as compared to $14.7 million in the comparable prior year period.\nThe Company primarily attributes this increase in accounts receivables for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022\nto the increase in revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter 2022 to $70.2 million as compared to $64.9 million for fiscal\nfourth quarter 2021.\nWhile highly variable, the Company’s transit accounts payable typically exceeds the Company’s transit accounts\nreceivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course\nof business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net payable of $6.5 million as\nof December 31, 2022 as compared to a net payable of $1.1 million as of January 1, 2022, providing $5.4 million of\ncash during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets used cash of $2.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as\ncompared to providing $1.8 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes changes\nto prepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of business.\nSince certain expenses are paid before a fiscal year concludes and are amortized over the next fiscal year, prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets generally tend to increase at the end of a fiscal year and decrease during the first\nthree quarters of the following fiscal year.\nAn increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses provided cash of $4.9 million for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 as compared to $1.5 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes these\nchanges to typical fluctuations in the normal course of business.\n38\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nOperating Activities (Continued)\nChanges in accrued payroll and related costs provided negligible cash for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022\nas compared to $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022. There are four primary factors that generally\nimpact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll and\nrelated costs is the Company’s largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other\nfactors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two\nweeks and normally has thirteen weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major\npayroll on the last business day of every other quarter; 3) the timing of various payroll related payments varies in the\nnormal course of business; and 4) most of the Company’s senior management participate in annual incentive plans\nand while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent\nthey are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive\nplan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The\nCompany’s last major payroll for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was paid on December 30, 2022. During\nfiscal 2020, the Company deferred $3.3 million of employer payroll taxes under the CARES Act. Half of these\ndeferred payroll taxes were paid in fiscal December 2021 and the remaining portion was paid in fiscal December\n2022.\nHistorically, the Company has experienced small deferred revenue balances. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, the\nCompany’s Industrial Processing group secured several contracts with significant front-loaded payments, thereby\ngenerating larger deferred revenue balances than typically generated. As a result, the Company’s deferred revenue\nbalance as of December 31, 2022, was $1.1 million, compared to $3.4 million as of January 1, 2022, creating\npositive cash from operations of $2.3 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. While the Company\nexpects to receive future upfront payments from its Industrial Processing clients, the Company cannot reasonably\nforecast deferred revenue balances as the timing of contract wins and front-loaded payments are typically haphazard.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $4.8 million of cash for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and provided $6.3 million\nfor the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022. Investing activities used $0.9 million for the purchase of property and\nequipment in the current period as compared to $0.6 million in the prior year comparable period. The current year\nperiod used $4.2 million for the acquisition of TalentHerder. The prior year period includes $6.9 million in proceeds\nfor the sale of the Company’s Canadian Power Systems business.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities used $23.1 million of cash for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and $7.6 million for the\nfiscal year ended January 1, 2022. The Company made net payments under its line of credit of $5.4 million during\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to net borrowings of $2.3 million in the comparable prior year\nperiod. The Company used $17.6 million to repurchase shares of its common stock in the current period as\ncompared to $9.0 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company generated cash of $0.4 million and\n$0.1 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and the comparable prior year period,\nrespectively. The Company paid contingent consideration of $0.1 million in the current period as compared to $0.5\nmillion in the comparable prior year period.\n39\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n(which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable margin,\ntypically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day\nincrements or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays\nunused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are\nrecorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the fiscal\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were 2.2% and 2.0%, respectively. However, during the\nCompany’s fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, it experienced a weighted average interest rate of 5.6%, including unused\nline. The Company believes its fourth quarter interest rate is more reflective of rates expected in the near term.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various\nfinancial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order to\npay dividends. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the\nRevolving Credit Facility (as amended). The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its financial\ncovenants for the foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 were $8.8 million and $14.2 million,\nrespectively. At both December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 there were letters of credit outstanding for $1.9 million.\nAt December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving\nCredit Facility of $34.3 million and $28.9 million, respectively.\nIn addition to borrowings and sales of shares from its equity plans, the Company may raise capital through sales of\nshares of common stock under its at the market issuance program (the “ATM Program”) established under its May\n2021 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc., as the agent (the “Agent”). The ATM\nProgram allows the Company to offer and sell shares of the common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to\n$25.0 million from time to time through the Agent. To date, the Company has not sold any shares under the ATM\nProgram.\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations,\nand meet the other general cash needs of our business. Our liquidity is impacted by general economic, financial,\ncompetitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to\npay our expenses, principally labor-costs, and other related expenditures. We generally satisfy our liquidity needs\nthrough cash provided by operations and, when necessary, our revolving line of credit from Citizens Bank. The\nCompany believes it has a great deal of flexibility to reduce its costs if it becomes necessary. The Company believes\nthat it can satisfy its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months.\nThe Company’s liquidity and capital resources as of December 31, 2022, included accounts receivable and total\ncurrent asset balances of $50.8 million and $59.0 million, respectively. Current liabilities were $40.4 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and were exceeded by total current assets by $18.6 million.\n40\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCurrent Liquidity and Revolving Credit Facility (Continued)\nThe Company experiences volatility in its daily cash flow and, at times, relies on the revolving line of credit to\nprovide daily liquidity for the Company’s financial operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in\ncompliance with all financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that it\nwill maintain compliance with its financial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nDividends\nAll restricted share awards contain a dividend equivalent provision entitling holders to dividends paid between the\nrestricted stock unit grant date and ultimate share distribution date. As of December 31, 2022, there were no\naccrued dividends.\nWhile the Company, at this time, has no plans to issue any future dividends, any future payment of dividends will\ndepend upon, among other things, the Company’s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of\nindebtedness, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Revolving\nCredit Facility (as discussed above) prohibits the payment of any dividends or distributions on account of the\nCompany’s capital stock without the prior consent of the majority of the Company’s lenders.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes.\nFunding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from\none or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or\nfuture financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time\nin the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final\noutcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the\nresults of operations.\nThe Company’s business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through\nstrategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates.\nThe Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally\nincluded significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase\nhowever, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such\nopportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No\nassurance can be given as to the Company’s future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such\nopportunities will be financed.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of December 31, 2022, where the Company believes it has a\nprobability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of loss has\nnot been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims could result in\nan unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company believes that such\nmatters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accrued $2.9\nmillion for asserted claims.\n41\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCommitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by the\nCompany is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not determined if it\nhas any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually limited to an amount\nno higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found liable, any damages would be\ncovered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum coverage of $5.0 million. While the\nCompany attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has reserved $0.5 million for this project.\nThe Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3 million or that liability over $0.5 million, if\nany, will be covered by insurance.\nThe Company is also subject to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of its business, which may not be covered by insurance.\nThe Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in\n1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company is currently\nimplementing an upgrade of its current system and expects to go live in 2024. The Company estimates this upgrade\nor replacement of its financial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\nThese estimates are subject to material change.\nThe Company’s current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes\nthat its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of\nbusiness for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates\nthrough November 2027. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nOperating Finance\nFiscal Year Leases Leases\n2023 $1,460 $467\n2024 754 233\n2025 493 -\n2026 409 -\n2027 302 -\nThereafter 1,455 -\nTotal lease payments 4,873 700\nLess: imputed interest (592 ) (6 )\nTotal $4,281 $694\n42\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets of\nThermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, “TKE”), and 2) effective\nOctober 2, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates future\ncontingent payments at December 31, 2022 as follows:\nFiscal Years Ending Total\nDecember 30, 2023 $472\nThereafter 1,970\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $2,442\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of December 31, 2022. Contingent\nconsideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other\n(expense) income, net.\nSignificant employment agreements are as follows:\nExecutive Severance Agreements\nThe Company is a party to an Executive Severance Agreement (the “Executive Severance Agreement”) with each of\nBradley S. Vizi, the Company's Executive Chairman and President (dated as of June 1, 2018), and Kevin D. Miller,\nthe Company’s Chief Financial Officer (dated as of February 28, 2014, as amended), which set forth the terms and\nconditions of certain payments to be made by the Company to the executive in the event, while employed by the\nCompany, such executive experiences (a) a termination of employment unrelated to a “Change in Control” (as\ndefined therein) or (b) there occurs a Change in Control and either (i) the executive’s employment is terminated for a\nreason related to the Change in Control or (ii) in the case of Mr. Miller, the executive remains continuously\nemployed with the Company for a period of three months following the Change in Control.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if either (a) the executive is involuntarily terminated by the\nCompany for any reason other than “Cause” (as defined therein), “Disability” (as defined therein) or death, or (b)\nthe executive resigns for “Good Reason” (as defined therein), and, in each case, the termination is not a\n“Termination Related to a Change in Control” (as defined below), the executive will receive the following severance\npayments: (i) an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of (a) the executive’s annual base salary as in effect immediately\nprior to the termination date (before taking into account any reduction that constitutes Good Reason) (“Annual Base\nSalary”) and (b) the highest annual bonus paid to the executive in any of the three fiscal years immediately\npreceding the executive’s termination date (“Bonus”), to be paid in installments over the twelve month period\nfollowing the executive’s termination date; and (ii) for a period of eighteen months following the executive’s\ntermination date, a monthly payment equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the executive is required to pay to\ncontinue medical, vision, and dental coverage, for himself and, where applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents.\n43\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments (Continued)\nExecutive Severance Agreements (Continued)\nNotwithstanding the above, if the executive has a termination as described above and can reasonably demonstrate\nthat such termination would constitute a Termination Related to a Change in Control, and a Change in Control\noccurs within 120 days following the executive’s termination date, the executive will be entitled to receive the\npayments set forth below for a Termination Related to a Change in Control, less any amounts already paid to the\nexecutive, upon consummation of the Change in Control.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if a Change in Control occurs and (a) the executive\nexperiences a Termination Related to a Change in Control on account of (i) an involuntary termination by the\nCompany for any reason other than Cause, death, or Disability, (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company\nwithin a specified period of time following a Change in Control (12 months for Mr. Vizi and three months for Mr.\nMiller) on account of Disability or death, or (iii) a resignation by the executive with Good Reason; or (b) in the case\nof Mr. Miller, the executive resigns, with or without Good Reason, which results in a termination date that is the last\nday of the three month period following the Change in Control, then the executive will receive the following\nseverance payments: (1) a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of the executive’s (a) Annual Base Salary\nand (b) Bonus; and (2) a lump sum payment equal to 24 multiplied by the monthly COBRA premium cost, as in\neffect immediately prior to the executive’s termination date, for the executive to continue medical, dental and vision\ncoverage, as applicable, in such Company plans for himself and, if applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents.\nUpon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall establish an irrevocable rabbi trust and contribute to\nthe rabbi trust the applicable amounts due under the Executive Severance Agreement. If Mr. Miller receives the\nChange in Control Payment following his resignation at the end of the three month period following the Change in\nControl, he will not be eligible to receive any severance payments under his Executive Severance Agreement.\nMr. Miller’s Executive Severance Agreement provides that if Mr. Miller remains continuously employed for three\nmonths following a Change in Control and is employed by the Company on the last day of such specified period,\nMr. Miller will receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus\n(the “Change in Control Payment”). If Mr. Miller receives the Change in Control Payment, he will not be eligible to\nreceive any severance payments under his Executive Severance Agreement.\nMr. Saks, along with several other members of the Company’s senior management (not including Mr. Vizi and Mr.\nMiller), is covered by our Change in Control Plan for Selected Executive Management (the “CIC Plan”).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nImpact of Inflation\nConsulting, staffing, and project services are generally priced based on mark-ups on prevailing rates of pay, and as a\nresult are able to generally maintain their relationship to direct labor costs. Permanent placement services are priced\nas a function of salary levels of the job candidates.\nThe Company’s business is labor intensive; therefore, the Company has a high exposure to increasing health care\nbenefit costs. The Company attempts to compensate for these escalating costs in its business cost models and\ncustomer pricing by passing along some of these increased health care benefit costs to its customers and employees,\nhowever, the Company has not been able to pass on all increases. The Company is continuing to review its options\nto further control these costs, which the Company does not believe are representative of general inflationary trends.\nOtherwise, inflation has not been a meaningful factor in the Company’s operations.\n44\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-\n13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses\nfor assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the FASB issued\nASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to SEC\nParagraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date\nRelated to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which amends the effective date of the\noriginal pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for the\nCompany for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company believes\nthe adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial instruments, but it does not anticipate a material\nimpact on results of operations. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on\nits consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects\nof Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This standard only applies to contracts and other transactions that\nreference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to\nreference rate reform. This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to accounting guidance\non contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease entities’ financial reporting burdens as the market transitions\nfrom the LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. In December 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the sunset date of Topic 848. This update defers the sunset date from December 31,\n2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December\n31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment\nportfolio and debt instruments, which primarily consist of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company does not\nhave any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio. The Company places its investments in instruments that\nmeet high credit quality standards. The Company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation\nof its invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany’s investments consisted of cash and money market funds. The Company does not use interest rate\nderivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the Company’s variable-rate line of\ncredit balances during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, if the interest rate on the Company’s variable-rate\nline of credit (using an incremental borrowing rate) during the period had been 1.0% higher, the Company’s interest\nexpense on an annualized basis would have increased by $0.1 million. The Company does not expect any material\nloss with respect to its investment portfolio.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements, together with the report of the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm, begins on page F-1.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\n45\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated,\nas of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the \"Exchange Act\")). Based on our evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule(s)\n13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of December 31, 2022, because of the\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements\nwill not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As described below, management identified the following\ncontrol deficiencies that resulted in material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe Company did not design and maintain information technology controls relevant to preparing its financial\nstatements, specifically concerning (i) separation of duties to the SAP ERP and General Ledger. (ii) adequate\nrestriction of administrator-type access to SAP (iii) program change management controls, and (iv) user access\ncontrols that ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user access to financial applications,\nprograms, and data. As a result, the Company's related process-level IT-dependent manual and automated controls\nthat rely upon the affected ITGCs, or information coming from IT systems with affected ITGCs, were also deemed\nineffective.\nThis material weakness did not result in a misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements.\nHowever, the material weakness could result in a misstatement of substantially all account balances or disclosures\nthat would result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not\nbe prevented or detected. Notwithstanding the above-identified material weaknesses, management believes the\nconsolidated financial statements, as included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, present the\nCompany's financial condition and results of operations fairly, in all material respects.\nPlanned Material Weakness Remediation Activities\nTo address these material weaknesses, we have commenced actions to formalize the Company's framework and\npolicies to maintain evidence in the operation of control procedures and improve our IT general controls.\nOur planned remediation efforts related to the above-identified material weaknesses include, but are not limited to:\n Investments to upgrade or replace existing systems that do not have the appropriate infrastructure to meet\nthe requirements of our internal control framework;\n Expand the available resources at the Company with experience designing and implementing control\nactivities, including information technology general controls, through hiring and use of third-party\nconsultants and specialists;\n Assess segregation of duties and implement an annual user access review, including role design and\nprocess transformation to appropriately mitigate significant risks associated with conflicting responsibilities\nin financial systems;\n Design and implement IT controls in change management that will ensure all changes are tested in staging,\napproved, and documented, and ensure that developers cannot deploy their own code to production;\n Perform additional training to ensure a clear understanding of risk assessment, controls, and monitoring\nactivities related to automated processes, systems, and ITGCs related to financial reporting.\n46\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (CONTINUED)\nPlanned Material Weakness Remediation Activities (Continued)\nWe will continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and take steps to\nremediate the known material weaknesses expeditiously. The implementation of these remediation efforts is in\nprogress, may require additional expenditures to implement, and will require validation and testing of the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles, and as a result, the\ntiming of when we will be able to remediate the material weaknesses fully is uncertain. We may also conclude that\nadditional measures may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting, which may necessitate further implementation and evaluation time.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the material weaknesses and remediation efforts described above, there have been no changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that\noccurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of\nits operations and its cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission and our report dated March 16, 2023, expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that responds to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nF-2\nRevenue Recognition – Fixed-Price Contracts\nDescription of the Matter\nAs disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generally recognizes revenue over time as\nperformance obligations are satisfied. For fixed price contracts, the Company generally measures its progress to\ncompletion using an input measure of total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred. Recognition of\nrevenue and profit over time as performance obligations are satisfied is highly judgmental as it required the Company to\nprepare estimates of total contract revenue and total contract costs, including costs to complete contracts that are in\nprocess. These estimates are dependent on a number of subjective factors and involve judgment as changes in these\nassumptions could have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized.\nAudit Response:\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the timing\nof revenue recognition, including testing the internal controls over the proper accumulation of labor costs by contract as\nwell as the approval of monthly and weekly invoices for accuracy and completeness and reviewing key provisions and\ndeliverables within customer contracts. We evaluated management’s application of their revenue recognition policies in\nthe determination of revenue recognition conclusions. Our audit procedures included, among other, selecting a sample of\nrevenue transactions and performing the following procedures: we reviewed the signed contract; we reviewed the\nrecorded timesheet data related to the selected invoices, which corroborated management's assessment towards the\ncompletion of the performance obligation; and we reviewed the signed contract related to the selected invoice, noting\neach task has an agreed upon unit price per contract and the unit price matched what was shown on the invoice. We also\ntested for proper revenue recognition cut off.\nBusiness Combination\nDescription of the Matter\nAs disclosed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, effective October 2, 2022, the Company acquired the\nbusiness operations of TalentHerder, LLC (“TalentHerder”). The Company applied the acquisition method of\naccounting for the TalentHerder business combination. This methodology requires the Company to record assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Any amount of the purchase\nprice paid that is in excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In connection\nwith the TalentHerder acquisition the Company also recorded a liability for contingent consideration related to purchase\nprice payable upon the achievement of future sales to a specific customer. We identified the Company's business\ncombination as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and judgment in determining the fair values\nassigned to certain of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially those considering management’s assumptions\nsurrounding estimated future cash flows. The Company determines fair value using widely accepted valuation\ntechniques, primarily discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses require assumptions\nand estimates regarding industry and economic factors, the profitability of future business strategies, discount rates, net\nsales growth rates, gross margins, operating expenses, income and future cash flows.\nF-3\nAudit Response:\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over to\nestimate the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and ensure the accuracy of key data used in their fair\nvalue calculations. We also evaluated the design of key controls used by management to develop their fair value\nestimate. We evaluated the appropriateness of specific key inputs supporting management’s estimate, including the net\nsales growth rates, gross margins, operating expenses, income and future cash flows. Additionally, with the assistance of\nour internal valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of unobservable inputs such as weighted average cost\nof capital, discount rates, future revenue growth, future margin amounts, and terminal values.\n/s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2022.\nRed Bank, New Jersey\nMarch 16, 2023\nPCAOB ID Number 100\nF-4\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nRCM Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited RCM Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because of the effect\nof the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has\nnot maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in\nmanagement’s assessment in section “Item 9A” Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nManagement has identified that the Company did not design and maintain information technology controls relevant to\npreparing its financial statements, specifically concerning (i) separation of duties to the SAP ERP and General Ledger.\n(ii) adequate restriction of administrator-type access to SAP (iii) program change management controls, and (iv) user\naccess controls that ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user access to financial applications,\nprograms, and data. As a result, the Company's related process-level IT-dependent manual and automated controls that\nrely upon the affected ITGCs, or information coming from IT systems with affected ITGCs, were also deemed\nineffective.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2022, and the related notes. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature,\ntiming and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does\nnot affect our report, dated March 16, 2023, on the consolidated financial statements, which expressed an unqualified\nopinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nF-5\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC\nRed Bank, New Jersey\nMarch 16, 2023\nF-6\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nRCM Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RCM Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the\n“Company\") as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations,\ncomprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended January 1, 2022 and\nJanuary 2, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 1, 2022\nand January 2, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended January 1, 2022 and January\n2, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business and Basis of Presentation\nRCM Technologies, Inc. (the “Company” or “RCM”) is a premier provider of business and technology\nsolutions designed to enhance and maximize the operational performance of its customers through the\nadaptation and deployment of advanced engineering, life sciences and information technology services.\nAdditionally, the Company provides specialty health care staffing services through its Specialty Health Care\nServices group. RCM’s offices are primarily located in major metropolitan centers throughout North America.\nThe consolidated financial statements are comprised of the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers its holdings of highly liquid money-market instruments and certificates of deposit to be\ncash equivalents if the securities mature within 90 days from the date of acquisition. These investments are\ncarried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company has significant cash balances at financial\ninstitutions, which, throughout the year, regularly exceed the federally insured limit of $250. Any loss incurred\nor lack of access to uninsured funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company held $79, $21 and $42 of cash and cash equivalents in Canadian banks as of December 31, 2022,\nJanuary 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively, which was held principally in Canadian dollars. The\nCompany held $203, $169 and $246 of cash and cash equivalents in Serbian banks as of December 31, 2022,\nJanuary 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively, which was held in various currencies. The Company held\n$16, $2 and $6 of cash and cash equivalents in Netherlands banks as of December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022\nand January 2, 2021, respectively, which was held in various currencies.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s carrying value of financial instruments, consisting primarily of accounts receivable, transit\naccounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, transit accounts payable and borrowings under\nline of credit approximates fair value due to their liquidity or their short-term nature and the line of credit’s\nvariable interest rate. The Company does not have derivative products in place to manage risks related to\nforeign currency fluctuations for its foreign operations or for interest rate changes.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on\nevaluation of customers’ financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable\npayment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an\nallowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due.\nThe Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade\naccounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its\nobligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The\nCompany writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received\non such receivables previously written off are credited to bad debt expense.\nF-13\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nUnbilled Accounts Receivable and Work-in-Process\nUnbilled receivables primarily represent revenue earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the\nbalance sheet ending date. Work-in-process primarily represents revenue earned under contracts which the\nCompany is contractually precluded from invoicing until future dates as project milestones are realized. See\nNote 4 for further details.\nTransit Accounts Receivable and Transit Accounts Payable\nFrom time to time, the Company’s Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things,\nconstruction management and engineering services. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may engage\nsubcontractors to provide construction or other services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project\nvalue; and c) assumes no ownership or risks of inventory. In such situations, the Company acts as an agent\nunder the provisions of FASB ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and therefore recognizes\nrevenue on a “net-basis.” The Company records revenue on a “net” basis on relevant engineering and\nconstruction management projects, which require subcontractor/procurement costs or transit costs. In those\nsituations, the Company charges the client a negotiated fee, which is reported as net revenue when earned.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, the Company is typically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the\ncorresponding payment from the Company’s end-client is received. Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of\nthe subcontractor or staffing agency, the Company records this amount simultaneously as both a “transit\naccount receivable” and “transit account payable,” as the amount when paid to the Company is due to and\ngenerally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The Company typically does not pay a given transit\naccount payable until the related transit account receivable is collected. The Company is typically obligated to\npay the subcontractor or staffing agency whether or not the client pays the Company. The Company’s transit\naccounts payable generally exceeds the Company’s transit accounts receivable but absolute amounts and\nspreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, and are depreciated\nor amortized on the straight-line method at rates calculated to provide for retirement of assets at the end of their\nestimated useful lives. Computer hardware and software, and furniture and office equipment are typically\ndepreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the\nasset or the lease term.\nF-14\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s intangible assets have been generated through acquisitions. The Company maintains\nresponsibility for valuing and determining the useful life of intangible assets. As a general rule, the Company\namortizes restricted covenants over four years and customer relationships over six years. However,\ncircumstances may dictate other amortization terms as determined by the Company and assisted by their third\nparty advisors.\nCanadian Sales Tax\nThe Company is required to charge and collect sales tax for all Canadian clients and remits invoiced sales tax\nmonthly to the Canadian taxing authorities whether collected or not. The Company does not collect the sales\ntax from its clients until they have paid their respective invoices. The Company includes uncollected Canadian\nsales tax invoiced to clients in its prepaid and other current assets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with FASB ASC 350\n“Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.” The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the\nlast day of the Company’s fiscal December each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances\nchange indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. The Company has three\nreporting units. The Company uses a market-based approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units.\nThis approach uses earnings/revenue multiples of similar companies recently completing acquisitions and the\nability of our reporting units to generate cash flows as measures of fair value of our reporting units. The\nCompany adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic\n350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” effective December 30, 2017 which has eliminated Step 2\nfrom the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by\ncomparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. To satisfy the “Step 0 Test”, the Company\nreviewed industry and market conditions, reporting unit specific events as well as overall financial performance\nand found no impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge in fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1,\n2022 and January 2, 2021. There can be no assurance that future indicators of impairment and tests of goodwill\nimpairment will not result in an impairment charge.\nF-15\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When\nthe Company determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover\nan asset’s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any,\nare reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company’s intangible assets\nconsist of customer relationships and non-compete agreements.\nSoftware\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 350-40 “Accounting for Internal Use Software,” certain costs related to the\ndevelopment or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of\nthe software. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the\nCompany capitalized $282, $1,256 and $305, respectively, for software costs. The net balance after\naccumulated depreciation for all software costs capitalized as of December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and\nJanuary 2, 2021 was $977, $1,350 and $1,389, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws, published tax guidance, as well\nas estimates of future earnings. These judgments and interpretations affect the provision for income taxes,\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance. The Company evaluated the deferred tax assets\nand determined on the basis of objective factors that the net assets will be realized through future years’ taxable\nincome. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates and assessments, additional valuation\nallowances may be required. The Company did not have any valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022,\nJanuary 1, 2022 or January 2, 2021.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ACS 740 “Income Taxes” (FASB ASC 740)\nwhich requires an asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires\nassessment of the likelihood of realizing benefits associated with deferred tax assets for purposes of determining\nwhether a valuation allowance is needed for such deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are\nmeasured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the\nperiod that such tax rate changes are enacted. The Company measures its deferred tax assets and liabilities\nusing the tax rates that the Company believes will apply in the years in which the temporary differences are\nexpected to be recovered or paid. The Company and its wholly owned United States subsidiaries file a\nconsolidated federal income tax return. The Company also files tax returns in Canada, Puerto Rico and Serbia.\nThe Company also follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740 which prescribes a model for the recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and provides guidance on\nderecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure and transition. The Company’s policy is to\nrecord interest and penalty, if any, as interest expense.\nF-16\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring\nservices promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to\nreceive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate\nservice streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the\ncontract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the\ntransaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize\nrevenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Healthcare segment specializes in long-term and\nshort-term staffing and placement services to hospitals, schools and long-term care facilities amongst others.\nThe Company’s Engineering Services, Life Sciences and Information Technology segments perform consulting\nand project solution services. All of the Company’s segments perform staff augmentation services and derive\nrevenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company’s revenue is invoiced on a time and\nmaterials basis.\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue source for the fiscal years ended December\n31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021:\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nSpecialty Health Care:\nTime and Material $158,001 $97,363 $59,692\nPermanent Placement Services 1,447 1,132 789\nTotal Specialty Health Care $159,448 $98,495 $60,481\nEngineering:\nTime and Material $44,915 $33,937 $28,323\nFixed Fee 41,021 32,168 29,181\nPermanent Placement Services 1 67 211\nTotal Engineering $85,937 $66,172 $57,715\nLife Sciences and Information Technology:\nTime and Material $35,473 $37,181 $31,263\nFixed Fee 3,022 1,390 460\nPermanent Placement Services 800 637 490\nTotal Life Sciences and Information Technology $39,295 $39,208 $32,213\n$284,680 $203,875 $150,409\nF-17\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nTime and Material\nThe Company’s Healthcare Life Sciences and Information Technology segments predominantly recognize\nrevenue through time and material work while its Engineering segment recognizes revenue through both time\nand material and fixed fee work. The Company’s time and material contracts are typically based on the number\nof hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials\ncontracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed Fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts\nrequiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of\nits customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements\nare typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that\nfixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company’s fixed fee\npurchase orders are typically performed over six to nine month periods. In instances where project services are\nprovided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain\ninstances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue\nunder these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. From time-to-time,\namounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAdditionally, some contracts contain “Performance Fees” (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget.\nPerformance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified\nmaximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined.\nFor contracts where there is a specific deliverable and the work is not complete and the revenue is not\nrecognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the\nrelated revenue is recognized.\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are\ntypically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company’s client. The\nCompany guarantees its permanent placements on a prorated basis for 90 days. In the event a candidate is not\nretained for the 90-day period, the Company will provide a suitable replacement candidate. In the event a\nreplacement candidate cannot be located, the Company will provide a prorated refund to the client. An\nallowance for refunds, based upon the Company’s historical experience, is recorded in the financial statements.\nPermanent placement revenue was $2.2 million, $1.8 million and $1.5 million for the fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively.\nThe deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 was $1.1 million,\n$3.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. These amounts are included in accounts payable and accrued\nexpense in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at that date. Revenue is recognized when the service\nhas been performed. Deferred revenue may be recognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it\nwas recorded on the balance sheet, although this is an infrequent occurrence. In fiscal years ended December\n31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $3.4 million, $0.4 million\nand $0.4 million, respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period.\nF-18\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nTransit Receivables and Transit Payables\nFrom time to time, the Company’s Engineering segment enters into agreements to provide, among other things,\nconstruction management and engineering services. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company a) may engage\nsubcontractors to provide construction or other services; b) typically earns a fixed percentage of the total project\nvalue; and c) assumes no ownership or risks of inventory. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company is\ntypically not required to pay the subcontractor until after the corresponding payment from the Company’s end-\nclient is received. Upon invoicing the end-client on behalf of the subcontractor or staffing agency, the Company\nrecords this amount simultaneously as both a “transit account receivable” and “transit account payable,” as the\namount when paid to the Company is due to and generally paid to the subcontractor within a few days. The\nCompany typically does not pay a given transit account payable until the related transit account receivable is\ncollected. The Company is typically obligated to pay the subcontractor or staffing agency whether or not the\nclient pays the Company. The Company’s transit accounts payable generally exceeds the Company’s transit\naccounts receivable but absolute amounts and spreads fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the\nnormal course of business. The transit accounts receivable was $3.3 million and related transit accounts\npayable was $9.8 million, for a net payable of $6.5 million, as of December 31, 2022. The transit accounts\nreceivable was $1.0 million and related transit accounts payable was $2.1 million, for a net payable of $1.1\nmillion, as of January 1, 2022. The transit accounts receivable was $2.5 million and related transit accounts\npayable was $4.9 million, for a net payable of $2.4 million, as of January 2, 2021.\nConcentrations\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two customers exceed 10% of consolidated\nrevenue, representing 13.2% and 12.7% of consolidated revenue, respectively. During the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 1, 2022, no client accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue. During the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 2, 2021, one customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue, representing 10.6%. All customers\nexceeding 10% of consolidated revenue during the periods presented are included in the Company’s Specialty\nHealth Care segment.\nThe Company’s five, ten and twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 43.0%, 53.7% and 67.0%,\nrespectively, of the Company’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s five, ten\nand twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 35.8%, 52.5% and 65.1%, respectively, of the\nCompany’s revenue for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022. The Company’s five, ten and twenty largest\ncustomers accounted for approximately 33.4%, 46.6% and 60.7%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue for\nthe fiscal year ended January 2, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, two clients represented more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, net,\nrepresenting 16.1% and 12.5%, respectively. As of January 1, 2022, two clients represented more than 10% of\nthe Company’s accounts receivable, net, representing 15.3% and 14.2%. As of January 2, 2021, two clients\nrepresented more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, net, representing 11.8% and 10.6%,\nrespectively.\nF-19\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company’s Canadian and Serbian subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and\nliabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at weighted\naverage rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Any translation adjustments are included in the\naccumulated other comprehensive income account in stockholders’ equity. Transactions executed in different\ncurrencies resulting in exchange adjustments are translated at spot rates and resulting foreign exchange\ntransaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income consists of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nPer Share Data\nBasic net income per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common\nshares plus dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common shares\nconsist of stock options and other stock-based awards under the Company’s stock compensation plans, when\ntheir impact is dilutive. Because of the Company’s capital structure, all reported earnings pertain to common\nshareholders and no other adjustments are necessary.\nShare - Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation over the vesting period of an award based on fair value at\nthe grant date determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Certain assumptions are used to\ndetermine the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant and require subjective judgment.\nBecause employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and\nbecause changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models may\nnot provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options. Management assesses the\nassumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock-based compensation when share-\nbased awards are granted. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time,\nwhich could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair\nvalue determination. If an employee leaves the firm before the vesting period has been met, those shares are\nforfeited and removed from the share – based compensation expense calculation. See Note 11 for additional\nshare-based compensation information.\nRestricted share awards are recognized at their fair value. The amount of compensation cost is measured on the\ngrant date fair value of the equity instrument issued. The compensation cost of the restricted share awards is\nrecognized over the vesting period of the restricted share awards on a straight-line basis. Restricted share\nawards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company\nduring the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period assuming the grantee’s restricted\nstock unit fully vests. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Dividends for\nrestricted share awards that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nF-20\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expense was $925, $914 and $800 for the fiscal\nyears ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company values its financial assets and liabilities based on the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In\norder to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy was\nestablished that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad\nlevels, which are described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for\nidentical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;\nquoted prices in inactive markets; or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are\nobservable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy\ngives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nIn determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs\nand minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk\nin its assessment of fair value.\nReclassification\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These\nclassifications had no effect on the previously reported results of operations.\n2. FISCAL YEAR\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31.\nThe fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 (fiscal 2022) and January 1, 2022 (fiscal 2021) consisted of fifty-two\nweeks each. The fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 (fiscal 2020) was a 53-week reporting year.\nF-21\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

USE OF ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nThe Company uses estimates to determine an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable,\nlitigation, medical claims, vacation, goodwill impairment, if any, equity compensation, the tax rate applied and\nthe valuation of certain assets and liability accounts. In addition, the Company reviews its estimated costs to\ncomplete a contract and adjusts those costs when necessary. These estimates can be significant to the operating\nresults and financial position of the Company. The estimates are based upon various factors including current\nand historical trends, as well as other pertinent industry and regulatory authority information. Management\nregularly evaluates this information to determine if it is necessary to update the basis for its estimates and to\nadjust for known changes.\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care\ninsurance. The amounts included in the Company’s costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can\nvary based on changes in assumptions, the Company’s claims experience or the providers included in the\nassociated insurance programs.\nThe Company can be affected by a variety of factors including uncertainty relating to the performance of the\ngeneral economy, competition, demand for the Company’s services, adverse litigation and claims and the\nhiring, training and retention of key employees.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s carrying value of financial instruments, consisting primarily of accounts receivable, transit\naccounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, transit accounts payable and borrowings under\nline of credit approximates fair value due to their liquidity or their short-term nature and the line of credit’s\nvariable interest rate. The Company does not have derivative products in place to manage risks related to\nforeign currency fluctuations for its foreign operations or for interest rate changes.\nThe Company re-measures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period and any\nchange in the fair value from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, is\nrecorded in earnings in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nF-22\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, TRANSIT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND TRANSIT ACCOUNTS\nPAYABLE\nThe Company’s accounts receivable are comprised as follows:\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nBilled $40,256 $37,396 $25,926\nUnbilled 6,615 10,231 8,219\nWork-in-progress 4,991 1,810 3,612\nAllowance for sales discounts and doubtful accounts (1,100 ) (1,197 ) (1,750 )\nAccounts receivable, net $50,762 $48,240 $36,007\nUnbilled receivables primarily represent revenue earned whereby those services are ready to be billed as of the\nbalance sheet ending date. Work-in-progress primarily represents revenue earned under contracts which the\nCompany contractually invoices at future dates.\n5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment are comprised of the following:\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nComputers and systems $4,077 $4,133 $4,686\nEquipment and furniture 220 86 264\nLeasehold improvements 267 159 236\nLaboratory equipment 67 - -\n4,630 4,378 5,185\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization 2,532 2,439 3,107\nProperty and equipment, net $2,098 $1,939 $2,078\nThe Company periodically writes off fully depreciated and amortized assets.

In addition, $713 of assets not fully depreciated were\nincluded in the sale of the Canadian Power Systems business. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022,\nJanuary 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was\n$995, $1,007 and $1,065, respectively.\nF-23\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nThe purchase method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 805, “Business Combination,” was applied\nfor all acquisitions. This requires the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the tangible and identifiable\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition\nwith the excess cost accounted for as goodwill. Goodwill arising from the acquisitions is attributable to\nexpected sales synergies from combining the operations of the acquired business with those of the Company.\nTalentHerder Acquisition\nEffective October 2, 2022, the Company acquired the business operations of TalentHerder, LLC, a California\nlimited liability company. TalentHerder is a leading talent acquisition services company. TalentHerder’s\nbusiness bridges the gap between in-house and external recruiting, specializing in high-growth companies. It\nworks with clients to help identify and hire top-quality talent across all critical functions, enabling companies to\nscale teams quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively. TalentHerder’s proven recruitment processes can help\nscale both in-person and remote working environments for companies across the globe. The acquisition will\nbolster the Company’s existing capabilities by expanding its recruitment process outsourcing (\"RPO\") service\nfootprint, enhancing the Company's candidate sourcing reach, and enabling the Company's in-house recruiting\nteam to respond more rapidly to client needs.\nThe preliminary consideration and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:\nCash $4,150\nCommon stock of the Company 631\nContingent consideration, at fair value 1,927\nTotal consideration $6,708\nThe seller of TalentHerder is eligible to receive post-closing contingent consideration upon the business\nexceeding certain base levels of operating income, potentially earned over five years. The amount recorded for\nthe contingent consideration represents the acquisition date fair value of expected consideration to be paid based\non TalentHerder’s forecasted operating income during the five year period. Expected consideration was valued\nbased on different possible scenarios for projected operating income. Each case was assigned a probability\nwhich was used to calculate an estimate of the forecasted future payments. Then a discount rate was applied to\nthese forecasted future payments to determine the acquisition date fair value to be recorded. The preliminary\nestimated purchase price has been allocated as follows:\nProperty and equipment, net $5\nCustomer relationships 910\nGoodwill(a) 5,793\nTotal consideration $6,708\n(a) The goodwill is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes, except for the portion of contingent\nconsideration which is deductible only when paid.\nF-24\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (CONTINUED)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company remeasured the value of its contingent consideration. The primary\ndriver for remeasuring the contingent consideration was the performance by TKE. This remeasurement led to a\n$1.7 million reduction to the contingent consideration liability relating to the TKE acquisition. TKE had high\nyearly performance targets to achieve earn-out consideration. Two factors primarily contributed to TKE not\nhitting its performance targets. The first was the COVID-19 pandemic which overlapped earn-out years two\nand three. TKE had numerous projects in its pipeline that were delayed or eliminated by prospective clients.\nThe second factor relates to a specific client in earn-out year three. This client was dissatisfied with the product\noutput, and TKE agreed to fix the equipment. The additional cost caused TKE to miss its earn-out target. Based\non these factors, the Company determined to amend its asset purchase agreement with TKE, whereby TKE\ncould receive maximum contingent consideration of $0.4 million in 2022 and $0.3 million in 2023. TKE earned\n$0.3 million in 2022, so the Company recorded a remeasurement of contingent consideration for $0.1 million in\n2022.\nPotential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after December 31, 2022 are capped\nat a cumulative maximum of $11.8 million. The Company paid contingent consideration of $0.1 million, $0.5\nmillion and $0.3 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021,\nrespectively.\nThe changes in the liability for contingent consideration from acquisitions for the fiscal years ended December\n31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 are as follows:\nBalance as of December 28, 2019 $3,058\nContingent payments made (345 )\nChanges in fair value of contingent payments 145\nBalance as of January 2, 2021 $2,858\nContingent payments made (494 )\nChanges in fair value of contingent consideration 52\nRemeasurement of contingent consideration (1,713 )\nBalance as of January 1, 2022 $703\nContingent payments made (99 )\nRemeasurement of contingent consideration (88 )\nAcquisition of TalentHerder 1,926\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $2,442\nF-25\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (CONTINUED)\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent\nconsideration may be earned by the sellers: 1) effective September 30, 2018, the Company acquired certain\nassets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, “TKE”), and 2)\neffective October 2, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of TalentHerder LLC. The Company estimates\nfuture contingent payments at December 31, 2022 as follows:\nFiscal Years Ending Total\nDecember 30, 2023 $472\nThereafter 1,970\nEstimated future contingent consideration payments $2,442\nFor acquisitions that involve contingent consideration, the Company records a liability equal to the fair value of\nthe estimated contingent consideration obligation as of the acquisition date. The Company determines the\nacquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on the likelihood of paying the additional\nconsideration. The fair value is estimated using projected future operating results and the corresponding future\nearn-out payments that can be earned upon the achievement of specified operating objectives and financial\nresults by acquired companies using Level 3 inputs and the amounts are then discounted to present value. These\nliabilities are measured quarterly at fair value, and any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration\nliability is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. During the measurement period, which may\nbe up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\nperiod or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially\ndiffer from estimates. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted\nperformance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of December 31, 2022. Contingent\nconsideration related to acquisitions is recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in\nother (expense) income, net.\nDivestiture of Assets\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company sold the principal assets and certain liabilities of its Pickering and Kincardine\noffices, located in Ontario, Canada. These two offices were often referred to as Canada Power Systems and\nprincipally provided engineering services to two major nuclear power providers in Canada. The two Canada\nPower Systems offices were part of a reporting unit within the Company’s Engineering segment. The Company\nwill continue to offer other engineering services in Canada and similar services in the United States. The\nCompany evaluated this transaction under ASC 205-20, discontinued operations and determined it did not meet\nthe requirements to be treated as such. For the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, these\ntwo offices generated revenue of $4.9 million and $11.8 million. The purchase agreement provided for a typical\nindemnity escrow held by an independent escrow agent, the proceeds of which will equal up to $0.7 million, net\nof contingent sale bonuses for former management. The Company received a portion of the escrow during the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The remaining escrow balance has not been recognized in the\nCompany’s financial statements, as the Company does not control the escrow. Provided there are no asserted\nindemnity claims, the Company expects to receive up to $0.4 million net of bonuses during the first half of\nfiscal 2023.\nF-26\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

GOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in\nbusiness combinations. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the\nCompany's fiscal year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value\nof goodwill may be below the carrying amount. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company\nreviewed the carrying value of goodwill due to the events and circumstances surrounding the COVID-19\npandemic and endemic. While COVID-19 has at times negatively impacted the Company and may continue to\nnegatively impact the Company in the future, the Company did not conclude in such review that this negative\nimpact is permanent. The Company reviewed industry and market conditions, reporting unit specific events as\nwell as overall financial performance and determined that no indicators of impairment of goodwill existed\nduring the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021. As such, no\nimpairment loss on the Company’s goodwill during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022\nor January 2, 2021 was recorded as a result of such review.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and\nJanuary 2, 2021 are as follows:\nSpecialty Information\nEngineering Health Care Technology Total\nBalance as of December 28, 2019 $11,918 $2,398 $2,038 $16,354\nNo change in fiscal 2020 - - - -\nBalance as of January 2, 2021 $11,918 $2,398 $2,038 $16,354\nNo change in fiscal 2021 - - - -\nBalance as of January 1, 2022 $11,918 $2,398 $2,038 $16,354\nAcquisition of TalentHerder - - 5,793 6,506\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $11,918 $2,398 $7,831 $22,147\nF-27\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When\nthe Company determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover\nan asset’s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any,\nare reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company’s intangible assets\nconsist of customer relationships and non-compete agreements. During the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2022, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its intangible assets due to the events and circumstances\nsurrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and endemic. While COVID-19 has at times negatively impacted the\nCompany and may continue to negatively impact the Company in the future, the Company did not conclude in\nsuch review that this negative impact is permanent. As such, no impairment loss on the Company’s intangible\nassets during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 was recorded as a\nresult of such review.\nAll of the Company’s intangible assets are associated with the Engineering segment. Intangible assets other\nthan goodwill are amortized over their useful lives. Intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated\namortization.\nDetails of intangible assets by class at December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021:\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nRestricted covenants $ - $ - $12\nCustomer relationships 864 - 83\nTotal intangible assets $864 $ - $95\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and\nJanuary 2, 2021 was $46, $95 and $321, respectively. The remaining intangible asset balance will be amortized\nthrough fiscal 2027.\nEstimated future amortization expense, by fiscal years, for these intangibles assets are as follows:\n2023 $182\n2024 182\n2025 182\n2026 182\n2027 136\nTotal $864\nF-28\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

LINE OF CREDIT\nThe Company’s Revolving Credit Facility provides for a $45.0 million revolving credit facility, has no sub-limit\nfor letters of credit, and expires on August 8, 2023.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the\nCompany at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n(which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) upon the phasing out of LIBOR), plus applicable\nmargin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments, plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-\nday increments or (ii) the agent bank’s prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company\nalso pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line\nfees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees,\nfor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were 2.2%, 2.0% and 2.7%,\nrespectively. However, during the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, it experienced a weighted average\ninterest rate of 5.2%, including unused line. The Company believes its fourth quarter interest rate is more\nreflective of rates expected in the near term.\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains various\nfinancial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts the Company’s ability to borrow in order\nto pay dividends. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in\nthe Revolving Credit Facility (as amended). The Company believes that it will maintain compliance with its\nfinancial covenants for the foreseeable future.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were $8.8\nmillion, $14.2 million and $11.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2,\n2021, there were letters of credit outstanding for $1.9 million. At December 31, 2022, the Company had\navailability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $34.3 million.\nF-29\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

PER SHARE DATA\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares outstanding used for\ndiluted earnings per share. The number of weighted-average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings\nper share for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 was determined as\nfollows:\nFiscal Years Ended\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 10,051,688 11,035,361 12,152,042\nDilutive effect of outstanding restricted share awards 390,488 589,740 -\nWeighted average dilutive shares outstanding 10,442,176 11,625,101 12,152,042\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, there were no anti-dilutive\nshares included in the calculation of common stock equivalents as there were no stock options outstanding.\nUnissued shares of common stock were reserved for the following purposes:\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nTime-based restricted stock awards outstanding 274,939 420,628 459,805\nUnvested subscription restricted share awards - - 250,000\nPerformance-based restricted stock awards outstanding 225,000 125,000 -\nFuture grants of options or shares 890,682 107,924 520,929\nShares reserved for employee stock purchase plan 364,231 448,110 149,894\nTotal 1,754,852 1,101,662 1,380,628\nF-30\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SHARE BASED COMPENSATION\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had two share-based employee compensation plans, the Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan and the 2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.\nThe Company measures the fair value of share-based awards, if and when granted, based on the Black-Scholes\nmethod and using the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Awards\ntypically vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within 10 years of issuance. The Company\nmay also issue immediately vested equity awards. Share-based compensation expense related to time-based\nawards is amortized in accordance with applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. The\nCompany expenses performance-based awards only when the performance metrics are likely to be achieved and\nthe associated awards are therefore likely to vest. Performance-based share awards that are likely to vest are\nalso expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period but may vest on a retroactive basis or be reversed,\ndepending on when it is determined that they are likely to vest, or in the case of a reversal when they are later\ndetermined to be unlikely to vest or forfeited.\nShare-based compensation expense of $1.6 million, $1.4 million, and $1.1 million was recognized for the fiscal\nyears ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively. Share-based compensation\nfor performance-based equity agreements were $0.8 million and $0.4 million for the fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022. There was no performance-based equity expense for the fiscal year\nended January 2, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were 225,000 performance-based restricted stock units\noutstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, with\napproximately $0.5 million related to time-based non-vested share-based awards outstanding and $1.1 million\nrelated to performance-based non-vested share-based awards outstanding. The Company expects to recognize\nthe expense associated with time-based non-vested share-based awards through fiscal 2027. If earned, the\nCompany will recognize the expense associated with performance-based non-vested share-based awards\nstraight-line through fiscal 2023. These amounts do not include a) the cost of any additional share-based\nawards granted after December 31, 2022 or b) the impact of any potential changes in the Company’s forfeiture\nrate.\nIncentive Share-Based Plans\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company implemented the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) with shareholder\napproval, effective January 1, 2001. Under the Purchase Plan, employees meeting certain specific employment\nqualifications are eligible to participate and can purchase shares of common stock semi-annually through\npayroll deductions at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the commencement or end of the\noffering period. The purchase plan permits eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock through\npayroll deductions for up to 10% of qualified compensation, subject to maximum purchases in any one fiscal\nyear of 3,000 shares.\nF-31\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SHARE BASED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (Continued)\nIn fiscal 2015, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,100,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Purchase Plan to December 31, 2025. In fiscal 2018,\nthe Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate number of shares\nof stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 300,000 shares so that the\ntotal number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be 1,400,000 shares. In\nfiscal 2021, the Company amended the Purchase Plan with shareholder approval to increase the aggregate\nnumber of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Purchase Plan by an additional 400,000\nshares so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance or transfer under the Plan shall be\n1,800,000 shares and the termination date of the Purchase Plan was extended to December 31, 2030.\nThe Company has two offering periods in the Purchase Plan coinciding with the Company’s first two fiscal\nquarters and the last two fiscal quarters. Actual shares are issued on the first business day of the subsequent\noffering period for the prior offering period payroll deductions. During the fiscal years ended December 31,\n2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, there were 83,879, 101,784 and 117,983 shares issued under the\nPurchase Plan for net proceeds of $0.4 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. As of December 31,\n2022, there were 364,231 shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Compensation expense,\nrepresenting the discount to the quoted market price, for the Purchase Plan for the fiscal years ended December\n31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 was $0.3 million, $0.1 million and $44, respectively.\n2014 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan)\nThe 2014 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in December 2014, initially provided for the issuance\nof up to 625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to officers, non-employee directors, employees of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries, or consultants and advisors utilized by the Company. In fiscal 2016, fiscal 2020\nand fiscal 2022, the Company amended, or amended and restated, the 2014 Plan with shareholder approval to\nincrease the aggregate number of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the Plan by an additional 500,000,\n850,000 and 1,000,000 shares, respectively, so that the total number of shares of stock reserved for issuance\nunder the Plan is 2,975,000 shares. The expiration date of the Plan is December 17, 2030, unless the 2014 Plan\nis terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with the approval of the stockholders. The\nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the vesting period at the time of grant.\nAll stock awards typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the\nCompany during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period assuming the grantee’s\nstock award fully vests. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31,\n2022, there were no accrued dividends. Dividends for stock awards that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nF-32\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\n2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting\ncredit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities.

ASU 2016-13 and its\namendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022. The Company believes the adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial\ninstruments, but it does not anticipate a material impact on results of operations. The Company is in the process\nof determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This standard only applies to contracts and other\ntransactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be\ndiscontinued due to reference rate reform. This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and\nexceptions to accounting guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease entities’ financial\nreporting burdens as the market transitions from the LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative\nreference rates. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the sunset date of Topic\n848. This update defers the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may\nelect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2024.

INCOME TAXES\nGenerally, the Company’s relative income or loss generated in each of its jurisdictions can materially impact the\nconsolidated effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax\nincome, versus United States pretax income. The consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were 26.7%, 21.0% and 26.4%, respectively. The\nCompany’s United States Federal statutory tax rate for fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022\nand January 2, 2021, before any adjustments, was 21.0%. The income tax provisions reconciled to the tax\ncomputed at the United States Federal statutory rate for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nFederal statutory rate 21.0% 21.0 % 21.0 %\nTax expense on taxable (loss)\nincome at federal statutory rate $5,981 $2,922 ($2,532 )\nState and Puerto Rico income taxes,\nnet of Federal income tax benefit 1,373 519 (535 )\nPermanent differences domestic (52) (114 ) 154\nPermanent differences foreign - (657 ) -\nExcess tax deduction over GAAP deduction\nfor equity awards vested in current year 161 - -\nRemeasurement of contingent consideration - (359 ) -\nIntangible asset deferred tax liability true-up - 491 -\nForeign income tax rates 15 89 (21 )\nAdjustments to prior year federal taxes - 46 (53 )\nOther 113 (12 ) (201 )\nTotal income tax expense (benefit) $7,591 $2,925 ($3,188 )\nF-40\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company’s tax positions is subject to change\nbased on future events including, but not limited to, the settlements of ongoing audits and/or the expiration of\napplicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, it is\nreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits will not change during the next\n12 months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes and timing of those events could cause the\nCompany’s current estimate to change materially in the future.\nThe Company accounts for penalties or interest related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for\nincome taxes and records such amounts to interest expense. The Company recorded no expense for penalties or\ninterest in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021.\nAt December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the\nfollowing:\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nDeferred tax assets:\nAllowance for doubtful accounts $270 $297 $455\nFederal and state net operating loss carryforward - 1,153 2,634\nReserves and accruals 851 800 881\nLease liability 1,118 844 1,174\nOther 220 314 318\nTotal deferred tax assets 2,459 3,408 5,462\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nAcquisition amortization, net (1,696) (1,428 ) (716)\nPrepaid expense deferral (872) (552 ) (602)\nBonus depreciation to be reversed (433) (392 ) (280)\nRight of use assets (953) (501 ) (564)\nCanada deferred tax liability, net (166) (142 ) (365)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (4,120) (3,015 ) (2,527)\nTotal deferred tax (liabilities) assets, net (1,661) $393 $2,935\nThe Company no longer has any operating losses to carry forward.\nThe Company conducts its operations in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and\nSerbia. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated United States Federal income tax return and file in\nvarious states. The Company has no open federal audits as of December 31, 2022. The Company is no longer\nsubject to audits by state and local tax authorities for tax years prior to 2019. The Company is no longer subject\nto audit in Canada for the tax years prior to tax year 2019. The Company is no longer subject to audit in Puerto\nRico for the tax years prior to tax year 2012. The Company has no open state audits as of December 31, 2022.\nDifferences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate may arise, primarily\nfrom the effect of state and local income taxes, share-based compensation, and potential tax credits available to\nthe Company. The actual 2022 effective tax rate may vary from the estimate depending on the actual operating\nincome earned in various jurisdictions, the potential availability of tax credits, and the exercise of stock options\nand vesting of share-based awards.\nF-42\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)\nUnder APB 23, foreign earnings are generally not subject to US tax until repatriated or deemed repatriated\nunder the anti-deferral rules. The Company has determined that as of December 31, 2022, all current and future\nearnings in its foreign subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested. Based on this determination, the anti-\ndeferral rules have no material impact on the Company.\n16. CONTINGENCIES\nFrom time to time, the Company is a defendant in various legal actions that arise in the ordinary business\ncourse. These matters may relate to professional liability, tax, compensation, contract, competitor disputes, and\nemployee-related matters and include individual and class action lawsuits, as well as inquiries and\ninvestigations by governmental agencies regarding the Company’s employment and compensation practices.\nAdditionally, some of the Company’s clients may also become subject to claims, governmental inquiries and\ninvestigations, and legal actions relating to the Company’s professional services. Depending upon the particular\nfacts and circumstances, the Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations under its contracts\nwith such clients relating to these matters.\nAs such, the Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as\npotential ranges of losses and possible recoveries. The Company may not be covered by insurance as it pertains\nto some or all of these matters. A determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments\nand contingencies, if any, which would be charged to earnings, is made after careful analysis of each matter.\nThe Company records a liability when management believes an adverse outcome from a loss contingency is\nboth probable and the amount, or a range, can be reasonably estimated. From time to time, the Company must\nestimate the potential loss even though the party adverse to the Company has not asserted any specific amounts.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount. The\nCompany reviews its loss contingencies at least quarterly and it adjusts its accruals and/or disclosures to reflect\nthe impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, or other new information, as deemed\nnecessary. Once established, a provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in\ncircumstances. The Company could increase or decrease its earnings in the period that the changes are made.\nThe Company is exposed to various asserted claims as of December 31, 2022, where the Company believes it\nhas a probability of loss. Additionally, the Company is exposed to other asserted claims whereby an amount of\nloss has not been declared, and the Company cannot determine the potential loss. Any of these various claims\ncould result in an unfavorable outcome or settlement that exceeds the accrued amounts. However, the Company\nbelieves that such matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany has accrued $2.9 million for asserted claims.\nIn April 2022, a client of the Company’s Industrial Processing Group alleged that a system partially designed by\nthe Company is not operating as intended and that the Company is responsible. The Company has not\ndetermined if it has any liability. In the event of liability, the Company believes its damages are contractually\nlimited to an amount no higher than $3.3 million. Furthermore, the Company believes that if it were found\nliable, any damages would be covered by insurance, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million and maximum\ncoverage of $5.0 million. While the Company attempts to find a mutually agreeable solution, the Company has\nreserved $0.5 million for this project. The Company can give no assurance that its liability is limited to $3.3\nmillion or that liability over $0.5 million, if any, will be covered by insurance.\nF-43\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

RETIREMENT PLANS\nProfit Sharing Plans\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) profit sharing plan for the benefit of eligible employees in the United States\nand other similar plans in Canada, Puerto Rico and Serbia (the “Retirement Plans”). The 401(k) plan includes a\ncash or deferred arrangement pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code sponsored by the\nCompany to provide eligible employees an opportunity to defer compensation and have such deferred amounts\ncontributed to the 401(k) plan on a pre-tax basis, subject to certain limitations. The Company, at the discretion\nof the Board of Directors, may make contributions of cash to match deferrals of compensation by participants in\nthe Retirement Plans. Contributions to the Retirement Plans charged to operations by the Company for the\nfiscal years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were $626, $721 and $217,\nrespectively.\n18. COMMITMENTS\nExecutive Severance Agreements\nThe Company is a party to an Executive Severance Agreement (the “Executive Severance Agreement”) with\neach of Bradley S. Vizi, the Company's Executive Chairman and President (dated as of June 1, 2018), and\nKevin D. Miller, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (dated as of February 28, 2014, as amended), which set\nforth the terms and conditions of certain payments to be made by the Company to the executive in the event,\nwhile employed by the Company, such executive experiences (a) a termination of employment unrelated to a\n“Change in Control” (as defined therein) or (b) there occurs a Change in Control and either (i) the executive’s\nemployment is terminated for a reason related to the Change in Control or (ii) in the case of Mr. Miller, the\nexecutive remains continuously employed with the Company for a period of three months following the Change\nin Control. Each Executive Severance Agreement also provide for certain payments, if either (a) the executive\nis involuntarily terminated by the Company for any reason other than “Cause” (as defined therein), “Disability”\n(as defined therein) or death, or (b) the executive resigns for “Good Reason” (as defined therein), and, in each\ncase, the termination is not a “Termination Related to a Change in Control” (as defined therein).\nLeases\nLeases are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 842, Leases which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-\nuse (“ROU”) asset and an operating right of use liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months and\nrequires disclosures by lessees and lessors about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from\nleases.\nAt January 1, 2021, in connection with the continuing developments from COVID-19, the Company reduced its\nleased office space as a result of its employees moving to a remote work environment. The Company does not\nbelieve there is an opportunity to sublet any of the vacant office space due to the current commercial rental\nmarketplace. This decision and reduction in the use of the office spaces resulted in a right-of-use asset\nimpairment of $1.9 million during the Company’s fiscal year 2020. This loss was determined by identifying the\nfair value of the impacted right-of-use assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets as of the\nmeasurement date, in accordance with Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the FASB ASC. The fair value\nof the right-of-use assets was based on the remaining term of each lease. In addition, the Company wrote off a\ntotal of $0.3 million in other office lease costs and obsolete equipment during fiscal year 2020.\nF-44\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFiscal Years Ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n18. COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)\nLeases (Continued)\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases where the Company is the lessee,\nright of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets and lease\nliabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the\nlease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining\nthe present value of lease payments. The right of use asset also consists of any lease incentives received. The\nlease terms used to calculate the right of use asset and related lease liability include options to extend or\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for\noperating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense while the\nexpense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation expense and interest expense using the accelerated\ninterest method of recognition. The Company has lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-\nlease components. The Company has elected to account for these as a single lease component with the\nexception of its real estate leases.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost $1,598 $1,891 $2,524\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right of use assets $487 $401 $366\nInterest on lease liabilities 7 9 10\nTotal finance lease cost $494 $410 $376\nSupplemental Cash Flow information related to leases was as follows:\nDecember 31, January 1, January 2,\n2022 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement\nof lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $1,633 $1,957 $2,589\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $8 $9 $7\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases $508 $415 $402\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations\nOperating leases $2,790 $830 $1,257\nFinance leases $257 $1,002 $258\nF-45\nRCM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

          "content": "Compensation Committee Charter\nPurpose\nThe Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) has been established by the Board of Directors\n(the “Board”) of RCM Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”). The Committee’s purpose is to\ndischarge the Board’s responsibilities relating to the compensation of the Company’s executive\nofficers and oversight of plans for executive officer development and succession, to fulfill the\nresponsibilities set forth in this Compensation Committee Charter (this “Charter”), and to advise\nthe Board on the adoption of policies that govern the Company’s compensation and benefit\nprograms.

To help achieve this goal, the Committee will endeavor to award\nreasonable and appropriate compensation to each individual consistent with levels of\ncompensation of comparable companies, general economic conditions and the Company’s and\nindividual’s performance. In developing and reviewing compensation policies and practices, and\nin applying those policies and practices to individual compensation decisions, the Committee\nshall at all times consider the impact of its recommendations and actions on its overriding goal of\nenhancing long-term stockholder value.\nMembership; Independence\nThe membership of the Committee shall consist of two or more directors, each of whom shall (a)\nmeet the independence requirements established by the Board and applicable laws, regulations\nand listing requirements, including without limitation requirements set forth in the Marketplace\nRules of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and any independence criteria that may be set forth in\nany corporate governance guidelines established by the Company (b) be a “non-employee\ndirector” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”) and (c) qualify as an “outside director” within the meaning of\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\nNo member of the Committee may accept from the Company or any subsidiary thereof, directly\nor indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee.

In determining whether a\ndirector is eligible to serve on the Committee, the Board of Directors also must consider whether\nthe director is affiliated with the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an affiliate of a\nsubsidiary of the Company to determine whether such affiliation would impair the director’s\njudgment as a member of the Committee.\nPage 1 of 5\nThe Board shall appoint members of the Committee, including the chairperson of the Committee,\nannually. The Board may remove any member from the Committee at any time with or without\ncause.
