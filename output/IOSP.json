          "content": "Innovating with Our Customers\nNOVEMBER 2024\nGeneral Disclosure\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe information presented in this press release includes financial measures that are not calculated or presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP). These non-\nGAAP financial measures comprise adjusted EBITDA, income before income taxes excluding special items, net income excluding special items and related per share amounts together with net cash. Adjusted EBITDA\nis net income per our consolidated financial statements adjusted for the exclusion of interest (income)/expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, recovery of historical pension costs, foreign currency\nexchange losses/(gains), legacy costs of closed operations, adjustment to fair value of contingent consideration and acquisitionrelated costs. Income before income taxes, net income and diluted EPS, excluding\nspecial items, per our consolidated financial statements are adjusted for the exclusion of recovery of historical pension costs,foreign currency exchange losses/(gains), amortization of acquired intangible assets,\nsettlement of historical tax audits, adjustment of income tax provisions, legacy costs of closed operations, adjustment to fair value of contingent consideration and acquisition related costs. Net cash is cash and cash\nequivalents less total debt. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided herein and in the schedulesbelow. The Company believes\nthat such non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and may assist them in evaluating the Company’s underlying performance and identifying operating trends. In addition, these non-GAAP\nmeasures address questions the Company routinely receives from analysts and investors and the Company has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. While the Company\nbelieves that such measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s performance, investors should not consider them to be a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these\nnon-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not provide a comparable view of the Company’s performance relative to other companies\nin similar industries. Management uses adjusted EPS (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for which is GAAP EPS)and net income excluding special items and adjusted EBITDA (the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measure for which is GAAP net income) to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations and has provided a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and net\nincome excluding special items, and related per share amounts, to GAAP net income herein and in the schedules below.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
