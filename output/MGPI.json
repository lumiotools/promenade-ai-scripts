(Nasdaq: MGPI)** , a leading provider of branded and distilled spirits and food ingredient solutions, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Our third quarter performance was in line with the preliminary results we provided on October 17. In response to the softening American whiskey category trends and elevated industry-wide barrel inventories, in 2025 we plan to further lower our net aging whiskey put away, scale down our whiskey production, and optimize our cost structure to mitigate lower production volumes. While current market dynamics will likely have an even greater impact on our Distilling Solutions segment sales and profitability in 2025, we believe that these actions will strengthen the long-term competitive positioning of our brown goods business. Over the longer term, we remain confident in our Distilling Solutions business as our whiskey inventories remain an important part of the still expanding American whiskey category,” said David Bratcher, CEO and president of MGP Ingredients.\n\nHe added, “We are pleased with our progress towards becoming a premier branded spirits company. Though further inventory tightening is a headwind in the near term, we expect our continued investments behind our brands portfolio to deliver attractive organic growth. In addition, we expect our Ingredient Solutions segment to have a stronger 2025 despite current transitory headwinds.”\n\n**2024 third quarter financial highlights compared to 2023 third quarter:**\n\n  * Consolidated sales decreased 24% to $161.5 million. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, consolidated sales decreased by 14%.\n  * Net income increased 82% to $23.9 million. Adjusted net income decreased 5% to $28.8 million. Net income margin increased 860 basis points to 14.8%. Adjusted net income margin increased by 350 basis points to 17.8%.\n  * Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) increased to $1.07 per share from $0.59 per share. Adjusted basic EPS decreased 5% to $1.29 per share from $1.36 per share.\n  * Consolidated gross profit decreased 10% to $65.8 million. Gross margin increased by 610 basis points to 40.8%. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to 40.8% largely due to higher Branded Spirits margins.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9% to $45.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 460 basis points to 28.3%.\n  * Capital expenditures were $44 million year-to-date.\n  * Net debt leverage ratio stands at approximately 1.3x as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Consolidated Results**\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, consolidated sales decreased by 14% year over year, reflecting lower sales in all three operating segments. Consolidated gross profit decreased 10% to $65.8 million, representing 40.8% of sales. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, third quarter 2024 consolidated gross margin improved approximately 30 basis points from the prior year period primarily reflecting strong margin expansion in the Branded Spirits segment. Third quarter 2024 operating income and diluted EPS increased 64% and $0.49 to $32.6 million and $1.07 per share, respectively. On an adjusted basis, operating income decreased 9% to $39.0 million and diluted EPS decreased by 4% to $1.29.\n\n**Distilling Solutions**\n\nFor the third quarter 2024, Distilling Solutions segment sales decreased 36% to $71.9 million. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, segment sales decreased 18% to $71.9 million mainly due to the 22% decline in brown goods sales, including lower aged and new distillate sales. Segment gross profit, as reported, decreased to $28.6 million, or 39.8% of sales, compared to $33.3 million, or 29.8% of segment sales, in the third quarter 2023.\n\n**Branded Spirits**\n\nBranded Spirits segment third quarter 2024 sales decreased 6% to $62.6 million, driven primarily by the decline in mid and value priced portfolio sales. Premium plus sales grew 1% as we continue to execute focused initiatives across the American whiskey and tequila categories. Branded Spirits gross profit increased by 12% to $32.4 million, or 51.8% of segment sales, compared to $29.0 million, or 43.5% of segment sales, in the prior year period.\n\n**Ingredient Solutions**\n\nIngredient Solutions segment sales decreased 18% to $26.9 million primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar's continued impact on our specialty protein sales as well as decreased sales volume of commodity wheat starches due to increased domestic competition. Gross profit decreased to $4.7 million, or 17.6% of segment sales, compared to $11.1 million, or 33.8% of segment sales, in the third quarter 2023. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery and the associated intercompany credit for the waste starch slurry by-product, gross profit decreased to $4.7 million compared to $9.4 million in the third quarter 2023.\n\n**Additional Highlights**\n\nAdvertising and promotion expenses increased 1% to $9.6 million as compared to the third quarter 2023.\n\nCorporate selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the third quarter 2024 decreased $4.4 million, or 20%, to $17.2 million as compared to the third quarter 2023.\n\nDuring the third quarter 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the Penelope acquisition increased by $2.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe corporate effective tax rate for the third quarter 2024 was 24.0%, compared with 25.0% from the year ago period.\n\n**2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nMGP reaffirmed its recently revised consolidated guidance for fiscal 2024:\n\n  * Sales in the range of $695 million to $705 million, following the closure of the Atchison distillery in December 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $196 million to $200 million, inclusive of the add back of share-based compensation expense.\n  * Adjusted basic EPS in the $5.55 to $5.65 range, with approximately 22.1 million basic weighted average shares outstanding at the year end and effective tax rate of approximately 24%.\n  * Full year capital expenditures of $78 million.\n\n\n\nAs is customary, we will share our 2025 financial outlook with our fourth quarter 2024 earnings release; however, we will provide additional commentary on our 2025 outlook in our conference call discussing our third quarter results.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nMGP Ingredients will host a conference call today, October 31, 2024, at 10 a.m. ET to discuss these results and current business trends.

These forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, Company performance, Company financial results, and Company financial condition and are not guarantees of future performance.\n\nAll forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include without limitation any effects of changes in consumer preferences and purchases and our ability to anticipate or react to those changes; our ability to compete effectively; damage to our reputation or that of any of our key customers or their brands; failure to introduce successful new brands and products or have effective marketing or advertising; changes in public opinion about alcohol or our products; our reliance on our distributors to distribute our branded spirits; our reliance on fewer, more profitable customer relationships; interruptions in our operations or a catastrophic event at our facilities; decisions concerning the quantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate; warehouse expansion issues; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; work disruptions or stoppages; climate change and measures to address climate change; our closure of our Atchison, Kansas distillery; regulation and taxation and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations; tariffs, trade relations, and trade policies; excise taxes, incentives and customs duties; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and defend against alleged intellectual property rights infringement claims; failure to secure and maintain listings in control states; labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products; product recalls or other product liability claims; anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and restrictions; class action or other litigation; higher costs or the unavailability and cost of raw materials, product ingredients, energy resources, or labor; failure of our information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers; acquisitions and potential future acquisitions; interest rate increases; reliance on key personnel; commercial, political, and financial risks; covenants and other provisions in our credit arrangements; pandemics or other health crises; ability to pay any dividends; limited rights of common stockholders and anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents; the impact of issuing shares of our common stock; and the effectiveness or execution of our strategic plan. For further information on these risks and uncertainties and other factors that could affect the Company’s business, see the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2024, as well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information in this press release, except as required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to reporting financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, GAAP. In addition to the comparable GAAP measures, the Company has disclosed measures excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, adjusted operating income, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin, adjusted MGP earnings, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt, net debt leverage ratio, and adjusted basic and diluted EPS, as well as guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with operating income, income before income taxes, net income, net income used in earnings per common share calculation, debt, and basic and diluted EPS computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measure. We believe that the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP measures when evaluating the Company’s operating results compared to prior periods on a consistent basis, assessing financial trends, and for forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. The attached schedules provide a full reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Full year 2024 guidance measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS are provided on a non-GAAP basis without a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because the Company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. Such items include without limitation, acquisition related expenses, restructuring and related expenses, and other items not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations.\n\n**MGP INGREDIENTS,

(Nasdaq: MGPI),** a leading provider of branded and distilled spirits and food ingredient solutions, today announced certain preliminary financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Based on preliminary results, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 third quarter** :\n\n  * Sales are expected to decline 24% from the year-ago quarter to $161.5 million. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, sales are expected to decline 14%.\n  * Distilling Solutions segment sales are expected to decline 36%, including a 22% decline in brown goods sales. Branded Spirits segment sales are expected to decline 6% with premium plus sales up 1%, while Ingredient Solutions segment sales are expected to decline 18%.\n  * Net income is expected to increase 82% to $23.9 million. Adjusted net income is expected to decline 5%. Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is expected to increase to $1.07 per share, while adjusted basic EPS is expected to decline 5% to $1.29. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA is expected to decline 9% to $45.7 million.\n\n\n\n**Updated 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nFor the full year 2024, the company now expects financial results to be below the expectations confirmed during its second quarter conference call held on August 1, 2024. The company expects full year 2024 sales to be in the range of $695 million to $705 million, adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $196 million to $200 million, and adjusted basis EPS to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.65, as shown in the below table.\n\n**Revised****Fiscal 2024 Guidance** |  **Previous****Fiscal 2024 Guidance**  \n---|---  \nSales | $695 to $705 million | $742 to $756 million  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $196 to $200 million | $218 to $222 million  \nAdjusted basic EPS | $5.55 to $5.65 | $6.12 to $6.23  \nEffective tax rate | ~24% | ~24.5% to 25.5%  \nBasic weighted average shares outstanding | ~ 22.1 million | ~ 22.3 million  \nCapital expenditures | ~ $78 million | ~ $85 million  \n  \nDavid Bratcher, CEO and president of MGP Ingredients, said, “We are disappointed with our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. Soft alcohol spirits category trends and elevated industry-wide whiskey inventories are putting greater than expected pressure on our brown goods business with a larger impact on our smaller, craft customer base. We expect these industry headwinds to persist at least through the rest of the year and will share details about our 2025 outlook with our fourth quarter 2024 earnings release.”\n\nHe added, “The American whiskey category has successfully navigated periods of temporary supply-demand imbalance over the years, and we are taking proactive steps to strengthen our brown goods business. Our pivot to becoming a branded spirits company continues to gain strength and I remain confident about our attractive long-term growth outlook.”\n\n**Third Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call** The company announced that it will report results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, on Thursday, October 31, 2024 at 10 a.m. ET. The company expects to release its financial results before the markets open. Management, including David Bratcher, CEO and president, and Brandon Gall, CFO, will hold a conference call to discuss these results.\n\nPlease visit the “News and Events” section of the company’s Investor Relations website at ir.mgpingredients.com/news-events to access the live webcast.

(the “Company” or “MGP”) for the rest of the year, ability of the Company to become a branded spirits company, the Company’s growth outlook, and the Company’s 2024 outlook, including its expectations for sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted basic EPS, shares outstanding, and capital expenditures. Forward looking statements are usually identified by or are associated with words such as “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “forecast,” “hopeful,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “encouraged,” “opportunities,” “potential,” and similar terminology. These forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, Company performance, Company financial results, and Company financial condition and are not guarantees of future performance. \n\nAll forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include without limitation any effects of changes in consumer preferences and purchases and our ability to anticipate or react to those changes; our ability to compete effectively; damage to our reputation or that of any of our key customers or their brands; failure to introduce successful new brands and products or have effective marketing or advertising; changes in public opinion about alcohol or our products; our reliance on our distributors to distribute our branded spirits; our reliance on fewer, more profitable customer relationships; interruptions in our operations or a catastrophic event at our facilities; decisions concerning the quantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate; warehouse expansion issues; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; work disruptions or stoppages; climate change and measures to address climate change; our closure of our Atchison, Kansas distillery; regulation and taxation and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations; tariffs, trade relations, and trade policies; excise taxes, incentives and customs duties; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and defend against alleged intellectual property rights infringement claims; failure to secure and maintain listings in control states; labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products; product recalls or other product liability claims; anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and restrictions; class action or other litigation; higher costs or the unavailability and cost of raw materials, product ingredients, energy resources, or labor; failure of our information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers; acquisitions and potential future acquisitions; interest rate increases; reliance on key personnel; commercial, political, and financial risks; covenants and other provisions in our credit arrangements; pandemics or other health crises; ability to pay any dividends; limited rights of common stockholders and anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents; the impact of issuing shares of our common stock; and the effectiveness or execution of our strategic plan. For further information on these risks and uncertainties and other factors that could affect the Company’s business, see the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2024, as well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information in this press release, except as required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** In addition to reporting financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, GAAP. In addition to the comparable GAAP measures, the Company has disclosed sales excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted basic EPS, as well as guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with sales, net income, and basic EPS computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measure. We believe that the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP measures when evaluating the Company’s operating results compared to prior periods on a consistent basis, assessing financial trends, and for forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. The attached schedules provide a full reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Full year 2024 guidance measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS are provided on a non-GAAP basis without a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because the Company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. Such items include without limitation, acquisition related expenses, restructuring and related expenses, and other items not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations.\n\n**For More Information** Investors:Amit Sharmaamit.sharma@mgpingredients.com\n\nMedia:Greg Manisgreg.manis@mgpingredients.com913-360-5440\n\n**MGP INGREDIENTS, INC.****RECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO ADJUSTED NON-GAAP MEASURES**(UNAUDITED)(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\n**Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Net Income** | **Basic EPS**  \n**Preliminary GAAP Results** | **$** | **23,862** | **$** | **1.07**  \nAdjusted to remove:  \nFair value of contingent consideration (a) | **4,864** | **0.22**  \nBusiness acquisition costs (b) | **11** | **—**  \nUnusual items costs (c) | **26** | **—**  \n**Preliminary Adjusted Non-GAAP results** | **$** | **28,763** | **$** | **1.29**  \n  \n**Quarter Ended September 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Net Income** | **Basic EPS**  \n**Reported GAAP Results** | $ | 13,088 | $ | 0.59  \nAdjusted to remove:  \nImpairment of long-lived assets and other (d) | 13,750 | 0.62  \nFair value of contingent consideration (a) | 3,150 | 0.14  \nBusiness acquisition costs (b) | 235 | 0.01  \n**Adjusted Non-GAAP results** | $ | 30,223 | $ | 1.36  \n  \n(a) | Fair value of contingent consideration relates to the quarterly adjustment of the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of Penelope Bourbon LLC.

Forward looking statements are usually identified by or are associated with words such as “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “forecast,” “hopeful,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “encouraged,” “opportunities,” “potential,” and similar terminology. These forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, Company performance, Company financial results, and Company financial condition and are not guarantees of future performance.\n\nAll forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include without limitation any effects of changes in consumer preferences and purchases and our ability to anticipate or react to those changes; our ability to compete effectively; damage to our reputation or that of any of our key customers or their brands; failure to introduce successful new brands and products or have effective marketing or advertising; changes in public opinion about alcohol or our products; our reliance on our distributors to distribute our branded spirits; our reliance on fewer, more profitable customer relationships; interruptions in our operations or a catastrophic event at our facilities; decisions concerning the quantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate; warehouse expansion issues; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; work disruptions or stoppages; climate change and measures to address climate change; our closure of our Atchison, Kansas distillery; regulation and taxation and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations; tariffs, trade relations, and trade policies; excise taxes, incentives and customs duties; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and defend against alleged intellectual property rights infringement claims; failure to secure and maintain listings in control states; labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products; product recalls or other product liability claims; anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and restrictions; class action or other litigation; higher costs or the unavailability and cost of raw materials, product ingredients, energy resources, or labor; failure of our information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers; acquisitions and potential future acquisitions; interest rate increases; reliance on key personnel; commercial, political, and financial risks; covenants and other provisions in our credit arrangements; pandemics or other health crises; ability to pay any dividends; limited rights of common stockholders and anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents; the impact of issuing shares of our common stock; and the effectiveness or execution of our strategic plan. For further information on these risks and uncertainties and other factors that could affect the Company’s business, see the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31 and June 30, 2024, as well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information in this press release, except as required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** In addition to reporting financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, GAAP. In addition to the comparable GAAP measures, the Company has disclosed measures excluding the impact of the Atchison disclosure, adjusted operating income, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin, adjusted MGP earnings, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt, net debt leverage ratio, and adjusted basic and diluted EPS, as well as guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with operating income, income before income taxes, net income, net income used in earnings per common share calculation, debt, and basic and diluted EPS computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measure. We believe that the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP measures when evaluating the Company’s operating results compared to prior periods on a consistent basis, assessing financial trends, and for forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. The attached schedules provide a full reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Full year 2024 guidance measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS are provided on a non-GAAP basis without a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because the Company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. Such items include without limitation, acquisition related expenses, restructuring and related expenses, and other items not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations.\n\n**For More

          "content": "INVESTOR PRESENTATION\nThird Quarter 2024\nOctober 2024\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP DISCLAIMER\nThis presentation may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including without limitation statements regarding the capital allocation\npriorities of MGP Ingredients, Inc. (the “Company” or “MGP”); and the Company’s 2024 guidance, including its expectations for sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted basic earnings per common share (\"EPS\"), tax rate,\nshares outstanding, and capital expenditures. Forward looking statements are usually identified by or are associated with words such as “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,”\n“forecast,” “hopeful,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “encouraged,” “opportunities,” “potential,” and similar terminology. These forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and estimates\nof future economic circumstances, industry conditions, Company performance, Company financial results, and Company financial condition and are not guarantees of future performance.\nAll forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include\nwithout limitation any effects of changes in consumer preferences and purchases and our ability to anticipate or react to those changes; our ability to compete effectively; damage to our reputation or that of any\nof our key customers or their brands; failure to introduce successful new brands and products or have effective marketing or advertising; changes in public opinion about alcohol or our products; our reliance on\nour distributors to distribute our branded spirits; our reliance on fewer, more profitable customer relationships; interruptions in our operations or a catastrophic event at our facilities; decisions concerning the\nquantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate; warehouse expansion issues; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; work disruptions or stoppages; climate\nchange and measures to address climate change; our closure of our Atchison, Kansas distillery; regulation and taxation and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations; tariffs, trade relations, and\ntrade policies; excise taxes, incentives and customs duties; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and defend against alleged intellectual property rights infringement claims; failure to secure and\nmaintain listings in control states; labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products; product recalls or other product liability claims; anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and\nrestrictions; class action or other litigation; higher costs or the unavailability and cost of raw materials, product ingredients, energy resources, or labor; failure of our information technology systems, networks,\nprocesses, associated sites, or service providers; acquisitions and potential future acquisitions; interest rate increases; reliance on key personnel; commercial, political, and financial risks; covenants and other\nprovisions in our credit arrangements; pandemics or other health crises; ability to pay any dividends; limited rights of common stockholders and antitakeover provisions in our governing documents; the impact\nof issuing shares of our common stock; and the effectiveness or execution of our strategic plan. For further information on these risks and uncertainties and other factors that could affect the Company’s business,\nsee the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2024, as well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any\nforward-looking statements or information in this presentation, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, GAAP. In addition to\nthe comparable GAAP measures, the Company has disclosed measures excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, net\ndebt, net debt leverage ratio, and adjusted basic and diluted EPS, as well as guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in\nconjunction with gross profit, operating income, net income, debt, and basic and diluted EPS computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measure. We believe\nthat the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in\nconjunction with GAAP measures when evaluating the Company’s operating results compared to prior periods on a consistent basis, assessing financial trends and for forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures may not provide information that is directly comparable to other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. The appendix provide a full reconciliation of historical non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Full year 2024 guidance measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS are provided on a non-GAAP basis without a\nreconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because the Company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable\nefforts. Such items include without limitation, acquisition related expenses, restructuring and related expenses, and other items not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations.\n2 NASDAQ:MGPI\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nWEAK QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY BROWN GOODS AND INGREDIENT SOLUTIONS HEADWINDS\n• Consolidated sales decreased 14% to $161.5 million(1)\n• Softening whiskey consumption and elevated industry-wide barrel whiskey inventories had a larger and quicker than\nexpected impact on our aged and new distillate sales\n• Our exposure to aged whiskey continues to moderate as aged whiskey accounted for less than 20% of third quarter\n2024 consolidated gross profit, down from nearly half in the first quarter of 2021\n• Planned optimization of mid and value tiered brands drove lower Branded Spirits sales in the quarter.

(Nasdaq: MGPI)** , a leading provider of branded and distilled spirits and food ingredient solutions, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Our third quarter performance was in line with the preliminary results we provided on October 17. In response to the softening American whiskey category trends and elevated industry-wide barrel inventories, in 2025 we plan to further lower our net aging whiskey put away, scale down our whiskey production, and optimize our cost structure to mitigate lower production volumes. While current market dynamics will likely have an even greater impact on our Distilling Solutions segment sales and profitability in 2025, we believe that these actions will strengthen the long-term competitive positioning of our brown goods business. Over the longer term, we remain confident in our Distilling Solutions business as our whiskey inventories remain an important part of the still expanding American whiskey category,” said David Bratcher, CEO and president of MGP Ingredients.\n\nHe added, “We are pleased with our progress towards becoming a premier branded spirits company. Though further inventory tightening is a headwind in the near term, we expect our continued investments behind our brands portfolio to deliver attractive organic growth. In addition, we expect our Ingredient Solutions segment to have a stronger 2025 despite current transitory headwinds.”\n\n**2024 third quarter financial highlights compared to 2023 third quarter:**\n\n  * Consolidated sales decreased 24% to $161.5 million. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, consolidated sales decreased by 14%.\n  * Net income increased 82% to $23.9 million. Adjusted net income decreased 5% to $28.8 million. Net income margin increased 860 basis points to 14.8%. Adjusted net income margin increased by 350 basis points to 17.8%.\n  * Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) increased to $1.07 per share from $0.59 per share. Adjusted basic EPS decreased 5% to $1.29 per share from $1.36 per share.\n  * Consolidated gross profit decreased 10% to $65.8 million. Gross margin increased by 610 basis points to 40.8%. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to 40.8% largely due to higher Branded Spirits margins.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9% to $45.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 460 basis points to 28.3%.\n  * Capital expenditures were $44 million year-to-date.\n  * Net debt leverage ratio stands at approximately 1.3x as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Consolidated Results**\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, consolidated sales decreased by 14% year over year, reflecting lower sales in all three operating segments. Consolidated gross profit decreased 10% to $65.8 million, representing 40.8% of sales. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, third quarter 2024 consolidated gross margin improved approximately 30 basis points from the prior year period primarily reflecting strong margin expansion in the Branded Spirits segment. Third quarter 2024 operating income and diluted EPS increased 64% and $0.49 to $32.6 million and $1.07 per share, respectively. On an adjusted basis, operating income decreased 9% to $39.0 million and diluted EPS decreased by 4% to $1.29.\n\n**Distilling Solutions**\n\nFor the third quarter 2024, Distilling Solutions segment sales decreased 36% to $71.9 million. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, segment sales decreased 18% to $71.9 million mainly due to the 22% decline in brown goods sales, including lower aged and new distillate sales. Segment gross profit, as reported, decreased to $28.6 million, or 39.8% of sales, compared to $33.3 million, or 29.8% of segment sales, in the third quarter 2023.\n\n**Branded Spirits**\n\nBranded Spirits segment third quarter 2024 sales decreased 6% to $62.6 million, driven primarily by the decline in mid and value priced portfolio sales. Premium plus sales grew 1% as we continue to execute focused initiatives across the American whiskey and tequila categories. Branded Spirits gross profit increased by 12% to $32.4 million, or 51.8% of segment sales, compared to $29.0 million, or 43.5% of segment sales, in the prior year period.\n\n**Ingredient Solutions**\n\nIngredient Solutions segment sales decreased 18% to $26.9 million primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar's continued impact on our specialty protein sales as well as decreased sales volume of commodity wheat starches due to increased domestic competition. Gross profit decreased to $4.7 million, or 17.6% of segment sales, compared to $11.1 million, or 33.8% of segment sales, in the third quarter 2023. Excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery and the associated intercompany credit for the waste starch slurry by-product, gross profit decreased to $4.7 million compared to $9.4 million in the third quarter 2023.\n\n**Additional Highlights**\n\nAdvertising and promotion expenses increased 1% to $9.6 million as compared to the third quarter 2023.\n\nCorporate selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the third quarter 2024 decreased $4.4 million, or 20%, to $17.2 million as compared to the third quarter 2023.\n\nDuring the third quarter 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the Penelope acquisition increased by $2.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe corporate effective tax rate for the third quarter 2024 was 24.0%, compared with 25.0% from the year ago period.\n\n**2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nMGP reaffirmed its recently revised consolidated guidance for fiscal 2024:\n\n  * Sales in the range of $695 million to $705 million, following the closure of the Atchison distillery in December 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $196 million to $200 million, inclusive of the add back of share-based compensation expense.\n  * Adjusted basic EPS in the $5.55 to $5.65 range, with approximately 22.1 million basic weighted average shares outstanding at the year end and effective tax rate of approximately 24%.\n  * Full year capital expenditures of $78 million.\n\n\n\nAs is customary, we will share our 2025 financial outlook with our fourth quarter 2024 earnings release; however, we will provide additional commentary on our 2025 outlook in our conference call discussing our third quarter results.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nMGP Ingredients will host a conference call today, October 31, 2024, at 10 a.m. ET to discuss these results and current business trends.

Forward looking statements are usually identified by or are associated with words such as “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “forecast,” “hopeful,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “encouraged,” “opportunities,” “potential,” and similar terminology. These forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, Company performance, Company financial results, and Company financial condition and are not guarantees of future performance.\n\nAll forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include without limitation any effects of changes in consumer preferences and purchases and our ability to anticipate or react to those changes; our ability to compete effectively; damage to our reputation or that of any of our key customers or their brands; failure to introduce successful new brands and products or have effective marketing or advertising; changes in public opinion about alcohol or our products; our reliance on our distributors to distribute our branded spirits; our reliance on fewer, more profitable customer relationships; interruptions in our operations or a catastrophic event at our facilities; decisions concerning the quantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate; warehouse expansion issues; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; work disruptions or stoppages; climate change and measures to address climate change; our closure of our Atchison, Kansas distillery; regulation and taxation and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations; tariffs, trade relations, and trade policies; excise taxes, incentives and customs duties; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and defend against alleged intellectual property rights infringement claims; failure to secure and maintain listings in control states; labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products; product recalls or other product liability claims; anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and restrictions; class action or other litigation; higher costs or the unavailability and cost of raw materials, product ingredients, energy resources, or labor; failure of our information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers; acquisitions and potential future acquisitions; interest rate increases; reliance on key personnel; commercial, political, and financial risks; covenants and other provisions in our credit arrangements; pandemics or other health crises; ability to pay any dividends; limited rights of common stockholders and anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents; the impact of issuing shares of our common stock; and the effectiveness or execution of our strategic plan. For further information on these risks and uncertainties and other factors that could affect the Company’s business, see the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2024, as well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information in this press release, except as required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to reporting financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, GAAP. In addition to the comparable GAAP measures, the Company has disclosed measures excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, adjusted operating income, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin, adjusted MGP earnings, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt, net debt leverage ratio, and adjusted basic and diluted EPS, as well as guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with operating income, income before income taxes, net income, net income used in earnings per common share calculation, debt, and basic and diluted EPS computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measure. We believe that the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP measures when evaluating the Company’s operating results compared to prior periods on a consistent basis, assessing financial trends, and for forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. The attached schedules provide a full reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Full year 2024 guidance measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS are provided on a non-GAAP basis without a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because the Company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. Such items include without limitation, acquisition related expenses, restructuring and related expenses, and other items not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations.\n\n**MGP INGREDIENTS,

(Nasdaq: MGPI), a leading\nprovider of branded and distilled spirits and food ingredient solutions, today reported results\nfor the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n“Our third quarter performance was in line with the preliminary results we provided on\nOctober 17. In response to the softening American whiskey category trends and elevated\nindustry-wide barrel inventories, in 2025 we plan to further lower our net aging whiskey put\naway, scale down our whiskey production, and optimize our cost structure to mitigate lower\nproduction volumes. While current market dynamics will likely have an even greater impact\non our Distilling Solutions segment sales and profitability in 2025, we believe that these\nactions will strengthen the long-term competitive positioning of our brown goods business.\nOver the longer term, we remain confident in our Distilling Solutions business as our whiskey\ninventories remain an important part of the still expanding American whiskey category,” said\nDavid Bratcher, CEO and president of MGP Ingredients.\nHe added, “We are pleased with our progress towards becoming a premier branded spirits\ncompany. Though further inventory tightening is a headwind in the near term, we expect our\ncontinued investments behind our brands portfolio to deliver attractive organic growth. In\naddition, we expect our Ingredient Solutions segment to have a stronger 2025 despite\ncurrent transitory headwinds.”\n2024 third quarter financial highlights compared to 2023 third quarter:\nConsolidated sales decreased 24% to $161.5 million.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our\nexpectations include without limitation any effects of changes in consumer preferences and\npurchases and our ability to anticipate or react to those changes; our ability to compete\neffectively; damage to our reputation or that of any of our key customers or their brands;\nfailure to introduce successful new brands and products or have effective marketing or\nadvertising; changes in public opinion about alcohol or our products; our reliance on our\ndistributors to distribute our branded spirits; our reliance on fewer, more profitable customer\nrelationships; interruptions in our operations or a catastrophic event at our facilities;\ndecisions concerning the quantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate; warehouse\nexpansion issues; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; work disruptions or\nstoppages; climate change and measures to address climate change; our closure of our\nAtchison, Kansas distillery; regulation and taxation and compliance with existing or future\nlaws and regulations; tariffs, trade relations, and trade policies; excise taxes, incentives and\ncustoms duties; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and defend against\nalleged intellectual property rights infringement claims; failure to secure and maintain listings\nin control states; labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our\nproducts; product recalls or other product liability claims; anti-corruption laws, trade\nsanctions and restrictions; class action or other litigation; higher costs or the unavailability\nand cost of raw materials, product ingredients, energy resources, or labor; failure of our\ninformation technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers;\nacquisitions and potential future acquisitions; interest rate increases; reliance on key\npersonnel; commercial, political, and financial risks; covenants and other provisions in our\ncredit arrangements; pandemics or other health crises; ability to pay any dividends; limited\nrights of common stockholders and anti-takeover provisions in our governing documents; the\nimpact of issuing shares of our common stock; and the effectiveness or execution of our\nstrategic plan. For further information on these risks and uncertainties and other factors that\ncould affect the Company’s business, see the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and its Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2024,\nas well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to\nupdate any forward-looking statements or information in this press release, except as\nrequired by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company\nprovides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or\nalternatives for, GAAP. In addition to the comparable GAAP measures, the Company has\ndisclosed measures excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, adjusted operating\nincome, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted net income\nmargin, adjusted MGP earnings, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt, net\ndebt leverage ratio, and adjusted basic and diluted EPS, as well as guidance for adjusted\nEBITDA and adjusted basic EPS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures\nshould be reviewed in conjunction with operating income, income before income taxes, net\nincome, net income used in earnings per common share calculation, debt, and basic and\ndiluted EPS computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a\nsubstitute for the GAAP measure. We believe that the non-GAAP measures provide useful\ninformation to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of\noperations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with\nGAAP measures when evaluating the Company’s operating results compared to prior\nperiods on a consistent basis, assessing financial trends, and for forecasting purposes. Non-\nGAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to other\ncompanies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. The attached\nschedules provide a full reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most\ndirectly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Full year 2024 guidance measures of\nadjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS are provided on a non-GAAP basis without a\nreconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because the Company is\nunable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty certain items contained in the GAAP\nmeasures without unreasonable efforts. Such items include without limitation, acquisition\nrelated expenses, restructuring and related expenses, and other items not reflective of the\nCompany's ongoing operations.\nMGP INGREDIENTS,

          "content": "INVESTOR PRESENTATION\nThird Quarter 2024\nOctober 2024\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP DISCLAIMER\nThis presentation may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including without limitation statements regarding the capital allocation\npriorities of MGP Ingredients, Inc. (the “Company” or “MGP”); and the Company’s 2024 guidance, including its expectations for sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted basic earnings per common share (\"EPS\"), tax rate,\nshares outstanding, and capital expenditures. Forward looking statements are usually identified by or are associated with words such as “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,”\n“forecast,” “hopeful,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “encouraged,” “opportunities,” “potential,” and similar terminology. These forward-looking statements reflect management’s current beliefs and estimates\nof future economic circumstances, industry conditions, Company performance, Company financial results, and Company financial condition and are not guarantees of future performance.\nAll forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include\nwithout limitation any effects of changes in consumer preferences and purchases and our ability to anticipate or react to those changes; our ability to compete effectively; damage to our reputation or that of any\nof our key customers or their brands; failure to introduce successful new brands and products or have effective marketing or advertising; changes in public opinion about alcohol or our products; our reliance on\nour distributors to distribute our branded spirits; our reliance on fewer, more profitable customer relationships; interruptions in our operations or a catastrophic event at our facilities; decisions concerning the\nquantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate; warehouse expansion issues; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; work disruptions or stoppages; climate\nchange and measures to address climate change; our closure of our Atchison, Kansas distillery; regulation and taxation and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations; tariffs, trade relations, and\ntrade policies; excise taxes, incentives and customs duties; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and defend against alleged intellectual property rights infringement claims; failure to secure and\nmaintain listings in control states; labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products; product recalls or other product liability claims; anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and\nrestrictions; class action or other litigation; higher costs or the unavailability and cost of raw materials, product ingredients, energy resources, or labor; failure of our information technology systems, networks,\nprocesses, associated sites, or service providers; acquisitions and potential future acquisitions; interest rate increases; reliance on key personnel; commercial, political, and financial risks; covenants and other\nprovisions in our credit arrangements; pandemics or other health crises; ability to pay any dividends; limited rights of common stockholders and antitakeover provisions in our governing documents; the impact\nof issuing shares of our common stock; and the effectiveness or execution of our strategic plan. For further information on these risks and uncertainties and other factors that could affect the Company’s business,\nsee the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2024, as well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any\nforward-looking statements or information in this presentation, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, GAAP. In addition to\nthe comparable GAAP measures, the Company has disclosed measures excluding the impact of the Atchison distillery, adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, net\ndebt, net debt leverage ratio, and adjusted basic and diluted EPS, as well as guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in\nconjunction with gross profit, operating income, net income, debt, and basic and diluted EPS computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measure. We believe\nthat the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's performance and overall results of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in\nconjunction with GAAP measures when evaluating the Company’s operating results compared to prior periods on a consistent basis, assessing financial trends and for forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures may not provide information that is directly comparable to other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. The appendix provide a full reconciliation of historical non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Full year 2024 guidance measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted basic EPS are provided on a non-GAAP basis without a\nreconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because the Company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable\nefforts. Such items include without limitation, acquisition related expenses, restructuring and related expenses, and other items not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations.\n2 NASDAQ:MGPI\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nWEAK QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY BROWN GOODS AND INGREDIENT SOLUTIONS HEADWINDS\n• Consolidated sales decreased 14% to $161.5 million(1)\n• Softening whiskey consumption and elevated industry-wide barrel whiskey inventories had a larger and quicker than\nexpected impact on our aged and new distillate sales\n• Our exposure to aged whiskey continues to moderate as aged whiskey accounted for less than 20% of third quarter\n2024 consolidated gross profit, down from nearly half in the first quarter of 2021\n• Planned optimization of mid and value tiered brands drove lower Branded Spirits sales in the quarter.

in thousands, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1. Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation\nThe Company. MGP Ingredients, Inc. (the “Company” or “MGP”) is a Kansas corporation headquartered in Atchison, Kansas and is a leading producer of branded and\ndistilled spirits, as well as food ingredient solutions. Distilled spirits include premium bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys (“brown goods”) and grain neutral spirits (“GNS”),\nincluding vodka and gin (“white goods and other co-products”). The Company’s distilled spirits are either sold directly or indirectly to manufacturers of other branded spirits.\nThe Company has a portfolio of its own high quality branded spirits which are produced through its distilleries and bottling facilities and sold to distributors. The Company’s\nbranded spirits products account for a range of price points from value products through premium plus brands. The Company’s protein and starch food ingredients provide a\nhost of functional, nutritional, and sensory benefits for a wide range of food products to serve the consumer packaged goods industry. The ingredients products are sold directly,\nor through distributors, to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries.\nThe Company reports three operating segments: Distilling Solutions, Branded Spirits, and Ingredient Solutions. Certain amounts in the Company’s 2023 condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentation.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly\nowned and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes\nthereto in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The results of\noperations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring\nadjustments) necessary to fairly present the results for interim periods in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the SEC, certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or\nomitted.\nThe Company holds a 60 percent interest in Dos Primos Tequila, LLC (“Dos Primos”). The Company consolidated Dos Primos’ activity on the financial statements and\npresented the 40 percent non-controlling interest portion on a separate line.\nUse of Estimates. The financial reporting policies of the Company conform to GAAP. The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The application of certain of these policies\nplaces demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. For all of these\npolicies, management cautions that future events may not develop as forecast, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment.\nInventory. Inventory includes finished goods, raw materials in the form of agricultural commodities used in the production process as well as bottles, caps, and labels used in\nthe bottling process, and certain maintenance and repair items. Bourbons, ryes, and other whiskeys, included in inventory, are normally aged in barrels for several years,\nfollowing industry practice; all barreled bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys are classified as a current asset. The Company includes warehousing, insurance, and other carrying\ncharges applicable to barreled whiskey in inventory costs.\n9\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, method. Inventory valuations are impacted by constantly changing prices\npaid for key materials. Inventory consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFinished goods $ 50,712 $ 55,463\nBarreled distillate (bourbons and other whiskeys) 282,877 250,183\nRaw materials 27,867 28,825\nWork in process 1,035 1,691\nMaintenance materials 8,353 8,355\nOther 1,309 2,336\nTotal $ 372,153 $ 346,853\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services, through performance obligations by the Company, is transferred to the customer\nin an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the performance obligations. The term between invoicing and when\npayment is due is not significant and the period between when the entity transfers the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or\nservice is generally one year or less.\nRevenue is recognized for the sale of products at the point in time finished products are delivered to the customer in accordance with shipping terms. This is a faithful depiction\nof the satisfaction of the performance obligation because, at the point control passes to the customer, the customer has legal title and the risk and rewards of ownership have\ntransferred, and the customer has a present obligation to pay.\nThe Distilling Solutions segment routinely enters into bill and hold arrangements, whereby the Company produces and sells aged and unaged distillate to customers, and the\nproduct is barreled at the customer’s request and warehoused at a Company location for an extended period of time in accordance with directions received from the Company’s\ncustomers. Even though the aged and unaged distillate remains in the Company’s possession, a sale is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the\nproduct. Control is transferred to the customer in bill and hold transactions when the customer acceptance specifications have been met, legal title has transferred, the customer\nhas a present obligation to pay for the product, and the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Additionally, all of the following bill and hold criteria\nhave to be met in order for control to be transferred to the customer: the reason for the bill and hold arrangement is substantive, the customer has requested the product be\nwarehoused, the product has been identified as separately belonging to the customer, the product is currently ready for physical transfer to the customer, and the Company does\nnot have the ability to use the product or direct it to another customer.\nWarehouse services revenue is recognized over the time that warehouse services are rendered and as they are rendered. This is a faithful depiction of the satisfaction of the\nperformance obligation because control of the aging products has already passed to the customer and there are no additional performance activities required by the Company,\nexcept as requested by the customer. The performance of the service activities, as requested, is invoiced as satisfied and revenue is concurrently recognized. Contract bottling is\nrecognized over the time contract bottling services are rendered and as they are rendered.\nSales in the Branded Spirits segment reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in incentive programs, including discounts and allowances for certain\nvolume targets. These allowances and discounts are not for distinct goods and are paid only when the depletion volume targets are achieved by the customer. The amounts\nreimbursed to customers are determined based on agreed-upon amounts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nExcise Taxes. The Company is responsible for compliance with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department (the “TTB”) regulations,\nwhich include making timely and accurate excise tax payments. The Company is subject to periodic compliance audits by the TTB. Individual U.S. states also impose excise\ntaxes on alcohol beverages in varying amounts. The Company calculates its U.S. federal and state excise tax expense based upon units shipped and on its understanding of the\napplicable excise tax laws. Excise taxes that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and that are collected by the Company from a\ncustomer, are excluded from revenue and expense.\n10\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation\nallowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that at least some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nEarnings Per Common Share (“EPS”). Basic and diluted EPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines net income\nper share for each class of Common Stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Basic EPS amounts are\ncomputed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is computed using the if-\nconverted method by dividing the net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding, inclusive of the impact of the Convertible Senior\nNotes, except for where the result would be anti-dilutive as of the balance sheet date.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies. Assets and liabilities of Niche Drinks Co., Ltd. (“Niche”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company whose functional currency is the\nBritish pound sterling, are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the condensed consolidated balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using\naverage rates during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation process are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nBusiness Combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed during a business combination are generally recorded at fair market value as of the acquisition date. Goodwill\nis recognized to the extent that the purchase consideration, including contingent consideration, exceeds the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company\nuses its internal estimates and third-party valuation specialists to assist in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement\nperiods, which can be up to one year after the acquisition date, the Company can make adjustments to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the offset\nbeing an adjustment to goodwill.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company records goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in connection with various acquisitions of businesses and\nallocates the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to its respective reporting units. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the\nfourth quarter, or on an interim basis if events and circumstances occur that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the\ncarrying value. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized. Judgment is required in the determination of reporting units,\nthe assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. The Company separately evaluates\nindefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The Company determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based upon the\nobservability of inputs. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the\nability to access. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or\nliability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain\ncases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment\nof the significance of a particular input to the fair value in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\nThe Company’s short-term financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying value of the short-term financial\ninstruments approximates the fair value due to their short-term nature. These financial instruments have no stated maturities or the financial instruments have short-term\nmaturities that approximate market.\nThe fair value of the Company’s debt is estimated based on current market interest rates for debt with similar maturities and credit quality .Excluding the impact of the\nconversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes, the fair value of the Company’s debt was $207,827 and $194,440 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The financial statement carrying value of total debt (net of unamortized loan fees) was $289,968 and $287,249 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. These fair values are considered Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.\n11\nThe fair value calculation of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Penelope Bourbon LLC (“Penelope”) uses unobservable inputs, such as estimated net\nsales over the term of the earn-out period, discount rates, and volatility rates. The contingent consideration is measured using the Monte Carlo simulation approach. The inputs\nused in the calculation of the contingent consideration liability are considered Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy due to the lack of relevant market activity. See Note 3,\nBusiness Combination, for more information.\nFair value disclosure for deferred compensation plan investments is included in Note 9, Employee and Non-Employee Benefit Plans.\nEquity Method Investments. The Company holds 50 percent interests in DGL Destiladores, S.de R.L. de C.V. (“DGL”) and Agricola LG, S.de R.L. de C.V. (“Agricola” and\ntogether with DGL, “LMX”), which are accounted for as equity method investments and are considered affiliates of the Company. The investment in LMX, which is recorded in\ninvestment in joint ventures on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $6,643 and $5,197 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the\nquarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain of $832 and $1,446, respectively, from its equity method investments, which is recorded in\nother income (expense), net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. During the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a\ngain of $388 and a loss of $191, respectively, which is recorded in other income (expense), net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company purchased $7,606 and $10,223, respectively, of finished goods from LMX and bulk beverage alcohol\nfrom the other 50 percent owner of DGL. During the year to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company purchased $22,604 and $30,178, respectively, of finished\ngoods from LMX and bulk beverage alcohol from the other 50 percent owner of DGL.\nRelated Party Transaction. The Company leased bottling and warehousing facilities in St. Louis, Missouri from Kemper-Themis, L.L.C. (“Kemper”), which was owned by\nDonn Lux, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. On October 31, 2023, the Company’s Audit Committee and Board of Directors approved the purchase of the\nKemper bottling and warehousing facilities from Kemper for $9,000. The purchase and sales agreement was entered into by both parties subsequent to Board approval and the\ntransaction closed in February 2024. The transaction was entered into at fair value based on two independent appraisers’ valuations; therefore, the transaction is deemed to have\nbeen conducted at an arm’s length.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standard Updates. The Company did not adopt any new Accounting Standard Updates (“ASUs”) during the quarter ended September 30,\n2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires improved disclosures related to significant\nsegment expenses. This ASU requires companies to disclose significant segment expenses provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), a description of other\nsegment items and all existing annual disclosures must be provided on an interim basis. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and must be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial\nstatements. The Company does not expect to early adopt this guidance and is currently evaluating the impact to the Company’s financial statements.\nASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, requires improved disclosures related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU requires companies\nto reconcile the income tax expense attributable to continuing operations to the statutory federal income tax rate applied to pre-tax income from continuing operations.\nAdditionally, this ASU requires companies to disclose the total amount of income taxes paid during the period. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively to all prior periods\npresented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to the Company’s financial statements.\n12\nNote 2. Revenue\nThe Company generates revenue from the Distilling Solutions segment by the sale of products and by providing warehouse services related to the storage and aging of customer\nproducts. The Company generates revenue from the Branded Spirits segment by the sale of products and by providing contract bottling services. The Company generates\nrevenue from the Ingredient Solutions segment by the sale of products. Revenue related to sales of products is recognized at a point in time whereas revenue generated from\nwarehouse services and contract bottling services is recognized over time. Contracts with customers include a single performance obligation (either the sale of products or the\nprovision of warehouse services and contract bottling services).\nDisaggregation of Sales.

Business Combination\nDescription of the Transaction. On May 8, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire1 00 percent of the equity of Penelope, and subsequently\ncompleted the acquisition on June 1, 2023 (the “Acquisition”). Penelope, prior to the Acquisition, was a family and founder-owned and operated American whiskey company\nwith a diverse portfolio of high-quality whiskeys in the premium plus price tier. As a result of the Acquisition, the Company enhanced its presence in the growing American\nwhiskey category and expanded its portfolio of premium plus price tier brands.\nFollowing the Acquisition, Penelope became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and its financial results are included within the Branded Spirits segment. The\naggregate consideration paid by the Company in connection with the Acquisition was $105,000 in cash paid at closing, with further additional potential earn-out consideration\nof up to a maximum cash payout of $110,800 if certain performance conditions, measured through December 31, 2025, are met. The consideration is subject to customary\npurchase price adjustments related to, among other things, net working capital and acquired cash. The consideration paid at closing included a preliminary estimated purchase\nprice adjustment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company finalized the net working capital adjustments, which decreased the cash consideration from\n$105,000 at closing to $104,638 at December 31, 2023. The cash portion of the consideration and transaction-related expenses were paid using both\n13\ncash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s existing credit agreement. See Note 5, Corporate Borrowings, for further details.\nFor tax purposes, the Acquisition was structured as an asset purchase which created additional tax basis in the assets acquired as a result of valuing the assets at fair market value\nand the purchase price will be accounted for in accordance with U.S. federal tax law. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.\nPurchase Price Allocation. The Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations\n(“ASC 805”), and as such, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration transferred were recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the consideration paid for Penelope to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition\ndate, with the excess recorded to goodwill.\nConsideration:\nCash $ 104,638\nContingent consideration 62,100\nFair value of total consideration transferred $ 166,738\nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nCash $ 926\nReceivables 2,323\nInventory 12,454\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 77\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 253\nIntangible assets (a) 57,700\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 426\nOther assets 44\nTotal assets 74,203\nAccounts payable 2,242\nAccrued expenses and other 205\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 268\nTotal liabilities 2,715\nGoodwill 95,250\nTotal $ 166,738\n(a) Intangible assets acquired included trade names with an estimated fair value of $34,000 and distributor relationships with an estimated fair value of $23,700.\nIn accordance with ASC 805, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration transferred were recorded at their estimated fair values on the Acquisition date. The fair\nvalue measurements of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and represent Level 3 measurements within\nthe fair value hierarchy. Level 3 inputs include discount rates that would be used by a market participant in valuing these assets and liabilities, projections of revenues and cash\nflows, distributor attrition rates, royalty rates, and market comparables, among others. The fair value of work-in-process and finished goods inventory was determined using the\ncomparative sales method and raw materials was determined using the replacement cost method.\nGoodwill of $95,250, all of which is deductible for tax purposes, represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired net of\nliabilities assumed. Additionally, the goodwill is representative of the strength of the Penelope brand within the American whiskey category, and the synergies expected to be\nachieved by the combined company. The intangible assets acquired included indefinite-lived intangible assets, trade names, with an estimated fair value of $34,000, and\ndefinite-lived intangible assets, distributor relationships, with an estimated fair value of $23,700 and a useful life of 20 years. The trade names and distributor relationships\nacquired by the Company have been recorded at estimated fair values using the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method, respectively. Management\nengaged a third party valuation specialist to assist in the valuation analysis of certain acquired assets including trade names and distributor relationships.\nThe operating results of Penelope have been included in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements since the\n14\nJune 1, 2023 acquisition date. The operating results and pro forma results are not disclosed due to the immaterial impact to the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements\nof Income.\nDuring the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred $15 and $101, respectively, of costs related to the Acquisition, which are included in\nselling, general, and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nContingent Consideration. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the Acquisition date was $62,100, which was determined using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation approach. This approach requires significant assumptions, including projected net sales, discount rates, and volatility rates. The inputs used in the calculation of the\ncontingent consideration liability are considered Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy due to the lack of relevant market activity. The contingent consideration liability is\nmeasured on a quarterly basis and recorded at fair value. The changes in fair value of the obligation resulted from changes in the key assumptions between measurement dates,\nsuch as projected net sales, discount rates, and volatility rates. During the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, there were $6,400 and $15,900, respectively, in\nadjustments to the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration obligation, which were included in the change of fair value of contingent consideration on the\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The amount payable is based upon achievement of certain net sales targets between the Acquisition date and December 31,\n2025. The possible payments range from zero to a maximum payout of $110,800.\nNote 4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. The Company acquired definite-lived intangible assets in connection with various acquisitions of businesses. The distributor relationships\nhave a carrying value of $56,275, net of accumulated amortization of $8,825. The distributor relationships have a useful life of 20 years. The amortization expense for the\nquarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 was $814 and $2,441, respectively. The amortization expense for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023 was\n$820 and $1,948, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the expected future amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets is as follows:\nRemainder of 2024 $ 814\n2025 3,255\n2026 3,255\n2027 3,255\n2028 3,255\nThereafter 42,441\nTotal $ 56,275\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. The Company records goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in connection with various acquisitions of businesses\nand allocates the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to its respective reporting units. The carrying amount of goodwill, which relates to the Branded Spirits segment,\nwas $321,544 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying amount of trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relates to the Branded Spirits\nsegment, was $212,990 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n15\nNote 5. Corporate Borrowings\nThe following table presents the Company’s outstanding indebtedness:\nDescription(a) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCredit Agreement - Revolver, 6.00% (variable rate) due 2026 $ 70,000 $ 63,000\nConvertible Senior Notes, 1.88% (fixed rate) due 2041 201,250 201,250\nNote Purchase Agreement\nSeries A Senior Secured Notes, 3.53% (fixed rate) due 2027 9,600 12,000\nSenior Secured Notes, 3.80% (fixed rate) due 2029 15,200 17,600\nTotal indebtedness outstanding 296,050 293,850\nLess unamortized loan fees(b) (6,082) (6,601)\nTotal indebtedness outstanding, net 289,968 287,249\nLess current maturities of long-term debt (6,400) (6,400)\nLong-term debt $ 283,568 $ 280,849\n(a) Interest rates are as of September 30, 2024.\n(b) Loan fees are being amortized over the life of the debt agreements.\nCredit Agreement. On February 14, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with multiple participants led by Wells Fargo Bank, National\nAssociation that matures on May 14, 2026. The Credit Agreement provided for a $300,000 revolving credit facility. On May 14, 2021, the Company amended the Credit\nAgreement to extend the terms and to increase the principal amount available to $400,000 and to permit the Company, subject to obtaining lender approval, to increase the\namount of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional $100,000 provided certain conditions are satisfied and at the discretion of the lender. On August 31, 2022, the\nCredit Agreement was amended to change the interest rate benchmark from LIBOR to SOFR. The Credit Agreement includes certain requirements and covenants with which\nthe Company was in compliance at September 30, 2024. Part of the cash portion of the consideration paid to acquire Penelope and transaction-related expenses were financed\nwith $105,000 borrowings under the Credit Agreement during 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $70,000 outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement,\nleaving $330,000 available.\nConvertible Senior Notes. On November 16, 2021, the Company issued $201,250 in aggregate principal amount of 1.88% convertible senior notes due in 2041 (the “2041\nNotes”). The 2041 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 16, 2021 (the “Indenture”), by and among the Company, as issuer, Luxco, Inc., MGPI\nProcessing, Inc., and MGPI of Indiana, LLC, as subsidiary guarantors, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2041 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the\nCompany and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed interest rate of 1.88% on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2041 Notes mature on November 15,\n2041 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted, per the terms of the Indenture. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of\nthe 2041 Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock, at its election, in respect to the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2041 Notes being\nconverted.\nNote Purchase Agreements. The Company’s Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“Prudential”), an affiliate of\nPrudential Financial, Inc., and certain affiliates of Prudential, provides for the issuance of $20,000 of Series A Senior Secured Notes and the issuance of up to $105,000 of\nadditional Senior Secured Notes (or any higher amount solely to the extent Prudential has provided written notice to the Company of its authorization of such a higher amount).\nEffective August 23, 2023, the Note Purchase Agreement was amended to increase the total amount of Senior Secured Notes that may be issued under the facility of the Note\nPurchase Agreement to $250,000. Additionally, the period for issuing senior secured promissory notes under the Note Purchase Agreement was extended from August 23, 2023\nto August 31, 2026.\nDuring 2017, the Company issued $20,000 of Series A Senior Secured Notes with a maturity date of August 23, 2027. During 2019, the Company issued $20,000 of additional\nSenior Secured Notes with a maturity date of April 30, 2029.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $9,600 of Series A Senior Secured Notes and $15,200 of additional Senior Secured Notes\noutstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement, leaving $225,200 available under the Note Purchase Agreement.\n16\nNote 6. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items arising in that quarter. In each quarter,\nthe estimated annual effective tax rate is updated and a year to date adjustment is made to the provision. The Company’s quarterly effective tax rate can be subject to significant\nchange due to the effect of discrete items arising in a given quarter.\nIncome tax expense for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 was $7,554 and $23,924, respectively, for an effective tax rate of2 4.0 percent and 23.8 percent,\nrespectively. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 differed from the 21 percent U.S. federal statutory rate on pretax income primarily\ndue to state income taxes and income taxes on foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by U.S. state and federal tax credits and the deduction applicable to export activity.\nIncome tax expense for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023 was $4,373 and $24,832, respectively, for an effective tax rate of2 5.0 percent and 24.6 percent,\nrespectively. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023 differed from the 21 percent U.S. federal statutory rate on pretax income primarily\ndue to state income taxes and income taxes on foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by U.S. state and federal tax credits and the deduction applicable to export activity.\nNote 7. Equity and EPS\nThe following table presents computations of basic and diluted EPS:\nQuarter Ended September 30, Year to Date Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperations:\nNet income(a) $ 23,862 $ 13,088 $ 76,463 $ 76,084\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 43 123 162 324\nIncome attributable to participating securities (unvested shares and\nunits)(b) (257) (129) (828) (760)\nNet income used in EPS calculation $ 23,648 $ 13,082 $ 75,797 $ 75,648\nShare information:\nBasic weighted average common shares(c) 22,069,885 22,066,159 22,110,315 22,056,270\nDiluted weighted average common shares(d) 22,069,885 22,381,516 22,110,315 22,207,031\nBasic EPS $ 1.07 $ 0.59 $ 3.43 $ 3.43\nDiluted EPS $ 1.07 $ 0.58 $ 3.43 $ 3.41\n(a) Net income attributable to all stockholders.\n(b) Participating securities included 243,243 and 226,410 unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(c) Under the two-class method, basic weighted average common shares exclude unvested participating securities.\n(d) The impacts of the Convertible Senior Notes were included in the diluted weighted average common shares if the inclusion was dilutive. The Convertible Senior Notes would only have a dilutive\nimpact if the average market price per share during the quarter and year to date period exceeds the conversion price of $96.24 per share.\nShare Repurchase. On February 29, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a $100,000 share repurchase program. Under the share repurchase\nprogram, the Company can repurchase stock from time to time for cash in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, in accordance with\napplicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time by the\nCompany without prior notice. During the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 35,913 and 128,360 shares, respectively, of Common\nStock for approximately $2,500 and $10,000, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately $90,000 remaining under the share repurchase program.\n17\nCommon Stock Share Activity. The following table presents the Company’s share activity:\nShares Outstanding\nCapital Stock Preferred Common Stock\nBalance, December 31, 2023 437 22,016,113\nIssuance of Common Stock — 74,913\nRepurchase of Common Stock (a) — (81,969)\nBalance, March 31, 2024 437 22,009,057\nIssuance of Common Stock — 14,627\nRepurchase of Common Stock(a) — (35,999)\nBalance, June 30, 2024 437 21,987,685\nIssuance of Common Stock — 809\nRepurchase of Common Stock(a) — (35,913)\nBalance, September 30, 2024 437 21,952,581\nShares Outstanding\nCapital Stock Preferred Common Stock\nBalance, December 31, 2022 437 21,994,042\nIssuance of Common Stock — 23,324\nRepurchase of Common Stock (b) — (8,437)\nBalance, March 31, 2023 437 22,008,929\nIssuance of Common Stock — 5,445\nBalance, June 30, 2023 437 22,014,374\nIssuance of Common Stock — 822\nBalance, September 30, 2023 437 22,015,196\n(a) 59,084, 33,363 and 35,913 shares that were repurchased during the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, respectively, pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase\nprogram. The remaining shares repurchased were related to the tax withholding on equity-based compensation.\n(b) The Common Stock repurchases were for tax withholding on equity-based compensation.\nNote 8. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, a party to legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company accrues\nestimated costs for a contingency when management believes that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nNote 9. Employee and Non-Employee Benefit Plans\nShare-Based Compensation Plans. The Company had two equity-based compensation plans, the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Non-Employee Director Equity\nIncentive Plan, both of which expired in April 2024. At the Company’s annual meeting in May 2024, the stockholders of the Company approved a new equity-based\ncompensation plan, the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”), which initially authorized 1,319,320 shares for issuance, subject to the adjustment and add-back provision\nof the 2024 Plan. Similar to the prior plans, the 2024 Plan provides for the awarding of stock options, stock appreciation rights, shares of restricted stock, RSUs, and other\nstock-based awards for executive officers and other employees, as well as non-employee directors and certain consultants and advisors. As of September 30, 2024, 1,329,232\nshares remain available for issuance under the 2024 Plan.\n18\nDeferred Compensation Plan. The Company established an unfunded Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the “EDC Plan”) effective June 30, 2018, with a purpose to\nattract and retain highly-compensated key employees by providing participants with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and other specified\ncompensation. The Company’s obligations under the EDC Plan change in conjunction with the performance of the participants’ investments, along with contributions to and\nwithdrawals from the EDC Plan. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan investments were included as a component of other income (expense),\nnet on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a gain on deferred\ncompensation plan investments of $196 and $482, respectively, and for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a loss on deferred\ncompensation plan investments of $118 and a gain on deferred compensation plan investments of $272, respectively.\nEDC Plan investments are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy since the investments trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable the Company to obtain\npricing information on an ongoing basis. Participants were able to direct the deferral of a portion of their base salary and a portion of their estimated accrued short-term\nincentive plan (“STI Plan”) amounts that were paid during the first quarter of the following year. Base salary amounts elected for deferral are deposited into the EDC Plan by the\nCompany on a weekly basis and allocated by participants among Company-determined investment options. STI Plan deferral amounts are deposited, at the time of payment, into\nthe EDC Plan by the Company and allocated by participants among Company-determined investment options.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the EDC Plan investments were $3,659 and $2,916, respectively, which were recorded in other assets on the Company’s\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The EDC Plan current liabilities were $1,796 and $74 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which were\nincluded in accrued expenses and other on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The EDC Plan non-current liabilities were $2,003 and $3,314 at September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and were included in other noncurrent liabilities on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 10. Operating Segments\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had three segments: Distilling Solutions, Branded Spirits, and Ingredient Solutions. The Company’s reportable segments are based on the\nfinancial information the chief operating decision maker, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, uses to allocate resources and evaluate performance of the business. The\nDistilling Solutions segment consists of food grade alcohol (primarily brown goods) and distillery co-products, such as distillers feed (commonly called dried distillers grain in\nthe industry). The Distilling Solutions segment also includes warehouse services, such as barrel put away, barrel storage, and barrel retrieval services. The Branded Spirits\nsegment consists of a portfolio of high quality branded spirits which are produced through the distilleries and bottling facilities. The Ingredient Solutions segment consists of\nspecialty starches and proteins as well as commodity starches and proteins. Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at cost and are treated as a transfer of inventory. All\nintercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating segment performance.\nOperating profit for each segment is based on sales less identifiable operating expenses. Non-direct selling, general, and administrative expenses, interest expense, and other\ngeneral miscellaneous expenses are excluded from segment operations and are classified as Corporate. Receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment, leases,\ngoodwill, and intangible assets have been identified with the segments to which they relate. All other assets are considered as Corporate.\n19\nThe following table presents summarized financial information for each segment:\nQuarter Ended September 30, Year to Date Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSales to Customers\nDistilling Solutions $ 71,919 $ 111,853 $ 250,159 $ 341,941\nBranded Spirits 62,624 66,819 176,811 181,318\nIngredient Solutions 26,918 32,952 95,859 98,376\nTotal $ 161,461 $ 211,624 $ 522,829 $ 621,635\nGross Profit\nDistilling Solutions $ 28,644 $ 33,280 $ 105,200 $ 104,986\nBranded Spirits 32,446 29,040 88,611 79,636\nIngredient Solutions 4,725 11,128 18,031 34,945\nTotal $ 65,815 $ 73,448 $ 211,842 $ 219,567\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDistilling Solutions $ 1,975 $ 3,082 $ 5,900 $ 8,803\nBranded Spirits 2,192 1,914 5,867 5,063\nIngredient Solutions 1,178 619 3,517 1,899\nCorporate 335 167 1,014 507\nTotal $ 5,680 $ 5,782 $ 16,298 $ 16,272\nIncome (loss) before Income Taxes\nDistilling Solutions $ 27,631 $ 13,930 $ 102,228 $ 84,187\nBranded Spirits 7,391 7,199 15,534 25,577\nIngredient Solutions 3,277 9,408 13,781 30,255\nCorporate (6,883) (13,076) (31,156) (39,103)\nTotal $ 31,416 $ 17,461 $ 100,387 $ 100,916\nThe following table allocates assets to each segment as of:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nIdentifiable Assets\nDistilling Solutions $ 361,553 $ 369,241\nBranded Spirits 921,572 910,633\nIngredient Solutions 120,903 88,846\nCorporate 36,591 23,628\nTotal $ 1,440,619 $ 1,392,348\nNote 11. Subsequent Events\nDividend. On October 31, 2024, the Company announced a quarterly dividend payable to stockholders of record of the Company’s common stock, resulting in dividend\nequivalents payable to RSU holders, of $0.12 per share and per RSU.

Our ingredients products are sold directly,\nor through distributors, to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes included in this Report, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - General,” set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n21\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results\nThe table below details the consolidated results for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nQuarter Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 v. 2023\nSales $ 161,461 $ 211,624 (24)%\nCost of sales 95,646 138,176 (31)\nGross profit 65,815 73,448 (10)\nGross margin % 40.8 % 34.7 % 6.1 pp(a)\nAdvertising and promotion expenses 9,647 9,505 1\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses 17,204 21,570 (20)\nImpairment of long-lived assets and other — 18,334 N/A\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration 6,400 4,200 52\nOperating income 32,564 19,839 64\nOperating margin % 20.2 % 9.4 % 10.8 pp\nInterest expense, net (2,174) (2,353) 8\nOther income (expense), net 1,026 (25) 4,204\nIncome before income taxes 31,416 17,461 80\nIncome tax expense 7,554 4,373 73\nEffective tax expense rate % 24.0 % 25.0 % (1.0) pp\nNet income $ 23,862 $ 13,088 82 %\nNet income margin % 14.8 % 6.2 % 8.6 pp\n(a) Percentage points (“pp”).\nSales - Sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $161,461, a decrease of 24 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, which was the result of decreased sales in each\nsegment. Within the Distilling Solutions segment, sales were down 36 percent due to decreased sales of white goods and other co-products in connection with the December\n2023 closure of our distillery located in Atchison, Kansas (the “Atchison Distillery”), as well as decreased brown goods sales. Within the Ingredient Solutions segment, sales\nwere down 18 percent, due to decreased sales of specialty wheat proteins, commodity wheat starches, and specialty wheat starches. Within the Branded Spirits segment, sales\nwere down 6 percent, primarily due to decreased sales of brands in the mid and value price tiers (see “Segment Results”).\nGross profit - Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $65,815, a decrease of 10 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by a\ndecrease in gross profit in the Ingredient Solutions and Distilling Solutions segments, partially offset by an increase in gross profit in the Branded Spirits segment. Within the\nIngredient Solutions segment, gross profit decreased by $6,403, or 58 percent. Within the Distilling Solutions segment, gross profit declined by $4,636, or 14 percent. Within the\nBranded Spirits segment, gross profit increased $3,406, or 12 percent (see “Segment Results”).\nAdvertising and promotion expenses - Advertising and promotion expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $9,647, a slight increase of 1 percent compared to the\nyear-ago quarter.\nSG&A expenses - SG&A expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $17,204, a decrease of 20 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. The decrease in SG&A\nexpenses was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation expenses.\n22\nOperating income - Operating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased to $32,564 from $19,839 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a\nresult of the 2023 impairment of long-lived assets and other expenses of $18,334 related to the closure of the Atchison Distillery that did not recur during the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. Additionally, the increase in operating income was due to the lower SG&A expenses and the increase in gross profit in the Branded Spirits segment. These\nincreases were partially offset by decreases in gross profit in the Ingredient Solutions and Distilling Solutions segments.\nOperating income, quarter versus quarter Operating Income Change\nOperating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 $ 19,839\nIncrease in gross profit - Branded Spirits segment(a) 3,406 17 %\nDecrease in gross profit - Ingredient Solutions segment(a) (6,403) (32) pp(b)\nDecrease in gross profit - Distilling Solutions segment(a) (4,636) (23) pp\nIncrease in advertising and promotion expenses (142) (1) pp\nDecrease in SG&A expenses 4,366 22 pp\nImpairment of long-lived assets and other 18,334 92 pp\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (2,200) (11) pp\nOperating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 $ 32,564 64 %\n(a) See “Segment Results.”\n(b) Percentage points (“pp”).\nIncome tax expense - Income tax expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $7,554, for an effective tax rate of 24.0 percent. Income tax expense for the quarter\nended September 30, 2023 was $4,373, for an effective tax rate of 25.0 percent. The increase in income tax expense, quarter versus quarter, was due to higher income before\nincome taxes. The decrease in effective tax rate, quarter versus quarter, was primarily due to larger tax credits than in the prior year.\nEarnings per common share (“EPS”) - Basic and Diluted EPS was $1.07 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.59 and $0.58, respectively for the quarter\nended September 30, 2023.

Within the Distilling Solutions segment, sales were down 27 percent primarily due to decreased sales of white goods and other co-products in connection with the\nDecember 2023 closure of the Atchison Distillery. Sales of Branded Spirits were down 2 percent, primarily due to decreased sales of brands within the mid and value price tiers.\nWithin the Ingredient Solutions segment, sales were down 3 percent, primarily due to decreased sales of specialty wheat proteins and commodity wheat starches (see “Segment\nResults”).\nGross profit - Gross profit for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was $211,842, a decrease of 4 percent compared to the year-ago period. The decrease was driven by a\ndecrease in gross profit in the Ingredient Solutions segment, partially offset by an increase in gross profit in the Branded Spirits segment. In the Ingredient Solutions segment,\ngross profit decreased by $16,914, or 48 percent. In the Branded Spirits segment, gross profit increased by $8,975, or 11 percent. In the Distilling Solutions segment, gross profit\nwas consistent with the year-ago period (see “Segment Results”).\nAdvertising and promotion expenses - Advertising and promotion expenses for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 were $29,995, an increase of 16 percent compared to\nthe year-ago period, primarily driven by increased advertising and promotion investment in the Branded Spirits segment, specifically in the premium plus price tier.\nSG&A expenses - SG&A expenses for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 were $60,942, a decrease of 7 percent compared to the year-ago period. The decrease in\nSG&A expenses was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation expenses.\nOperating income - Operating income for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 decreased to $104,868 from $105,541 for the year to date period ended September 30,\n2023, primarily due to the decrease in gross profit in the Ingredient Solutions segment, the change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Penelope\nacquisition, and the increase in advertising and promotion expenses. These decreases were partially offset by the impairment of assets and other expenses in the year ago period\nrelated to the closure of the Atchison Distillery which was closed in December 2023, increased gross profit in the Branded Spirits segment, and a decrease in SG&A expenses.\n24\nOperating income, year to date versus year to date Operating Income Change\nOperating income for the year to date ended September 30, 2023 $ 105,541\nDecrease in gross profit - Ingredient Solutions segment(a) (16,914) (16) %\nIncrease in gross profit - Branded Spirits segment(a) 8,975 9 pp(b)\nIncrease in gross profit - Distilling Solutions segment(a) 214 — pp\nIncrease in advertising and promotion expenses (4,118) (4) pp\nDecrease in SG&A expenses 4,673 4 pp\nImpairment of long-lived assets and other 18,197 17 pp\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (11,700) (11) pp\nOperating income for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 $ 104,868 (1)%\n(a) See “Segment Results.”\n(b) Percentage points (“pp”).\nIncome tax expense - Income tax expense for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was $23,924, for an effective tax rate of 23.8 percent.

The decrease\nin sales of the Distilling Solutions segment is primarily related to the decrease in sales volume of white goods and other co-products, which was due to the closure of the\nAtchison Distillery during December 2023. Sales of brown goods decreased primarily due to a decrease in net price/mix and decreased sales volume (as defined in the table\nabove). The brown goods decline was primarily the result of softening American whiskey category trends and elevated industry-wide barrel inventories, leading to instances of\ncustomer contract non-performance that put pressure on our brown goods business with a larger impact on our smaller, craft customer base. We expect these trends to continue,\nwhich may impact our future results of operations.\nGross profit decreased quarter versus quarter by $4,636, or 14 percent. Gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased to 39.8 percent from 29.8 percent for\nthe prior year quarter. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in brown goods sales due to decreases in net price/mix and sales volumes of brown goods,\npartially offset by lower average unit costs. This was partially offset by the positive impact the closure of the Atchison Distillery had on white goods and other co-products’\ngross profit.\n26\nThe following tables show selected financial information for the Distilling Solutions segment for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nDISTILLING SOLUTIONS SALES\nYear to Date versus Year to Date\nYear to Date Ended September 30, Sales Change Increase/(Decrease)\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nBrown goods $ 198,884 $ 214,857 $ (15,973) (7)%\nWarehouse services 24,612 20,958 3,654 17\nWhite goods and other co-products 26,663 106,126 (79,463) (75)\nTotal Distilling Solutions $ 250,159 $ 341,941 $ (91,782) (27)%\nChange in Year to Date versus Year to Date Sales Attributed to:\nTotal(a) Volume(b) Net Price/Mix(c)\nBrown goods (7)% 6% (13)%\nOther Financial Information\nYear to Date versus Year to Date Increase /\nYear to Date Ended September 30, (Decrease)\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nGross profit $ 105,200 $ 104,986 $ 214 — %\nGross margin % 42.1 % 30.7 % 11.4 pp(d)\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Volume change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales volume and prior period sales volume, multiplied by prior period sales per unit.

The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by increased input costs primarily due to the removal of the intercompany credit for the waste starch\nslurry by-product since the closure of the Atchison Distillery, as well as other costs incurred to ready the waste starch for commercial sale. Additionally, the decrease in gross\nprofit was attributable to decreased sales volume of specialty wheat proteins.\n30\nThe following tables show selected financial information for the Ingredient Solutions segment for the year to date September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nINGREDIENT SOLUTIONS SALES\nYear to Date versus Year to Date Sales Change\nYear to Date Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease)\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSpecialty wheat starches $ 57,646 $ 48,977 $ 8,669 18 %\nSpecialty wheat proteins 28,947 35,918 (6,971) (19)\nCommodity wheat starches 8,846 12,870 (4,024) (31)\nCommodity wheat proteins 420 611 (191) (31)\nTotal Ingredient Solutions $ 95,859 $ 98,376 $ (2,517) (3)%\nChange in Year to Date versus Year to Date Sales Attributed to:\nTotal(a) Volume(b) Net Price/Mix(c)\nTotal Ingredient Solutions (3)% 2% (5)%\nOther Financial Information\nYear to Date versus Year to Date Increase /\nYear to Date Ended September 30, (Decrease)\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nGross profit $ 18,031 $ 34,945 $ (16,914) (48)%\nGross margin % 18.8 % 35.5 % (16.7) pp(d)\n(a) Total sale changes is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Volume change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales volume and prior period sales volume, multiplied by prior period sales per unit.

The\ndecrease was primarily driven by decreased net price/mix across all product categories, as well as a decrease in sales volume of specialty wheat protein primarily due to\ncontinued export market headwinds. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales volume of specialty wheat starches.\nGross profit decreased by $16,914, or 48 percent for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. Gross margin for the year to date ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 decreased to 18.8 percent from 35.5 percent for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by higher input costs associated with\nthe removal of the intercompany credit for the waste starch slurry by-product since the closure of the Atchison Distillery, as well as other costs incurred to ready the waste\nstarch for commercial sale. Additionally, we incurred incremental costs for the new extrusion manufacturing facility during the year to date period. The decrease in gross profit\nwas also attributable to decreased sales volume of specialty wheat proteins.\n31\nCASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND LIQUIDITY\nWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate adequate cash from operations while having ready access to capital at\ncompetitive rates.\nOperating cash flow and borrowings through our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes, and Note Purchase Agreement (see Note 5, Corporate Borrowings) provide the\nprimary sources of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. These same sources of cash are used to fund stockholder dividends and other discretionary uses. Our\noverall liquidity reflects our strong business results and an effective cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors, and tax\nconsiderations. We expect our sources of cash to be adequate to provide for budgeted capital expenditures, potential mergers or acquisitions, and anticipated operating\nrequirements for the next 12 months and beyond.\nCash Flow Summary\nYear to Date Ended September 30,\nChanges, year versus year\n2024 2023 Increase / (Decrease)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 73,512 $ 48,605 $ 24,907\nNet cash used in investing activities (53,126) (146,690) 93,564\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (18,048) 78,193 (96,241)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash 46 33 13\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,384 $ (19,859) $ 22,243\nCash increased $2,384 for the year to date ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of $19,859 for the year to date ended September 30, 2023, for a net increase in\ncash of $22,243, period versus period.\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was $73,512. The cash provided by operating activities resulted\nprimarily from net income of $76,463, adjustments for non-cash or non-operating charges of $32,845, including depreciation and amortization, the change in fair value of\ncontingent consideration, and share-based compensation, partially offset by cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $35,796. The primary drivers of the changes in\noperating assets and liabilities were $24,979 use of cash related to an increase in inventories, primarily due to an increase in barreled distillate, $10,627 use of cash related to a\ndecrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments, $9,935 related to accrued expenses and other, which related to a decrease in our incentive compensation accrual,\npartially offset by $13,979 cash provided by decreased accounts receivables, net, due to the timing of sales and customer payments during the year to date period as well as the\nclosure of the Atchison Distillery in December 2023.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2023 was $48,605. The cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income\nof $76,084, adjustments for non-cash or non-operating charges of $42,912, including impairment of long-lived assets and other, depreciation and amortization, share-based\ncompensation and the change in fair value of contingent consideration, partially offset by cash used in operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of acquisition, of\n$70,391. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were $42,015 use of cash related to an increase in inventories, primarily due to an increase in\nbarreled distillate, $14,980 use of cash related to increased accounts receivable, net, due to timing of sales and customer payments during the quarter, and $10,069 use of cash\nrelated to a decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was $53,126, which primarily resulted from additions to property, plant,\nand equipment of $52,850 (see “Capital Spending”). Cash used in investing activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2023 was $146,690, which primarily resulted\nfrom $103,712 related to the acquisition of Penelope, net of cash acquired, and additions to property, plant, and equipment of $42,062 (see “Capital Spending”).\nCapital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans. We have incurred $43,503 and $36,879 of capital expenditures and have paid $52,850\nand $42,062 for capital expenditures for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference between the amount of capital expenditures incurred\nand amount paid is due to the change in capital expenditures in accounts payable. We expect approximately $78,000 in capital expenditures in 2024, which includes capital\nexpenditures for facility improvement and expansion, facility sustaining projects, and environmental health and safety projects.\n32\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was $18,048, due to repurchases of Common Stock of $12,235 (see\n“Treasury Purchases” and “Share Repurchase”), and payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $8,013 (see “Dividends and Dividend Equivalents”), partially offset by\nnet proceeds on debt of $2,200 (see “Long-Term and Short-Term Debt”).\nCash provided by financing activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2023 was $78,193, due to net proceeds on debt of $87,000 (see “Long-Term and Short-Term\nDebt”), partially offset by payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $8,006 (see “Dividends and Dividend Equivalents”), and repurchase of Common Stock of $801\n(see “Treasury Purchases”).\nTreasury Purchases. 81,942 RSUs vested and converted to shares of Common Stock for employees during the year to date ended September 30, 2024, of which we withheld\nand purchased for treasury 25,521 shares valued at $2,185 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes.\n22,592 RSUs vested and converted to shares of Common Stock for employees during the year to date ended September 30, 2023, of which we withheld and purchased for\ntreasury 8,437 shares valued at $801 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes.\nShare Repurchase. On February 29, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a $100,000 share repurchase program. Under the share repurchase program, we\ncan repurchase Common Stock from time to time for cash in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, in accordance with applicable\nsecurities laws and other legal requirements. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time by the Company\nwithout prior notice. During the year to date ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 128,360 shares of Common Stock for approximately $10,000, resulting in\napproximately $90,000 remaining under the share repurchase program.\nDividends and Dividend Equivalents\nDividend and Dividend Equivalent Information (per Share and Unit)\nDividend\nDividend equivalent Total\nDeclaration date Record date Payment date Declared(c) Paid(c) payment payment(a)(b) payment(b)\n2024\nFebruary 22, 2024 March 15, 2024 March 29, 2024 $ 0.12 $ 0.12 $ 2,641 $ 31 $ 2,672\nMay 2, 2024 May 17, 2024 May 31, 2024 0.12 0.12 2,642 30 2,672\nAugust 1, 2024 August 16, 2024 August 30, 2024 0.12 0.12 2,639 30 2,669\n$ 0.36 $ 0.36 $ 7,922 $ 91 $ 8,013\n2023\nFebruary 23, 2023 March 10, 2023 March 24, 2023 $ 0.12 $ 0.12 $ 2,640 $ 29 $ 2,669\nMay 4, 2023 May 19, 2023 June 2, 2023 0.12 0.12 2,641 27 2,668\nAugust 3, 2023 August 18, 2023 September 1, 2023 0.12 0.12 2,642 27 2,669\n$ 0.36 $ 0.36 $ 7,923 $ 83 $ 8,006\n(a) Dividend equivalent payments on unvested participating securities.\n(b) Includes estimated forfeitures.\n(c) Per share amount.\nOn October 31, 2024, we announced a dividend payable to stockholders of record of our Common Stock, resulting in dividend equivalents payable to RSU holders, of $0.12\nper share and per RSU. The dividend and dividend equivalent are payable on November 29, 2024 to stockholders of record and RSU holders on November 15, 2024.\nLong-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements\nfor ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including brand development, merger and acquisition, and share repurchase activities), and the overall cost of capital.\nTotal debt was $289,968 (net of unamortized loan fees of $6,082) at September 30, 2024, and $287,249 (net of unamortized loan fees of $6,601) at December 31, 2023.\n33\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity. Our principal uses of cash in the ordinary course of business are for input costs used in our production processes, salaries, capital\nexpenditures, and investments supporting our strategic plan, such as the aging of barreled distillate and potential mergers and acquisitions. Generally, during periods when\ncommodities prices are rising, our operations require increased use of cash to support inventory levels.\nOur principal sources of cash are product sales and borrowing on our various debt agreements. Under our debt agreements, we must meet certain financial covenants and\nrestrictions, and at September 30, 2024, we met those covenants and restrictions.\nAt September 30, 2024, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by $449,670, largely due to our inventories, at cost, of $372,153. At September 30, 2024, our cash\nbalance was $20,772 and we have used our various debt agreements for liquidity purposes, with $330,000 available under our Credit Agreement for additional borrowings and\n$225,200 available under the Note Purchase Agreement (see Note 5, Corporate Borrowings). We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs\nlargely through cash generated from operations. We regularly assess our cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. We utilize short-term and long-term debt to\nfund discretionary items, such as capital investments, dividend payments, and potential mergers and acquisitions. Subject to market conditions, we could also fund future\nmergers and acquisitions through the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock. In addition, we have strong operating results such that we believe financial institutions\nshould provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements, if needed.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk\nmanagement program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets with the goal to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on\nour operating results and financial condition.\nCommodity Costs. Certain commodities we use in our production process, or input costs, expose us to market price risk due to volatility in the prices for those commodities.\nThrough our grain supply contracts for our Lawrenceburg facility, our wheat flour supply contract for our Atchison facility, and our natural gas contracts for both facilities, we\npurchase grain, wheat flour, and natural gas, respectively, for delivery from one to 24 months into the future at negotiated prices. We have determined that the firm\ncommitments to purchase grain, wheat flour, and natural gas under the terms of our supply contracts meet the normal purchases and sales exception as defined under\nAccounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging, because the quantities involved are for amounts to be consumed within the normal expected production\nprocess.\nInterest Rate Exposures. Our various debt agreements (see Note 5, Corporate Borrowings) expose us to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates. Established\nprocedures and internal processes govern the management of this market risk.\nIncreases in market interest rates would cause interest expense under our variable interest rate debt to increase and earnings before income taxes to decrease. The change in\ninterest expense and earnings before income taxes would be dependent upon the weighted average outstanding borrowings under variable interest rate debt during the reporting\nperiod following an increase in market interest rates. Based on weighted average outstanding variable-rate borrowings at September 30, 2024, a 100 basis point increase over\nthe current rates actually in effect at such date would increase our interest expense on an annual basis by $700. Based on weighted average outstanding fixed-rate borrowings at\nSeptember 30, 2024, a 100 basis point increase in market rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our outstanding fixed-rate debt of $22,927, and a 100 basis point\ndecrease in market rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our outstanding fixed-rate debt of $9,172.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each reviewed and evaluated\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange\nAct”)). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective\nto ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the\ntime periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n34\nChanges in Internal Control. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II.

BUSINESS\nMGP Ingredients, Inc. was incorporated in 2011 in Kansas, continuing a business originally founded by Cloud L. Cray, Sr. in Atchison, Kansas in 1941. As used herein, the term\n“MGP,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and words of similar import, refers to MGP Ingredients, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise indicates. In\nthis Report, for any references to Note 1 through Note 16 refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe make available through our website (www.mgpingredients.com) under “Investors,” free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,\ncurrent reports on Form 8-K, special reports, and other information, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish\nsuch material with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThe SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC,\nincluding the Company. The address of the SEC site is http://www.sec.gov.\nMETHOD OF PRESENTATION\nAll amounts in this Report, except for shares, par values, bushels, gallons, pounds, mmbtu, proof gallons, 9-liter cases, per share, per bushel, per gallon, per proof gallon, per 9-\nliter case, and percentage amounts, are shown in thousands unless otherwise noted.\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nMGP is a leading producer and supplier of premium distilled spirits, branded spirits, and food ingredients. Distilled spirits include premium bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys\n(“brown goods”) and grain neutral spirits (“GNS”), including vodka and gin. Our distilled spirits are either sold directly or indirectly to manufacturers of other branded spirits.\nMGP was also a producer of high quality industrial alcohol for use in both food and non-food applications, which was primarily produced at our distillery located in Atchison,\nKansas, prior to its closure during December 2023. We also have a portfolio of our own high quality branded spirits, which we produce through our distilleries and bottling\nfacilities and sell to distributors. Our branded spirits products account for a range of price points from value products through ultra premium brands. Our protein and starch food\ningredients serve a host of functional, nutritional, and sensory benefits for a wide range of food products to serve the consumer packaged goods industry. Our ingredients\nproducts are sold directly, or through distributors, to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries.\nMission Statement. Our mission is to secure our future by consistently delivering superior financial results by more fully participating in all levels of the alcohol and food\ningredients segments for the betterment of our shareholders, employees, partners, consumers, and communities.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR SEGMENTS\nWe report three operating segments: Distilling Solutions, Branded Spirits, and Ingredient Solutions.\nDistilling Solutions Segment. We process corn and other grains (including rye, barley, wheat, barley malt, and milo) into food grade alcohol and distillery co-products, such as\ndistillers feed (commonly called dried distillers grain in the industry), fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil, which have historically been produced at our distilleries in Atchison,\nKansas, Lawrenceberg, Indiana, and Bardstown, Kentucky. We also provide warehouse services, including barrel put away, barrel storage, and barrel retrieval services, as well\nas blending services. We have certain contracts with customers to supply distilled products (or “distillate”), as well as certain contracts with customers to provide barreling and\nwarehousing services. Contracts with customers may be monthly, annual, or multi-year in term with periodic reviews of pricing. Sales to customers may also be made on the\nspot market with contracts in the form of purchase orders. Sales of co-products are primarily made on the spot market. During 2023, our five largest Distilling Solutions\ncustomers, combined, accounted for approximately 17 percent of our consolidated sales.\n1\nOn July 13, 2023, we announced the decision by our Board of Directors to approve the closure of our distillery located in Atchison, Kansas (the “Atchison Distillery”). The\nAtchison Distillery ceased operations during December 2023. The decision to close the Atchison Distillery is consistent with our plan to address profitability headwinds\nassociated with our GNS and industrial alcohol products. Future production and sales of white goods, industrial alcohol, fuel grade alcohol, and related co-products will be\nsignificantly reduced as a result of this closure.\nFood Grade Alcohol - The majority of our distillery capacities are dedicated to the production of high quality, high purity food grade alcohol for beverage applications and,\nprior to the Atchison Distillery closure, industrial applications.\nFood grade alcohol sold for beverage applications, premium beverage alcohol, consists primarily of premium bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys (“brown goods”) and GNS,\nincluding vodka and gin (“white goods”). Our premium brown goods are created by distilling grains, including corn and rye. Our brown goods are sold as aged and unaged\ndistillate, which may be further aged by our customers or warehoused at our facilities. Our GNS is sold in bulk quantities. Our gin is primarily created by redistilling GNS\ntogether with proprietary formulations of botanicals or botanical oils.\nFood grade industrial alcohol is used as an ingredient in foods (e.g., vinegar and food flavorings), personal care products (e.g., hair sprays and hand sanitizers), cleaning\nsolutions, pharmaceuticals, and a variety of other products. We sell food grade industrial alcohol in tank truck or rail car quantities direct to a number of industrial processing\ncustomers. Prior to the closure, we produced food grade industrial alcohol at our Atchison Distillery.\nFuel grade alcohol - Fuel grade alcohol is sold primarily for blending with gasoline to increase the octane and oxygen levels of the gasoline. Fuel grade alcohol can serve as a\nsubstitute for lead and petroleum-based octane enhancers and has been used in gasoline to meet certain environmental regulations and laws. Prior to the closure, we produced\nfuel grade alcohol as a co-product of our food grade alcohol business at our Atchison Distillery.\nDistillers feed and related co-products - The bulk alcohol co-products sales include distillers feed and corn oil. Distillers feed is principally derived from the mash from\nalcohol processing operations. The mash is sold primarily to processors of animal feed as a high protein additive primarily as dried distillers feed. Prior to the closure, we\nproduced corn oil as a value added co-product through a corn oil extraction process at our Atchison Distillery.\nWarehouse services - Customers who purchase barreled distillate may, and in most cases do, also enter into separate warehouse service agreements with us for the storage and\nhandling of product for aging. Services under warehouse agreements include barrel put away, barrel storage, and barrel retrieval, as well as blending services.\nBranded Spirits Segment. Our Branded Spirits segment consists of a portfolio of high quality brands, which we produce through our distilleries and bottling facilities and sell\nto distributors pursuant to customer contracts and purchase orders. MGP’s branded spirits include a wide spectrum of brands across numerous categories and price tiers. During\n2023, our five largest Branded Spirits customers, combined, accounted for approximately 18 percent of our consolidated sales. During 2023, one customer of the Branded\nSpirits segment accounted for approximately 11 percent of our consolidated sales.\nThe Premium Plus price tiers consist of brands within the Ultra Premium, Super Premium and Premium price tier categories.\nUltra Premium - Ultra premium branded spirits include brands such as Yellowstone® Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Remus® Gatsby Reserve Bourbon, Penelope®\nPrivate Select Whiskey, Remus Repeal Reserve® Bourbon, Blood Oath® Bourbon, Rebel® 10 Year Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, and Old Ezra® 7 Year\nKentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey.\nSuper Premium - Super premium branded spirits include brands such as Penelope® Four Grain Bourbon, Dos Primos® Tequila, Ezra Brooks® 99 Proof Kentucky Straight\nBourbon Whiskey, Remus® Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Minor Case® Straight Rye Whiskey, Rossville Union® Straight Rye Whiskey, The Quiet Man® Irish Whiskey, and\nGreen Hat® Gin.\nPremium - Premium branded spirits include brands such as Everclear® grain alcohol, Rebel® 100 Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, and Saint Brendan’s® Irish\nCream Liqueur. Additionally, premium includes El Mayor® Tequila, which is produced with our joint ventures, DGL Destiladores, S.de R.L. de C.V. (“DGL”) and Agricola\nLG, S.de R.L. de C.V. (“Agricola”, and together with DGL, “LMX” ).\nMid - Mid branded spirits include brands such as Brady’s® Irish Cream, Pearl® Vodka, and Lord Calvert® Canadian Whisky. Additionally, mid includes Exotico® Tequila,\nwhich is produced with our joint venture, DGL.\n2\nValue - Value branded spirits include brands such as Arrow® Cordials, Canada House® Canadian Whisky, Lady Bligh® Rum, and Juarez® Tequila.\nOther - Other includes private label products sold primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Niche Drinks, Co., Ltd, retail sales at our distilleries, and contract bottling.\nPrivate label products are processed, bottled, and distributed by us for sales under another company’s brand. We operate visitor centers with retail locations at two of our\ndistilleries, Limestone Branch Distillery® in Lebanon, Kentucky, and Lux Row Distillers® in Bardstown, Kentucky. Contract bottling is a service provided to a customer to\nprocess and bottle spirits for brands not owned by the Company.\nIngredient Solutions Segment. Our Ingredient Solutions segment consists primarily of specialty wheat starches, specialty wheat proteins, commodity wheat starches, and\ncommodity wheat proteins products which are sold to customers pursuant to purchase orders. In our efforts to best serve our customers and maximize returns to stockholders, we\nhave strategically been migrating our sales towards higher price, higher margin specialty wheat products. During 2023, our five largest Ingredient Solutions customers,\ncombined, accounted for approximately 11 percent of our consolidated sales.\nSpecialty Wheat Starches - Wheat starch is the carbohydrate-bearing portion of wheat flour. We produce a premium wheat starch powder by extracting the starch from the\nstarch slurry. We use proprietary processing steps to purify and clean impurities from the starch, and then dry the starch using spray, flash, or drum dryers. A substantial\nportion of our premium wheat starch is processed to produce certain unique specialty wheat starches designed for special applications. We sell our specialty wheat starches on\na global basis, primarily to food processors and distributors.\nWe primarily market our specialty wheat starches under the trademarks Fibersym® Resistant Starch series and FiberRite® RW Resistant Starch. These flagship brands are FDA\napproved dietary fibers and are useful in creating lower net carb baked goods for many industrial bakers and pasta makers. Our other specialty starches are used primarily for\nfood applications to improve their nutritional profile, appearance, texture, tenderness, taste, palatability, cooking temperature, stability, viscosity, binding, and freeze-thaw\ncharacteristics. Important physical properties contributed by specialty wheat starch include whiteness, clean flavor, viscosity, and texture.\nSpecialty Wheat Proteins - We have developed a number of specialty wheat proteins for food applications. Specialty wheat proteins are created from vital wheat gluten\nthrough a variety of proprietary processes which change its molecular structure. Specialty wheat proteins for food applications include the products Arise® and Proterra®.\nWe produce clean label ingredients under our Arise® line of wheat protein isolates. Along with Arise® 8000, this series includes Arise® 8100 and Arise® 8200. Each of these\ningredients is also Non-Genetically Modified Organism (“Non-GMO”) Project Verified. We also offer a Non-GMO Project Verified food ingredients portfolio of Proterra®\n1000, Proterra® 2000, and plant protein combinations textured and ready for meat replacement applications. Additionally, we offer gluten-free textured pea proteins within the\nProterra® portfolio of products.\nCommodity Wheat Starches - As is the case with value added wheat starches, our commodity wheat starches have both food and non-food applications, but such applications\nare more limited than those of value added wheat starches. These are clean label starches and are minimally processed. They have a simple and clean ingredient declaration,\nwhich is a benefit for food formulators. Market place prices generally track the fluctuations in the overall starch market in this category. However, wheat starch has unique\nfunctions in wheat based food formulations and provides for a cleaner more neutral flavor profile in finished goods.\nCommodity Wheat Proteins - Commodity wheat protein, or vital wheat gluten, is a free-flowing light tan powder which contains approximately 75 percent protein. When we\nprocess wheat flour to derive starch, we also derive vital wheat gluten. Vital wheat gluten is added by bakeries and food processors to baked goods, such as breads, and to pet\nfoods, cereals, processed meats, and fish and poultry to improve the nutritional content, texture, strength, shape, and volume of the product. The neutral flavor and color of\nvital wheat gluten also enhances the flavor and color of certain foods. The cohesiveness and elasticity of the gluten enables the dough in wheat and other high protein breads\nto rise and to support added ingredients, such as whole cracked grains, raisins and fibers. This allows bakers to make an array of different breads by varying the gluten content\nof the dough. Vital wheat gluten is also added to white breads, hot dog buns, and hamburger buns to improve the strength and cohesiveness of the product. This wheat protein\nis also the starter material used to create our textured wheat product line branded under Proterra®.\n3\nCOMPETITIVE CONDITION\nWhile we believe that the overall market environment offers growth opportunities for us in 2024 and beyond, the markets in which our products are sold are competitive. Our\nproducts compete against similar products of many large and small companies. In our Distilling Solutions segment, competition is based primarily on product innovation,\nproduct characteristics, functionality, price, service, and quality factors, such as flavor. In our Branded Spirits segment, competition is based primarily on product innovation,\nprice, brand recognition, product distribution, retail positioning, and quality factors, such as flavor. In our Ingredient Solutions segment, competition is based primarily on\nproduct innovation, product characteristics, price, brand, color, flavor, or other properties that affect how the ingredient is being used.\nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND LICENSES\nOur patent-related activities exist primarily within our Ingredient Solutions segment. We have filed patent applications and have obtained issued patents in several countries to\nprotect a range of inventions developed in our research and development efforts, including inventions relating to our products. Some of these patent filings cover significant\nproduct formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. We have trademark protection, both in terms of registrations and common law rights, for the majority of\nthe brands we produce within our Branded Spirits and Ingredient Solutions segments. We believe our trademark rights are critical to the success of the brands we produce and\nthe marketing of those products.\nSEASONALITY\nSales for some of our products, including brown goods and branded spirits, can fluctuate from period to period due to the inherent demands and timing of our customers and\nconsumer needs. Within our diversified Branded Spirits portfolio, there are certain product lines, limited offerings, and categories that experience varying demand during\ncertain periods throughout the year. Other than these product lines, our sales, on average, are generally not seasonal.\nTRANSPORTATION\nHistorically, our products have been transported to customers by truck and rail, most of which is provided by common carriers. We use third-party transportation companies to\nhelp us manage truck and rail carriers who deliver our products to our North American customers as well as overseas shipments to our international customers.\nRAW MATERIALS AND PACKAGING MATERIALS\nOur principal Distilling Solutions segment raw materials, or input costs, are corn and other grains (including rye, barley, wheat, barley malt, and milo), which are processed into\nfood grade alcohol and distillery co-products consisting of distillers feed, fuel grade alcohol, and corn oil. Our principal Branded Spirits segment raw materials, or input costs,\ninclude corn and other grains (including rye, barley, wheat, barley malt, and milo), agave, and flavoring. Our principal Ingredient Solutions segment raw material is wheat flour,\nwhich is processed into starches and proteins. The cost of grain has, at times, been subject to substantial fluctuation.\nOur principal packaging material for our Distilling Solutions segment is oak barrels. Both new and used barrels are utilized for the aging of premium brown goods. We purchase\noak barrels from multiple suppliers and some customers supply their own barrels. Our packaging for our Branded Spirits segment includes oak barrels, glass bottles,\npolyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) containers, caps, labels, aluminum cans, and cartons.\nENERGY\nNatural gas is an input cost used to operate boilers to make steam heat. We procure natural gas for our facilities in the open market from various suppliers. We have a risk\nmanagement program whereby we may purchase contracts for delivery of natural gas into the future at negotiated prices based on several factors, or we can purchase futures\ncontracts on the exchange. Historically, prices of natural gas have been higher in the late fall and winter months than during other periods.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a total of 705 employees. A collective bargaining agreement, covering 84 employees at the Atchison facility, expires on August 31, 2024. A\ncollective bargaining agreement, covering 73 employees at the Lawrenceburg facility, expires on October 24, 2027. A collective bargaining agreement, covering 52 employees\nat the St. Louis facility, that was due to expire on February 29, 2024, was successfully renewed until February 28, 2029. We have not experienced any recent work stoppages,\nand we consider our relationship with our employees, both union and non-union, to be good.\n4\nWe believe our employees are key to achieving our business objectives. Our key human capital measures include employee safety, employee retention, absenteeism,\nprofessional development, and productivity. At the Board of Directors level, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our Board is responsible for overseeing\nmatters related to human capital management. We frequently benchmark our compensation practices and benefit programs against those of comparable industries and in the\ngeographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled and\nunskilled labor throughout our organization. Our notable health, welfare, and retirement benefits for our U.S. employees include:\n• Company subsidized health insurance and wellness rewards\n• Enhanced Employee Assistance Programs\n• 401(k) Plan with Company matching contributions\n• Tuition assistance program\n• Paid time off\n• Charitable giving program with Company matching of employee donations\nEmployee safety is one of our top priorities. We develop and administer company-wide policies designed to ensure the safety of each team member and compliance with\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards.\nOur Company strives for workforce retention. We have programs for continuing education, professional development at all levels of the organization, and also provide tuition\nreimbursement assistance. New and open positions are posted for our current workforce to apply for and internal promotions are encouraged.\nWe strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment. We have robust equal employment\nopportunity and anti-discrimination policies, and in 2023 our U.S. employees completed mandatory training focused on respect in the workplace and our anti-discrimination\npolicies. Our employees have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline. Our policies require all reports\nof inappropriate behavior to be promptly investigated with appropriate action taken.\nREGULATION\nWe are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. Our operations are also subject\nto regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau (“TTB”), OSHA, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United\nStates Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and by various U.S. state and local and foreign authorities. Such laws and regulations cover virtually every aspect of our\noperations, including production and storage facilities, distillation and maturation requirements, importing ingredients, distribution of beverage alcohol products, marketing,\npricing, labeling, packaging, advertising, water usage, waste water discharge, disposal of hazardous wastes and emissions, and other matters. In addition, beverage alcohol\nproducts are subject to customs, duties, or excise taxation in many countries, including taxation at the federal, state, and local level in the U.S.\n5\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nOur executive officers as of February 22, 2024:\nName Age Principal Occupation and Business Experience\nDavid S.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from forward looking statements. The following discussion\nidentifies those which we consider to be most important. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently\ndeem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCOMMERCIAL, COMPETITION, AND INDUSTRY RISKS\nChanges in consumer preferences and purchases, and our ability to anticipate or react to them, could negatively affect our business results.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and our success depends on our continued ability to offer our customers and consumers appealing, high-quality products. Customer\nand consumer preferences and purchases may shift due to a host of factors, many of which are difficult to predict, including:\n• demographic and social trends;\n• economic conditions;\n• product innovations;\n• public health policies and initiatives (including dietary guidelines regarding alcohol consumption);\n• health and wellness trends (including the use of GLP-1 drugs);\n• changes in government regulation and taxation of beverage alcohol products;\n• the expansion of, legalization of, and increased acceptance or use of marijuana; and\n• changes in travel, leisure, dining, entertaining, and beverage consumption trends.\nOur success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new brands,\nproducts, and product innovations. If our customers and consumers shift away from spirits (particularly brown spirits, such as our bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys) or shift\nfrom purchasing our higher-margin products to our lower-margin products, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n6\nThe markets for our products are very competitive, and our business could be negatively affected if we do not compete effectively.\nThe markets for our products are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these markets have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources, and several are much\nlarger enterprises than us. Many of our current and potential competitors have larger customer bases, greater name recognition, and broader product offerings. In recent years,\nthe industries in which we compete have continued to experience consolidation. Industry consolidation can have varying degrees of impact, including the creation of new and\nlarger competitors. We are dependent on being able to generate sales and other operating income in excess of the costs of products sold in order to obtain margins, profits, and\ncash flows to meet or exceed our targeted financial performance measures. Competition is based on such factors as product innovation, product characteristics, product taste and\nquality, pricing, color, and name and brand image.\nPricing of our products is partly dependent upon industry capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring online idled capacity or to build new production capacity.\nIf market conditions make our Branded Spirits products too expensive or our distilled solutions or specialty ingredients products too expensive for use in consumer goods, our\nrevenues could be affected. If our principal competitors were to decrease their pricing, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and\nprofitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues could be adversely affected due to the potential loss of sales.\nDamage to our reputation, or that of any of our key customers or their brands, could affect our business performance.\nThe success of our products depends in part upon the positive image that consumers have of our brands and the third-party brands that use our products. Product contamination,\nwhether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our or our customers’ products could affect\nthe demand for our or our customers’ products.\nUnfavorable media, whether accurate or not, related to our industry, to us, our products, our brands, our customers’ products, marketing, personnel, operations, business\nperformance, or prospects could negatively affect our reputation, stock price, ability to attract and retain high-quality talent, or the performance of our business. Negative\npublicity or commentary on social media outlets, whether accurate or not, could cause consumers to react rapidly by avoiding our products or by choosing products offered by\nour competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If our environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”)\nor sustainability positions or practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, stock price, ability to\nattract and retain high-quality talent, and the performance of our business may be negatively affected. Similarly, stakeholders and others who disagree with our ESG or\nsustainability actions, positions, or statements may speak negatively or advocate against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations.\nA failure to introduce successful new brands and products or have effective marketing or advertising could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to innovate and develop new brands and products, and customer demands may require us to make internal investments to achieve or\nsustain competitive advantages and meet customer expectations. The launch and ongoing success of new brands and products are inherently uncertain, especially with regard to\ntheir appeal to consumers, and can give rise to a variety of costs. An unsuccessful launch or short-lived popularity of our product innovations, among other things, may affect\nconsumer perception of existing brands or products and our reputation and may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.\nWe could also be adversely affected if we are not successful in developing new brands or products as a result of new brand or product introductions by our competitors. Some\nof our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, making them better positioned to pursue new investment opportunities.\nA failure to sufficiently innovate or maintain adequate and effective marketing or advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain our brand relevance and drive product sales. If\nour competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media, or marketing expenses increase, if our advertising and promotions become less\neffective than those of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight, our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n7\nA change in public opinion about alcohol or our products could reduce demand for our brands and products.\nFor many years, there has been a high level of social and political attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry. The attention has focused largely on public health\nconcerns related to alcohol abuse, including drunk driving, underage drinking, and the negative health impacts of beverage alcohol. Anti-alcohol groups have, in the past,\nadvocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements, higher taxes, and other regulations and educational campaigns designed to discourage alcohol consumption.\nMore restrictive regulations, higher taxes, negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption, or changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of\nbeverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption of alcohol, and thus, the demand for our brands and products. This could, in turn, decrease our revenues and our revenue\ngrowth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition, consumer preferences might change and could lead to a decreased demand for our Ingredient Solutions products. For example, in recent years, we have noticed\nshifting consumer preferences and media attention directed to gluten, gluten intolerance, and “clean label” products. This could decrease our revenues and revenue growth,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFailure of our distributors to distribute our branded spirits adequately within their territories could adversely affect our business.\nWe are required by law in the U.S. to use state-licensed distributors or, in 17 states known as “control states,” state-owned agencies performing this function, to distribute our\nbranded spirits to retail outlets, including liquor stores, bars, restaurants and national chains. We have established relationships for our branded spirits with a limited number of\nwholesale distributors, and one wholesale distributor represented approximately 11 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2023. Failure to maintain those relationships could\nsignificantly and adversely affect our business, sales, and growth.\nOver the past decade there has been increasing consolidation, both intrastate and interstate, among U.S. distributors. As a result, many U.S. states now have only two or three\nsignificant distributors. Also, there are several distributors that now control distribution for several states. If we fail to maintain good relations with a distributor, our branded\nspirits could, in some instances be frozen out of one or more markets entirely. The ultimate success of our branded spirits also depends in large part on our distributors’ ability\nand desire to distribute and actively promote our branded spirits to our desired U.S. target markets, as we rely significantly on them for product placement and retail store\npenetration. In addition, all of our distributors also distribute competitive brands and product lines. We cannot assure you that our U.S. distributors will continue to purchase our\nbranded spirits, resell them at our desired or targeted prices, commit sufficient time and resources to promote and market our brands and product lines, or that they can or will\nsell them to our desired or targeted markets. If they do not, our sales will be harmed, resulting in a decline in our results of operations.\nMoreover, the retail industry, particularly in Europe, North America, and other countries in which we operate or may operate in the future, continues to consolidate, resulting in\nlarger retailers with increased purchasing power, which may affect our competitiveness in these markets. Larger retailers may seek to improve their profitability and sales by\nasking for lower prices or increased trade spending. The efforts of retailers could result in reduced profitability for the distilled spirits industry as a whole and indirectly\nadversely affect our financial results.\nOur focus on higher margin specialty ingredients may make us more reliant on fewer, more profitable customer relationships.\nOur strategic plan for our Ingredient Solutions segment includes focusing our efforts on the sale of specialty proteins and starches to targeted consumer packaged goods\ncustomers, which may make our Ingredient Solutions segment reliant on these customer relationships. In addition, our business, financial condition, or results of operations\ncould be materially adversely affected if our Ingredient Solutions customers were to reduce their new product development (“NPD”) activities or cease using our products in\ntheir NPD efforts.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nAn interruption of operations or a catastrophic event at our facilities could negatively affect our business.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage for various property damage and loss events, including business interruption insurance, an interruption in or loss of operations at any\nof our production facilities could reduce or postpone production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition. In the past, we have experienced short term interruptions of operations at some of our production facilities due to industrial accidents. Any\n8\nfuture accidents or other catastrophic events could result in an extended interruption or reduction of production at our facilities, and we may incur costs or financial losses that\nare either not insured against or not fully covered through our insurance.\nOur customers store a substantial amount of barreled inventory of aged or aging bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys at our warehouses. If a catastrophic event were to occur at our\nfacilities or our warehouses (including any leased warehouses), our customers’ business could be adversely affected. The loss of a significant amount of aged or aging inventory\nat these facilities through fire, natural disaster, or otherwise could result in customer claims against us, liability for customer losses, and a reduction of warehouse services\nrevenue.\nWe also store a substantial amount of our own inventory of aged or aging bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys at our warehouses and at the facilities of certain third-party\nproducers. If a catastrophic event were to occur at any of these locations, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected. The loss of a\nsignificant amount of our aged or aging inventory at these facilities through fire, natural disaster, or otherwise could result in a reduction in supply of the affected product or\nproducts and could affect our long-term performance of any affected brands.\nTo the extent that our products rely on unique or proprietary processes or techniques, replacing production lost as a result of a catastrophic event by purchasing from outside\nsuppliers would be difficult.\nOur strategic plan involves significant investment in the aging of barreled distillate. Decisions concerning the quantity of maturing stock of our aged distillate could\nmaterially affect our future profitability.\nThere is an inherent risk in determining the quantity of maturing stock of aged distillate to lay down in a given year for future sales as a result of changes in consumer demand,\npricing, new brand launches, changes in product cycles, increase in competitive supply, and other factors. Demand for products could change significantly between the time of\nproduction and the date of sale. It may be more difficult to make accurate predictions regarding new products and brands. Inaccurate decisions or estimations could lead to an\ninability to supply future demand or lead to a future surplus of inventory and consequent write down in the value of aged or aging distillate. As a result, our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWarehouse expansion issues could negatively impact our operations and our business.\nExpansion of our business operations requires additional warehouse capacity. In the event additional warehouse capacity is required, there is the risk of completion delays, the\nrisk of cost overruns, and regulatory risks, including our ability to timely obtain necessary approvals and permits, and potential changes in laws and regulations, including\nzoning and environmental requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe have a high concentration of certain raw material and finished goods purchases from a limited number of suppliers, which exposes us to risk.\nWe have third-party supply agreements for our grain supply (primarily corn) and wheat flour. We also procure some textured wheat proteins through a third-party toll\nmanufacturer in the U.S. Additionally, we procure barrels, glass, PET containers, caps, labels, aluminum cans, cartons, bottle closures, and other products from third-party\nvendors. If any of our key suppliers encounters an operational or financial issue, is no longer able to meet our timing, quality, or capacity requirements, ceases doing business\nwith us, or significantly raises prices, and we are not able to promptly develop alternative cost-effective sources of supply or production, it could lead to an interruption in\nsupply to us and higher prices than those we have negotiated or than are available in the market at the time, and in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nWork disruptions or stoppages by our unionized workforce could cause interruptions in our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 209 of our 705 employees were members of a union. Although our relations with our three unions are stable, there is no assurance that\nwe will not experience work disruptions or stoppages in the future, which could interrupt our operations, adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n9\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business or operations, and water scarcity or quality\ncould negatively impact our production costs and capacity.\nIncreasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the\nfrequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. In the event that climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures enacted to address climate\nchange, has a negative effect on agricultural productivity in the regions from which we procure agricultural products such as corn and wheat, we could be subject to decreased\navailability or increased prices for these agricultural products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIncreasing regulation of emissions could increase the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby\nsubstantially increasing the production, distribution, and supply chain costs associated with our products. Climate change could also lead to disruptions in the production or\ndistribution of our products.\nWater is the main ingredient in substantially all of our distillery products and is also necessary for the production of our food ingredients. It is also a limited resource, facing\nchallenges from climate change, increasing pollution, and poor management. As demand for water continues to increase, water becomes more scarce and the quality of available\nwater deteriorates, we may be affected by increasing production costs or capacity constraints, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nor results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from the announced planned closure of our Atchison, Kansas distillery.\nOn July 13, 2023, we announced the planned closure of our distillery located in Atchison, Kansas, and we closed this distillery in December 2023. The anticipated future impact\nof this closure, including with respect to the ultimate disposal of the distillery assets and impacts to our Ingredient Solutions business, is subject to assumptions, estimates, and\nother uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays or unanticipated costs associated with the\nclosure, or if other unanticipated events or unintended consequences occur in connection with the closure, our business and financial results could be adversely affected and\ncould differ materially from our expectations.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY, AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and taxation, as well as compliance with existing or future laws and regulations, which may require us to incur substantial\nexpenditures.\nWe are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. Our operations are also subject to\nregulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the TTB, OSHA, the FDA, the EPA, and by various U.S. state and local and foreign authorities. We are also required to\nconduct business only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute, and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other\ngovernmental regulations applicable to our industry will not change or become more stringent. These laws and regulations cover virtually every aspect of our operations,\nincluding production and storage/warehouse facilities, distillation, and maturation requirements, importing ingredients, importing and exporting our products, distribution of\nbeverage alcohol products, marketing, pricing, labeling, packaging, advertising, trade practices, water usage, wastewater discharge, disposal of hazardous wastes and emissions,\nair emissions and quality, and other matters.\nViolations of any of these laws and regulations may result, and have in the past resulted, in administrative, civil, or criminal fines or penalties being levied against us, including\ntemporary or prolonged cessation of production, revocation or modification of permits, performance of environmental investigatory or remedial activities, voluntary or\ninvoluntary product recalls, or a cease and desist order against operations that are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nChanges in laws, regulatory measures, governmental policies, guidelines, initiatives, or the manner in which current ones are interpreted or applied, could cause us to incur\nmaterial additional costs or liabilities and jeopardize the growth of our business in the affected market. Specifically, we could be required to incur significant additional capital\nexpenditures, increase our operating expenses, or change the manner in which we conduct our business in response to new environmental, food, health, or safety related laws\nand regulations. In addition, governments may prohibit, impose, or increase limitations on advertising and promotional activities, or times or locations where beverage alcohol\nmay be sold or consumed, or adopt other measures that could limit our opportunities to reach consumers or sell our products. Certain countries historically have banned all\ntelevision, newspaper, magazine, and digital commerce/advertising for beverage alcohol products. Increases in regulation of this nature could substantially reduce consumer\nawareness of our products in the affected markets and make the introduction of new products more challenging. Governmental agencies may issue dietary guidelines that\nrecommend reduced alcohol\n10\nconsumption, which could impact consumer behavior. These matters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTariffs imposed by the U.S. and those imposed by other countries, as well as rapidly changing trade relations, could negatively impact our customers and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign governments’ trade policies have resulted in, and may continue to result in, tariffs on imports into and exports from the countries where we operate.\nFor example, during the period from 2018 through mid-year 2022, the United Kingdom and the European Union imposed tariffs on the import of American whiskey in response\nto tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from several countries, including those in the European Union. These tariffs are currently slated to be reinstated and doubled if an\nagreement is not reached by March 31, 2025. Similar retaliatory tariffs may be implemented in the future. Any further deterioration of economic relations between the U.S. and\nother countries or any increase in existing tariffs or the imposition of additional tariffs could result in an increase in the price of our and our customer’s products in those\ncountries, could prompt consumers in those countries to seek alternative products, could result in a supply imbalance in the U.S if we and our competitors have reduced sales in\nthose countries, and could potentially impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges in excise taxes, incentives, and customs duties related to products containing alcohol could adversely affect our business.\nProducts containing alcohol are subject to excise taxation in U.S. markets at the federal, state, and local level. Any increase in federal, state or local excise taxes could have an\nadverse effect on our business by increasing prices and reducing demand, particularly if excise tax levels increase substantially relative to those for beer and wine. In addition,\nproducts containing alcohol are the subject of customs duties in many countries around the world. An unanticipated increase in customs duties in the markets where we may sell\nour products could also adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and\nwe rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our\nproprietary rights. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights also\nmay take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial\nand managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or\nmisappropriating our proprietary rights. Our intellectual property rights may not be upheld if challenged. Such results could materially and adversely affect our business. If we\nare unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we may lose any competitive advantage provided by our intellectual property. We and our customers and\nother users of our products may be subject to allegations that we or they or certain uses of our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Litigation is\ncostly to defend and the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to\nresolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan, and could require us or our customers or other users of our products to change business practices,\npay monetary damages, or enter into licensing or similar arrangements. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could be material to our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFailure of our branded spirits to secure and maintain listings in control states could adversely affect our business.\nIn control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products\nselected for listing in control states must generally reach certain volumes or profit levels to maintain their listings. Products in control states are selected for purchase and sale\nthrough listing procedures, which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Products not selected for listings can only be\npurchased by consumers in the applicable control state through special orders, if at all. If, in the future, we are unable to maintain our current listings in the control states, or\nsecure and maintain listings in those states for any additional branded spirits we may develop or acquire, sales of our branded spirits could decrease significantly, which would\nhave a material adverse financial effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n11\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products could inhibit sales of affected products.\nVarious jurisdictions have adopted or may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our products relating\nto the content or perceived adverse health consequences of some of our products. Several of these labeling regulations or laws require warnings on any product with substances\nthat the jurisdiction lists as potentially associated with cancer or birth defects and heightened requirements could be imposed. If additional or more severe requirements of this\ntype are imposed on one or more of our major products under current or future health, environmental, or other laws or regulations, they could inhibit sales of such products.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether our products will become subject to increased rules and regulations, which, if enacted, could increase our costs or adversely impact sales.\nFor example, advocacy groups in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom have called for the consideration of requiring the sale of alcohol in plain packaging with more\ncomprehensive health warnings or have launched additional health-related campaigns in an effort to change drinking habits in those countries. This could result in additional\ngovernmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling, or availability of our products, any of which could damage our reputation, make our brands\nunrecognizable, or reduce demand of our products, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nProduct recalls or other product liability claims could materially and negatively affect our business.\nSelling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration.\nWe could decide to, or be required to, recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination, adulteration, misbranding, tampering, or other errors or\ndeficiencies. Although we maintain product recall insurance, product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product\ninventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time, and we may incur costs or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully\ncovered through our insurance. We could be adversely affected if our customers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products, or if consumers lose\nconfidence in the food and beverage safety system generally. Negative attention about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation, discourage\nfood processors, branded spirits bottlers, or consumers from buying our products, or cause production and delivery disruptions.\nWe may also suffer losses if our products or operations cause injury, illness, or death. In addition, we could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A\nsignificant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us, or a significant product recall, may materially and adversely affect our\nreputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability or other legal or regulatory claim is unsuccessful, has no merit, or is not pursued, the negative publicity\nsurrounding assertions against our products or processes and the associated legal and other expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nor results of operations.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions, and restrictions, or similar laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial results.\nWe market and sell our products in over 45 countries. Some of the countries where we do business have a higher risk of corruption than others. While we are committed to doing\nbusiness in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and restrictions, and other similar laws and regulations, along with our Code of Conduct and our\nother policies, we remain subject to the risk that an employee, or one of our business partners, may take action determined to be in violation of international trade, money\nlaundering, anti-corruption, or other laws, sanctions, or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or equivalent laws.\nAny determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, particularly those related to anti-corruption and international trade,\ncould result in investigations, interruption of business, loss of business partner relationships, suspension or termination of licenses and permits (our own or those of our\npartners), imposition of fines, legal or equitable sanctions, negative publicity, and management distraction. Any media coverage associated with misconduct under these laws\nand regulations, even if unwarranted or baseless, could damage our reputation and sales. Further, our continued compliance with applicable anti-corruption or other laws or\nregulations, our Code of Conduct, and our other policies could result in higher operating costs.\nWe also operate our business and market our products in countries that may be subject to export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions and other forms of trade\nrestrictions. New or expanded export control regulations, economic sanctions, embargoes or other forms of trade restrictions imposed on countries in which we or our associates\ndo business may curtail our existing business and may result in serious economic challenges in these geographies, which could have a material adverse effect on our and our\nassociates’ operations, and may result in impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. For example, the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries\nimposed significant new sanctions and export controls against Russia, Russian banks and certain Russian individuals following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and additional\nsanctions or\n12\nfurther punitive actions may be implemented in the future. The conflict and related sanctions have resulted and could continue to result in disruptions to global trade, commodity\nmarkets (including grain, corn, wheat, energy, and natural gas markets), and supply chain continuity.\nClass action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adversely affect our business.\nCompanies in our industry may face the possibility of class action or similar litigation alleging that the continued excessive use or abuse of beverage alcohol has caused death or\nserious health problems. It is also possible that governments could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government funded health care costs. Litigation or\nassertions of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry, and it is possible that we, as well as our distributors, customers, or suppliers, could be named\nin litigation of this type.\nAlso, lawsuits have been brought in a number of U.S. states against beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers alleging improper alcohol marketing, advertising, or\ndistribution practices, including improperly targeting underage consumers in their advertising. While we have not been named in these lawsuits, we could be named in similar\nlawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend against, deplete our cash, divert our personnel\nresources and, if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail, could harm our business significantly.\nGENERAL RISKS\nHigher costs or unavailability of raw materials, product ingredients, energy resources, or labor could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur ability to make and sell our products depends upon the availability of raw materials and energy resources. Prices and supply of all products are subject to market forces,\nsuch as weather, changes in domestic and global demand and supply, and global political or economic issues, including repercussions from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nHigher costs or insufficient availability of suitable grain, agave, water, wood, glass, plastics, closures, and other input materials, or higher associated labor costs or insufficient\navailability of labor, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Similarly, when energy costs rise, our transportation,\nfreight, and other operating costs, such as distilling and bottling expenses, also may increase. Our freight cost and the timely delivery of our products could be adversely affected\nby a number of factors that could reduce the profitability of our operations, including driver or equipment shortages, higher fuel costs, weather conditions, traffic congestion,\nshipment container availability, rail shut down, increased government regulation, and other matters.\nIn addition, the relationship between the price we pay for corn and the sales price of distillers feed, the principal co-product of our alcohol production process, can fluctuate\nsignificantly and negatively impact our business. The selling price of distillers feed has historically tracked the price of corn, but is also susceptible to other factors, including\nweather, other available feedstock, and global trade relations. As a result, the profitability of distillers feed could be adversely affected, which could be material to our business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations.\nIf we cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased sales volume, or reductions in other costs, our profitability could be adversely affected. There\ncan be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or\nmove from purchasing our higher-margin products to our lower-margin products.\nA failure of one or more of our key information technology (“IT”) systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers could have a negative impact on\nour business.\nWe rely on IT systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, hardware (including laptops and mobile devices),\nsoftware, and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed and hosted by third-party vendors, to assist us in the management of our business. The various\nuses of these IT systems, networks, and services include hosting our internal network and communication systems; enterprise resource planning; processing transactions;\nsummarizing and reporting results of operations; business planning and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements; providing and managing\ndata security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. The Company has previously experienced, and is expected to continue to be exposed to, failures\nof our IT systems and those of our third-party vendors due to various causes, including those caused by natural disasters, power outages, computer and telecommunications\nfailures, viruses, phishing attempts, cyber-attacks, malware and\n13\nransomware attacks, security breaches, failures in maintenance or development of new IT systems, and errors by employees or vendors.\nWe have technology and processes in place designed to detect and respond to such failures and disruptions; however, because of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized\naccess, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems, and because of the unpredictable nature of other potential threats such as natural disasters, our detection and response\nmeasures may be ineffective or inadequate. In addition, increased IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems,\nnetworks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. This could lead to outside parties having access to our confidential data, strategic\ninformation, or information regarding our employees, suppliers, or customers. Ransomware attacks or other cybersecurity breaches have occurred, either internally or at our\nthird-party technology service providers, and have caused and may in the future cause us to be prevented from accessing our data, resulting in interruptions or delays in our\nbusiness, and causing us to incur remediation costs or requiring us to pay ransom to a hacker which takes over our systems, or damage our reputation. Although we maintain\ninsurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, we may incur costs or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through our insurance.\nAll of these potential failures or disruptions of our data security systems or our IT systems could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, or results\nof operations. If the IT systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, we may suffer disruptions to operations, including order processing,\ninvoicing, and production and distribution of our products, as well as reputational, competitive, or business harm, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations. If our critical IT systems or back-up systems or those of our third-party vendors were damaged or ceased to function\nproperly, we might have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them. In addition, these events could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information,\nand we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, customers, or suppliers.\nAdditionally, we could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, investigations, or regulatory enforcement actions and we could be subject to the\npayment of fines or other penalties, ransoms, legal claims by our suppliers, customers, or employees, and significant remediation costs.\nOur business may suffer from risks related to acquisitions and potential future acquisitions.\nPart of our strategic business plan is to grow our business through acquisitions, and we continue to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning potential acquisition\nopportunities, some of which could be material. For example, in April 2021 we acquired Luxco, Inc. (referred to as “Luxco” and the merger as the “Merger”) and in June 2023\nwe acquired Penelope Bourbon LLC (“Penelope”). Failure to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions could adversely impact our\nlong-term competitiveness and profitability. The integration of any acquisition involves a number of risks that could harm our financial condition, results of operations, or\ncompetitive position, including:\n• Integration plans for our acquisitions are based on benefits that involve assumptions as to future events, including our ability to successfully achieve anticipated\nsynergies, leveraging our existing relationships, as well as general business and industry conditions, many of which are beyond our control and may not materialize.\nUnforeseen factors may offset components of our integration plans in whole or in part. As a result, our actual results may vary considerably, or be considerably delayed,\ncompared to our estimates.\n• The integration process could disrupt the activities of the businesses that are being combined. The combination of companies requires, among other things, coordination\nof administrative and other functions. In addition, the loss of key employees, customers, or vendors of acquired businesses could materially and adversely impact the\nintegration of any acquired businesses.\n• The execution of our integration plans may divert the attention of our management from other key responsibilities;\n• Our financial results may be negatively impacted by cash expenses and non-cash charges incurred in connection with an acquisition if goodwill or other intangible assets\nwe acquire become impaired.\n• We may enter new markets or markets in which we have limited prior experience.\n• We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an acquisition, enhancing our vulnerability to increased debt service requirements if interest rates rise, reducing the\namount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions, and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to\nchanges in our businesses and industries.\n• We may assume unanticipated liabilities and contingencies or other exposures (including regulatory risks) for which we do not have adequate insurance coverage,\nindemnification, or other protection.\n• Our acquisitions could fail to perform in accordance with our expectations at the time of purchase.\n14\nOur ability to grow through the acquisition of additional distilled spirits brands or other businesses is also dependent upon identifying acceptable acquisition targets and\nopportunities, our ability to consummate prospective transactions on favorable terms, or at all, and the availability of capital to complete the acquisition. The pursuit of potential\nacquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether\nor not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. We intend to\nfinance our acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources, third-party financing and, in appropriate circumstances, the further issuance of equity and debt\nsecurities. Any issuance of our Common Stock or securities convertible into our Common Stock to fund an acquisition could substantially dilute the ownership percentage of\nour current stockholders and negatively impact the market price of our Common stock. For example, in connection with the Merger we issued approximately 5.0 million shares\nof our Common Stock.\nAcquiring additional distilled spirits brands or other businesses could have a significant effect on our financial position and could cause substantial fluctuations in our operating\nresults.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nOur revolving credit facility bears interest at variable rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve began raising the Federal Funds interest rate in early 2022 and continued to do so\nthroughout the first half of 2023 in response to concerns about inflation. As of December 31, 2023, the Federal Funds interest rate was at the highest level in 22 years. Although\nthe Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady since July 2023 and has pointed to potential interest rate cuts, there is no guarantee that they may again raise interest rates in\nresponse to continuing concerns about inflation. Any increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our variable rate debt and could materially reduce our\nprofitability and cash flows. In addition, higher interest rates could increase the future cost to refinance our convertible notes or the cost of financing any future acquisitions.\nAssuming our revolving credit facility was fully drawn up to the current $400 million maximum principal commitment, for each 1% increase in Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (“SOFR”) would result in a $4.0 million increase in annual interest expense under the revolving credit facility.\nIf we were to lose any of our key personnel, we may not be able to fully implement our strategic plan, and our system of internal controls could be impacted.\nWe rely on the continued services of key personnel involved in management, finance, product development, sales, manufacturing, marketing, human resources, operations, and\ndistribution, and upon the efforts and abilities of our executive management team. The loss of service of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, or on our system of internal controls.\nIf we cannot attract and retain key personnel, or if our search for qualified personnel is prolonged, our system of internal controls may be affected, which could lead to an\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, it could be difficult, time consuming, and expensive to replace any key management\nmember or other critical personnel, and no guarantee exists that we will be able to recruit suitable replacements or assimilate new key personnel into our organization.\nOur global business is subject to commercial, political, and financial risks.\nOur products are sold in more than 45 countries; accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including commercial, political, and\nfinancial risks. In addition, we are subject to potential business disruption caused by military conflicts (including the current conflicts in Ukraine and Israel); potentially unstable\ngovernments or legal systems; civil or political upheaval or unrest; local labor policies and conditions; possible expropriation, nationalization, or confiscation of assets;\nproblems with repatriation of foreign earnings; economic or trade sanctions; closure of markets to imports; anti-American sentiment; terrorism or other types of violence in or\noutside the U.S.; and health pandemics. If shipments of our products to international markets were to experience significant disruption due to these risks or for other reasons, it\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nCovenants and other provisions in our credit arrangements could hinder our ability to operate. Our failure to comply with covenants in our credit arrangements\ncould result in the acceleration of the debt extended under such agreements, limit our liquidity, and trigger other rights of our lenders.\nOur credit arrangements (Note 7, Corporate Borrowings) contain a number of financial and other covenants that include provisions which require us, in certain circumstances,\nto meet certain financial tests. These covenants could hinder our ability\n15\nto operate and could reduce our profitability. The lender may also terminate or accelerate our obligations under our credit arrangements upon the occurrence of various events in\naddition to payment defaults and other breaches. Any acceleration of our debt or termination of our credit arrangements would negatively impact our overall liquidity and might\nrequire us to take other actions to preserve any remaining liquidity. Although we anticipate that we will be able to meet the covenants in our credit arrangements, there can be no\nassurance that we will do so, as there are a number of external factors that affect our operations over which we have little or no control, that could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nPandemics or other health crises could disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our operations, including the demand for our products and our ability to produce and\ndeliver our products.\nA pandemic, such as COVID-19, or another widespread health crisis could negatively impact the global economy which could have a negative impact on our operations,\nincluding voluntary or mandatory temporary closures of our facilities or offices; interrupt our supply chain, which could impact the cost or availability of raw materials; cause\ndisruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to market and distribute our products; reduce consumer demand for our products or those of our customers due to bar and\nrestaurant closures or reduced consumer traffic in bars, restaurants, and other locations; and labor shortages.\nFurthermore, our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers could be required to comply with new regulations imposed by state and local governments in response to\nsuch an outbreak. Compliance with these new measures could cause an increase in the cost, or delay or reduce the volume, of products produced at our facilities or those of our\nsuppliers. A pandemic or other widespread health crisis could disrupt or negatively impact credit markets, which could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital. These\nimpacts could limit our ability to fund our operations and satisfy our obligations.\nWe may not pay dividends or may pay smaller dividends on our Common Stock in the future.\nThe payment of dividends, as well as the amount of any dividends, requires approval of our Board of Directors. Future dividend payments are also subject to our financial\nresults, the availability of statutory surplus funds to pay dividends, restrictions in our debt agreements, and our capital allocation strategy. These or other factors could result in a\nchange to our current policy of paying dividends on our Common Stock or may result in us paying smaller dividends on our Common Stock in the future.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nCommon Stockholders have limited rights under our Articles of Incorporation.\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation, holders of our preferred stock, par value $10.00 per share (“Preferred Stock”), are entitled to elect five of our nine directors and only\nholders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with respect to a merger, dissolution, lease, exchange or sale of substantially all of our assets, or on an amendment to the\nArticles of Incorporation, unless such action would increase or decrease the authorized shares or par value of the Common or Preferred Stock, or change the powers, preferences\nor special rights of the Common or Preferred Stock so as to affect the holders of Common Stock adversely. Generally, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock vote as separate\nclasses on all other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the majority of the outstanding shares of our Preferred Stock is beneficially owned by one individual, who is effectively in control of the election of\nfive of our nine directors under our Articles of Incorporation. Furthermore, a group of stockholders beneficially owning approximately 21 percent of our Common Stock as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (excluding shares controlled by certain other stockholders) have a right to nominate up to two of the four directors to be elected by holders of our Common\nStock pursuant to the terms of a shareholders’ agreement, provided they continue to hold a certain amount of our Common Stock, and two other individuals who beneficially\nown approximately 13 percent of our Common Stock as of December 31, 2023 have agreed to vote in favor of those nominees with respect to any shares of Common Stock\nover which they have sole voting control.\nOur two class structure with our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may prevent the inclusion of our Common Stock in certain stock market indices, may cause stockholder\nadvisory firms or others to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure, and may result\nin large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our Common Stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms, institutional investors, or others critical\nof our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Common Stock or make it difficult for us to attract and retain qualified\ndirectors. Any actions we might pursue to eliminate the Preferred Stock would require the support of the holders of our Preferred Stock and would likely involve payment to the\nholders of our\n16\nPreferred Stock for redeeming their shares, the amount of which could be material and would involve risks related to the valuation and terms of any such transaction.\nThe concentrated control of our stock and rights of holders of Preferred Stock under our Articles of Incorporation could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely these factors could result in the consummation of such a\ntransaction that our other stockholders do not support. The concentrated control of our stock and rights of holders of Preferred Stock could also discourage a potential investor\nfrom acquiring our Common Stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Preferred Stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our\nCommon Stock. In addition, the sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of shares by our principal stockholders could have an adverse effect on the market price of our\nCommon Stock.\nWe have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts, which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares for a premium in a\nchange of control transaction. In addition, we could issue additional shares of Common Stock, which could adversely impact the market price of our Common Stock.\nVarious provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and bylaws and of Kansas corporate law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control or takeover attempt of our\nCompany by a third-party which our management and Board of Directors opposes. Stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the\nopportunity to do so. These antitakeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of stockholders to benefit from a change of control or change in our management and\nBoard of Directors. These provisions include:\n• the rights of holders of our Preferred Stock under our Articles of Incorporation (see “Common Stockholders have limited rights under our Articles of Incorporation”);\n• additional shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or to\ndiscourage a third-party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock;\n• non-cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n• limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n• advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our stockholders at\nstockholder meetings.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue additional shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock and may issue the available authorized shares without notice to, or further\naction by, our stockholders, unless stockholder approval is required by law or the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. We believe that it is necessary to maintain a\nsufficient number of available authorized shares of our Common Stock in order to provide us with the flexibility to issue Common Stock for business purposes that may arise as\ndeemed advisable by our Board. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may significantly dilute the equity ownership of our current\nstockholders and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have a multi-pronged approach to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. This approach includes system testing and patching, continuous\nmonitoring, end-user training and awareness, multi-layered security, redundancy mechanisms, encryption, and internal audits and assessments. Assessment of cybersecurity risk\nis part of our overall enterprise risk management (“ERM”) process, which is reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, along with our strategies for\nmanaging our cybersecurity risks.\nWe maintain technical and organizational safeguards, including employee training, incident response capability reviews and exercises, cybersecurity insurance, and business\ncontinuity mechanisms for the protection of our assets. If faced with a cybersecurity incident, our IT team is trained to focus on responding to and containing the threat and\nminimizing any business impact, as appropriate. In the event of an incident, our IT team assesses, among other factors, safety impact, supply chain and\n17\nmanufacturing disruption, data and personal information loss, business operations disruption, projected cost, and potential for reputational harm.\nFrom time to time, our processes are audited and validated by internal and external experts. We leverage third-party cybersecurity experts with the goal of minimizing\ndisruption to our business and production operations, strengthening supply chain resilience in response to cyber-related events, and supporting the integrity of IT systems. We\nalso engage reputable third-party consultants to help evaluate and test our vulnerability to cybersecurity threats as well as to conduct annual penetration tests to help identify\nexploitable cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Our IT team assesses these testing results and implements any appropriate measures to mitigate vulnerabilities identified.\nWe have not experienced any material impacts from any cybersecurity threats or incidents in the last three fiscal years. We use each cybersecurity threat or incident as an\nopportunity to review our protocols and implement enhancements as applicable. For more information about our risks from cybersecurity threats, see Item 1A—Risk Factors—\nA failure of one or more of our key information technology (“IT”) systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers could have a negative impact on our\nbusiness.\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing risk assessments and risk management, including cybersecurity risks, and is assisted in these efforts by the Audit\nCommittee of the Board. Our IT team is responsible for assessing and managing our risks from cybersecurity threats. Our IT team is led by our Vice President of Information\nTechnology and Security, who reports directly to our Chief Financial Officer. During 2023, our Chief Information Officer (who has been serving as our Chief Commercial\nOfficer since January 2024) provided updates on cybersecurity threats and risks to our Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, the\nAudit Committee reviewed cybersecurity risks and mitigation strategies in 2023, as part of their oversight of our enterprise risk management process.\nOur Vice President of Information Technology and Security has over 25 years of experience in IT and has held a variety of IT roles across multiple business lines within the\nfinancial services, aviation, and hospitality industries. He received both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in information management and holds Certified Information Systems\nSecurity Professional (“CISSP”) certification.\nOur Vice President of Information Technology and Security monitors our processes for preventing, detecting, mitigating, and remediating cybersecurity incidents through his\nmanagement of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including through the operation of our incident response plans,\nwhich include escalation to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate.\n18\nITEM 2.

Forward-looking statements in this Report are\n20\nmade as of the date of this Report, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information made in this Report, except as required by law.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of MGP’s consolidated financial\nstatements with a narrative from the perspective of management. MGP’s MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n• Overview\n• Recent Developments\n• Results of Operations\n• Distilling Solutions Segment\n• Branded Spirits Segment\n• Ingredient Solutions Segment\n• Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n• Critical Accounting Estimates\n• New Accounting Pronouncements\nOVERVIEW\nMGP is a leading producer and supplier of premium distilled spirits, branded spirits, and food ingredients. Distilled spirits include premium bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys\n(“brown goods”) and grain neutral spirits (“GNS”), including vodka and gin. Our distilled spirits are either sold directly or indirectly to manufacturers of other branded spirits.\nMGP was also a producer of high quality industrial alcohol for use in both food and non-food applications, which was primarily produced at our distillery located in Atchison,\nKansas, prior to its closure during December 2023. We have a portfolio of our own high quality branded spirits, which we produce through our distilleries and bottling facilities\nand sell to distributors. Our branded spirits products account for a range of price points from value products through ultra premium brands. Our protein and starch food\ningredients provide a host of functional, nutritional, and sensory benefits for a wide range of food products to serve the consumer packaged goods industry. Our ingredients\nproducts are sold directly, or through distributors, to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries.\nOur strategic plan is designed to leverage our history and strengths as well as the positive macro trends we see in the industries in which we compete, while providing better\ninsulation from outside factors, including swings in commodity pricing.\nDistilling Solutions Segment\nOur Distilling Solutions segment mission is to cultivate lasting partnerships with customers across all product categories by leveraging our technical distilling expertise, strong\nsales and operating platform, aging whiskey inventory, and unique project development skills. The favorable macro industry trends we anticipate will benefit our business\ninclude the expansion in the U.S. of the distilled spirits’ share within beverage alcohol, particularly growth of the American whiskey category that has continued to expand over\nthe past several years. These macro industry trends also include shifting sales mix to higher margin products, such as premium brown goods. Our Distilling Solutions segment is\nalso subject to unfavorable macro industry trends, which include increased competition as industry participants seek to capitalize on consumer trends, inflation impacts on\ncustomers, overall American whiskey supply and consumer consumption patterns, as well as increased commodity prices. Our strategy for the Distilling Solutions segment is to\nfurther develop our existing customer relationships, expand our Kentucky whiskey sales platform, cultivate additional multi-national and craft customers for brown goods sales,\nand increase our global presence in the American whiskey market.\nDuring 2023, we continued to focus on attracting customers and developing customer relationships for our premium beverage alcohol products as well as shifting our focus\naway from industrial alcohol, fuel grade alcohol, and white beverage alcohol. Distilling Solutions segment sales for 2023 increased 5 percent over the prior year.\nBranded Spirits Segment\nOur Branded Spirits segment mission is to align our product offering and enhance focus on growing spirits categories and price tiers. The favorable macro industry trends we\nanticipate will benefit our business include growth in high-end whiskey and tequila brands as well as growth in the U.S. across all spirit categories in the premium plus price\ntiers. Our Branded Spirits segment is also subject to unfavorable macro industry trends, which include inflation impacts on consumers, and increased\n21\ncompetition as industry participants seek to capitalize on consumer trends. Our strategy for the Branded Spirits segment is to focus on the right brands at the right price points in\nthe right spirits categories to maximize profit for the Company. Additionally, our strategy is to grow our overall points of distribution, increase innovation, build brand\nawareness, and continue to invest in our people. Branded Spirits segment sales for 2023 increased 7 percent over the prior year.\nIngredient Solutions Segment\nOur Ingredient Solutions segment mission is to remain a strategic business partner of choice earning meaningful relationships through collaboration, innovation, and dedication\nto best-in-class customer service. The favorable macro industry trends we anticipate will benefit our business include growth and focus on high fiber, high protein, meat\nalternatives, plant-based protein, and non-GMO products. We continue to provide customer solutions, taking advantage of our position within growing consumer trends. Our\nstrategy for the Ingredient Solutions segment is to expand and optimize our dietary fiber, plant proteins, and clean label starches; expand our extruded products platform; and\ncontinue to innovate and expand opportunities through research and development. Ingredient Solutions segment sales for 2023 increased 14 percent over the prior year.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nAcquisition of Penelope\nOn May 8, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100 percent of the equity of Penelope, and subsequently completed the acquisition on June 1, 2023 (the\n“Acquisition”). Penelope, prior to our acquisition, was a family and founder-owned and operated American whiskey company with a diverse portfolio of high-quality whiskeys\nin the premium plus price tiers. As a result of the acquisition, we enhanced our presence in the growing American whiskey category and expanded our portfolio of premium plus\nprice tier brands. Following the acquisition, Penelope became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and its financial results are included in the Branded Spirits segment\n(see Note 4, Business Combination for additional information).\nClosure of the Atchison Distillery\nOn July 13, 2023, we announced the decision by our Board of Directors to approve the closure of our distillery located in Atchison, Kansas (the “Atchison Distillery”). The\nAtchison Distillery ceased operations in December 2023. The decision to close the Atchison Distillery is consistent with our plan to address profitability headwinds associated\nwith our GNS and industrial alcohol products within the Distilling Solutions segment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a $17,112 impairment of assets\nrelated to the Atchison Distillery closure, which was recorded in the impairment of long-lived assets and other line on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The impaired\nassets were recorded within the Distilling Solution segment. Additionally, we recorded $2,279 of expenses related to severance costs, inventory write offs, contract termination\nfees, consulting fees, and other miscellaneous expenses related to the Atchison Distillery closure, which were recorded in the impairment of long-lived assets and other line on\nthe Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023 (see Note 6, Closure of the Atchison Distillery for additional information).\n22\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated results\nThe table below details the consolidated results for 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended December 31, % Increase (Decrease)\n2023 2022 2021 2023 v. 2022 2022 v. 2021\nSales $ 836,523 $ 782,358 $ 626,720 7 % 25 %\nCost of sales 531,811 529,052 427,755 1 24\nGross profit 304,712 253,306 198,965 20 27\nGross margin % 36.4 % 32.4 % 31.7 % 4.0 pp(a) 0.7 pp(a)\nAdvertising and promotion expenses 38,213 29,714 16,098 29 85\nSG&A expenses 91,395 74,627 72,829 22 2\nImpairment of long-lived assets and other 19,391 — — N/A N/A\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration 7,100 — — N/A N/A\nInsurance recoveries — — (16,325) N/A N/A\nOperating income 148,613 148,965 126,363 — 18\nOperating margin % 17.8 % 19.0 % 20.2 % (1.2) pp (1.2) pp\nInterest expense, net (6,647) (5,451) (4,037) 22 35\nOther expense, net (220) (3,342) (1,230) (93) 172\nIncome before income taxes 141,746 140,172 121,096 1 16\nIncome tax expense 34,616 31,300 30,279 11 3\nEffective tax expense rate % 24.4 % 22.3 % 25.0 % 2.1 pp (2.7) pp\nNet income $ 107,130 $ 108,872 $ 90,817 (2)% 20 %\nNet income margin % 12.8 % 13.9 % 14.5 % (1.1) pp (0.6) pp\nBasic EPS $ 4.82 $ 4.94 $ 4.37 (2)% 13 %\nDiluted EPS $ 4.80 $ 4.92 $ 4.37 (2)% 13 %\n(a) Percentage points (“pp”).\nSales\n2023 to 2022 - Sales for 2023 were $836,523, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2022, which was the result of increased sales in the Distilling Solutions, Branded Spirits, and\nIngredient Solutions segments.

Total Branded Spirits segment sales increased 30 percent, due to an increase in sales across all price tier categories. Total Ingredient Solutions segment sales\nincreased 28 percent, primarily due to increased sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins.\nGross profit\n2023 to 2022 - Gross profit for 2023 was $304,712, an increase of 20 percent compared to 2022. The increase was driven by an increase in gross profit in the Distilling\nSolutions, Branded Spirits, and Ingredient Solutions segments.

This increase was primarily driven by increased\nadvertising and promotion investment in the Branded Spirits segment, primarily in the premium plus price tiers.\n2022 to 2021 - Advertising and promotion expenses for 2022 were $29,714, an increase of 85 percent compared to 2021. This was primarily driven by an increased advertising\nand promotion investment in the Branded Spirits segment, specifically in the premium plus price tiers. The increase was also driven by the assumption of Luxco’s advertising\nand promotion expenses for the full year of 2022.\nSG&A expenses\n2023 to 2022 - SG&A expenses for 2023 were $91,395, an increase of 22 percent compared to 2022. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher personnel\nexpenses and incentive compensation, inclusive of certain incremental costs incurred relating to our CEO transition, and business acquisition expenses related to the acquisition\nof Penelope.\n2022 to 2021 - SG&A expenses for 2022 were $74,627, an increase of 2 percent compared to 2021. The increase in SG&A was driven by the assumption of Luxco’s SG&A\nexpenses for the full year of 2022, as well as higher personnel and incentive compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in advisory and other transaction costs in 2021\nrelated to the merger with Luxco that did not recur in 2022.\nOperating income\nOperating income % Increase (Decrease)\nOperating income for 2021 $ 126,363\nIncrease in gross profit - Branded Spirits segment(a) 32,877 26 pp(b)\nIncrease in gross profit - Distilling Solutions segment(a) 12,176 10 pp\nIncrease in gross profit - Ingredient Solutions segment(a) 9,288 7 pp\nIncrease in advertising and promotion expenses (13,616) (11) pp\nIncrease in SG&A expenses (1,798) (1) pp\nDecrease in insurance recoveries (16,325) (13) pp\nOperating income for 2022 148,965 18 %\nIncrease in gross profit - Distilling Solutions segment(a) 18,682 13 pp(b)\nIncrease in gross profit - Branded Spirits segment(a) 17,260 12 pp\nIncrease in gross profit - Ingredient Solutions segment(a) 15,464 10 pp\nIncrease in advertising and promotion expenses (8,499) (6) pp\nIncrease in SG&A expenses (16,768) (11) pp\nImpairment of long-lived assets and other (19,391) (13) pp\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (7,100) (5) pp\nOperating income for 2023 $ 148,613 — %\n(a) See segment discussion.\n(b) Percentage points (“pp”).\n2023 to 2022 - Operating income for 2023 decreased to $148,613 from $148,965 for 2022, primarily due to the impairment of assets and other expenses of $19,391 related to\nthe closure of the Atchison Distillery, increased SG&A expenses and advertising and promotion expenses as discussed above, and the change in fair value of the contingent\nconsideration of $7,100 related to the Penelope acquisition. These impacts were mostly offset by increased gross profit in all three segments.\n24\n2022 to 2021 - Operating income for 2022 increased to $148,965 from $126,363 for 2021, due to increases in gross profit in the Branded Spirits, Distilling Solutions, and\nIngredient Solutions segments. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in insurance recoveries as well as increases in advertising and promotion expenses and SG&A\nexpenses.\nIncome tax expense\n2023 to 2022 - Income tax expense for 2023 was $34,616, for an effective tax rate for the year of 24.4 percent. Income tax expense for 2022 was $31,300, for an effective tax\nrate for the year of 22.3 percent. The 2.1 percentage point increase was primarily due to an increase in valuation allowances and lower tax credits.\n2022 to 2021 - Income tax expense for 2022 was $31,300, for an effective tax rate for the year of 22.3 percent. Income tax expense for 2021 was $30,279, for an effective tax\nrate for the year of 25.0 percent. The 2.7 percentage point decrease was primarily due to an increase in state tax credits due to capital expenditures investments.\nBasic and diluted EPS\nEPS % Increase (Decrease)\nBasic and Diluted EPS for 2021 $ 4.37\nChange in operating income(a) 1.12 26 pp(b)\nChange in interest expense(a) (0.06) (1) pp\nChange in other expense, net(a) (0.08) (2) pp\nChange in weighted average shares outstanding(c) (0.51) (12) pp\nChange in effective tax rate 0.10 2 pp\nBasic EPS for 2022 4.94 13 %\nImpact of dilutive shares outstanding (0.02) — pp\nDiluted EPS for 2022 $ 4.92 13 %\nEPS % Increase (Decrease)\nBasic EPS for 2022 $ 4.94\nChange in operating income(a) (0.02) — pp(b)\nChange in interest expense(a) (0.04) (1) pp\nChange in other expense, net(a) 0.11 2 pp\nChange in weighted average shares outstanding(c) (0.02) — pp\nChange in effective tax rate (0.15) (3) pp\nBasic EPS for 2023 4.82 (2)%\nImpact of dilutive shares outstanding (0.02) (1) pp\nDiluted EPS for 2023 $ 4.80 (3)%\n(a) Items are net of tax based on the effective tax rate for each base year.\n(b) Percentage points (“pp”).\n(c) Weighted average shares outstanding change primarily related to the vesting of employee restricted stock units (“RSUs”), our withholding and purchase of vested RSUs from employees to pay\nwithholding taxes, and the granting of Common Stock to directors.

Sales of brown goods within premium beverage alcohol and warehouse services\nincreased while white goods within premium beverage alcohol, distillers feed and related co-products, industrial alcohol, and fuel grade alcohol decreased compared to 2022.\nThe increase in sales of brown goods was driven by higher average selling price and higher sales volume. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of white goods,\ndistillers feed and related co-products, industrial alcohol and fuel grade alcohol, which was driven primarily by lower sales volume in connection with the Atchison Distillery\nclosure. The decreases in sales volume of white goods, distillers feed and related co-products, and industrial alcohol were partially offset by higher average selling price.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $18,682, or 15 percent. Gross margin for 2023 increased to 32.2 percent from 29.5 percent for 2022. The increase in gross profit was\ndue primarily to increased average selling price and volume of higher margin brown goods.

Sales of brown goods within premium beverage alcohol, distillers feed and\nrelated co-products, and warehouse services increased while industrial alcohol, white goods within premium beverage alcohol, and fuel grade alcohol decreased compared to\n2021. The increase in sales of brown goods was driven by higher sales volume and higher average selling price. The increase in sales of distillers feed and related co-products\nwas due to higher average selling price, partially offset by lower sales volumes, both of which primarily resulted from the previously disclosed dryer fire at our Atchison facility\nwhich occurred in 2020. Our warehouse services sales increased due to the increase in storage of our customer owned barreled whiskey and related warehouse services that we\nprovide. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of industrial alcohol and white goods, which were driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by higher\naverage selling price.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $12,176, or 11 percent. Gross margin for 2022 decreased to 29.5 percent from 32.4 percent for 2021. The increase in gross profit was\ndue primarily to higher average selling price and higher sales volume on brown goods. These increases were partially offset by lower gross profit in industrial alcohol, white\ngoods, and fuel grade alcohol, all of which were driven by higher input costs. The average selling price for these products also increased, but not enough to offset the higher\ninput costs which caused a decrease in the gross margin percentage.\n27\nBRANDED SPIRITS SEGMENT\nBRANDED SPIRITS SALES\nYear-versus-Year Sales Change Increase/\nYear Ended December 31, (Decrease)\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nUltra Premium $ 63,748 $ 48,245 $ 15,503 32 %\nSuper Premium 13,424 12,274 1,150 9\nPremium 28,293 24,211 4,082 17\nPremium Plus 105,465 84,730 20,735 24\nMid 75,676 82,530 (6,854) (8)\nValue 47,907 47,395 512 1\nOther 24,885 23,284 1,601 7\nTotal Branded Spirits $ 253,933 $ 237,939 $ 15,994 7 %\nChange in Year-versus-Year Sales Attributed to:\nTotal(a) Volume(b) Net Price/Mix(c)\nBranded Spirits 7% (6)% 13%\nOther Financial Information\nYear Ended December 31, Year-versus-Year Increase/(Decrease)\n2023 2022 Change % Change\nGross profit $ 112,781 $ 95,521 $ 17,260 18 %\nGross margin % 44.4 % 40.1 % 4.3 pp(d)\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Volume change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales volume and prior period sales volume, multiplied by prior period sales per unit.

Sales of brands within the premium plus price tiers as well as sales within the other\ncategory and the value price tier increased while sales of brands within the mid price tier decreased. The increase in sales of brands within the premium plus price tiers was\nprimarily due to the acquisition of Penelope, an increase in average selling price, and an increase in sales volume. Sales within the value and other categories increased primarily\ndue to an increase in average selling price. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of brands within the mid price tier, primarily due to decreased sales volume\nas a result of sales shifting to higher margin accretive brands within the premium plus price tiers, partially offset by an increase in average selling price within the mid price tier.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $17,260, or 18 percent. Gross margin for 2023 increased to 44.4 percent compared to 40.1 percent for 2022. The increase in gross\nprofit was primarily driven by contributions from the acquisition of Penelope as well as by higher average selling price in the premium plus price tiers, value, mid, and other\nprice tiers.

Sales across all pricing tiers increased compared to 2021, primarily due to the\nadditional brands acquired as part of the Merger that occurred on April 1, 2021. Additionally, sales increased in the premium plus price tiers due primarily to increased sales of\nAmerican whiskey brands.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $32,877, or 52 percent. Gross margin for 2022 increased to 40.1 percent compared to 34.1 percent for 2021. The increase in gross\nprofit was primarily driven by volume associated with the additional brands acquired as part of the Merger, increased average net price and mix as well as a required step up in\nvalue of certain assets due to purchase accounting related to the Merger in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. Of the purchase accounting step ups, $2,529 was associated with\nmarking the finished goods inventory to fair value and fully flowed through in the prior year period.

We have incurred $61,108, $47,859, and $51,691 of capital expenditures and have paid\n$55,267, $45,323, and $47,389 for capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The difference between the amount of capital\nexpenditures incurred and amount paid is due to the change in capital expenditures in accounts payable. We expect approximately $85,800 in capital expenditures for 2024,\nwhich we expect to use for facility improvement and expansion, facility sustenance projects, and environmental health and safety projects.\n32\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $45,924, primarily due to net proceeds on long-term debt of $57,400\n(see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt), partially offset by payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $10,675 (see Note 9, Equity and EPS for additional information).\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $14,764, primarily due to payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $10,646 (see Note 9,\nEquity and EPS for additional information), and principal payments on long-term debt of $3,403 (see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt).\nTreasury Purchases. 22,592 RSUs vested and converted to common shares during the year ended December 31, 2023, of which we withheld and purchased for treasury 8,437\nshares valued at $801 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes.\n29,376 RSUs vested and converted to common shares during the year ended December 31, 2022, of which we withheld and purchased for treasury 9,031 shares valued at $715\nto cover payment of associated withholding taxes.\nLong-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements\nfor ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including brand development and Board-approved dividends) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $287,249\n(net of unamortized loan fees of $6,601) at December 31, 2023 and $230,335 (net of unamortized loan fees of $6,115) at December 31, 2022. Net borrowings / (payments) on\nall debt for 2023 and 2022 were $57,400, and $(3,403), respectively (see Note 7, Corporate Borrowings for additional information).\nDividends and Dividend Equivalents. See Note 9, Equity and EPS for further discussion.\nOn February 22, 2024, we announced a dividend payable to stockholders of record of our Common Stock, resulting in dividend equivalents payable to RSU holders, of $0.12\nper share and per RSU. The dividend and dividend equivalent are payable on March 29, 2024 to stockholders of record and RSU holders on March 15, 2024.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nOur principal uses of cash in the ordinary course of business are for input costs used in our production processes, salaries, capital expenditures, and investments supporting our\nstrategic plan, such as the aging of barreled distillate and potential mergers and acquisitions. Generally, during periods when commodities prices are rising, our operations\nrequire increased use of cash to support inventory levels.\nOur principal sources of cash are product sales and borrowings on our various debt agreements. Under these agreements, we must meet certain financial covenants and\nrestrictions, and at December 31, 2023, we met those covenants and restrictions.\nAt December 31, 2023, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by $400,191, largely due to our inventories, at cost, of $346,853. At December 31, 2023, our cash\nbalance was $18,388, and we have used our various debt agreements for liquidity purposes, with $337,000 available under our Credit Agreement for additional borrowings and\n$220,400 available under the Note Purchase Agreement (see Note 7, Corporate Borrowings for additional information). We anticipate being able to support our short-term\nliquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We regularly assess our cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. We utilize\nshort-term and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as capital investments, dividend payments as well as potential mergers and acquisitions. Subject to market\nconditions, we could also fund future mergers and acquisitions through the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock. In addition, we have strong operating results such\nthat we believe financial institutions should provide sufficient credit funding to meet our short-term financing requirements, if needed.\n33\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information on the amounts and payments of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2023:\nPayments due by period\nTotal Short-Term (a) Long-Term\nLong-term debt $ 293,850 $ 6,400 $ 287,450\nInterest on long-term debt (c) 71,677 4,841 66,836\nOperating leases 16,092 3,702 12,390\nPurchase commitments 126,893 115,011 (b) 11,882\nOther 863 205 658\nTotal $ 509,375 $ 130,159 $ 379,216\n(a) Short-term obligation payments are due within 12 months from the current year end.\n(b) Includes open purchase order commitments related to raw materials and packaging used in the ordinary course of business of 101,872.\n(c) Excludes variable interest on long-term debt\nIndustrial Revenue Bonds\nWe are in the process of completing several projects that have been financed using industrial revenue bonds in the state of Kentucky. Traditionally, industrial revenue bonds\nhave been used as an economic development tool in the state to attract desirable businesses, including business in the bourbon industry, and have allowed a 15 to 40 year real\nproperty tax abatement on our renovated and newly-constructed warehouse buildings and distilleries in Kentucky. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $50,000 of our\nfacilities in Nelson County, Kentucky and approximately $30,900 of our facilities in Williamstown, Kentucky were financed with industrial revenue bonds. The city then leased\nthe facilities back to us under a capital lease, the terms of which provide for the payment of basic rent in an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds. Our\nobligation to pay rent under the lease is in the same amount and due on the same date as the obligation to pay debt service on the bonds which we hold. The lease permits us to\npresent the bonds at any time for cancellation, upon which our obligation to pay basic rent would be canceled. At the bonds’ maturity, the facilities will revert to us without\ncosts. If we were to present the bonds for cancellation prior to maturity, a nominal fee could be incurred. We may not be able to use industrial revenue bonds in the future due to\nlegislative, regulatory, and related changes in the state of Kentucky.\nWe recorded the land and buildings as assets in property, plant, and equipment, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Because we own all outstanding bonds, have a legal\nright to set-off, and intend to set-off the corresponding lease and interest payments, we have netted the capital lease obligation with the bond asset. No amount for our\nobligation under the capital lease is reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor do we reflect an amount for the corresponding industrial revenue bond asset (see Note\n11, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information).\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. The application of certain of these policies places demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on\nestimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop as forecast, and estimates\nroutinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. We have identified the most critical accounting policies which involve the most complex and subjective\njudgments. These should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.\nBusiness Combinations. The acquisition of Penelope was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting\nStandard Codification 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), and as such, we allocated the consideration paid for the business to the estimated fair value of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill. The fair value measurements of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities\nwere based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Critical estimates used in determining the fair value include, but are not limited to discount rates that would be\nused by a market participant in valuing these assets and liabilities, projections of revenues and cash flows, distributor attrition rates, royalty rates, and market comparables,\namong others. The fair value of work-in process and finished goods inventory was determined using the comparative sales method and raw materials was determined using the\nreplacement cost method. The trade names and\n34\ndistributor relationships acquired were recorded at fair value using the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method, respectively. Management\nengaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the valuation analysis of certain acquired assets including trade name and distributor relationship.\nContingent Consideration. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the Acquisition date was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation\napproach. This approach requires significant assumptions, including projected net sales, discount rates, and volatility rates. The contingent consideration liability is measured\non a quarterly basis and recorded at fair value. The changes in fair value of the obligation result from changes in the key assumptions between measurement dates, such as\nprojected net sales, discount rates, and volatility rates. The adjustment to fair value is recorded in the change in fair value of contingent consideration line on the Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or on an\ninterim basis if events and circumstances occur that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value. We have the\noption to evaluate qualitative factors to assess if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired before quantifying the fair value of the reporting unit.\nManagement judgment is required in the evaluation of qualitative factors, determination of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, including\ngoodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To the extent that the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized and\nallocated to the reporting units. Based on the impairment tests performed by the Company during the fourth quarter 2023, we believe none of our goodwill or indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are impaired and are not currently at risk of impairment.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1, Nature of\nOperations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk\nmanagement program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our\noperating results.\nCommodity Costs. Certain commodities we use in our production process, or input costs, expose us to market price risk due to volatility in the prices for those commodities.\nThrough our grain supply contracts for our Lawrenceburg facility, our wheat flour supply contract for our Atchison facility, and our natural gas contracts for both facilities, we\npurchase grain, wheat flour, and natural gas, respectively, for delivery from one to 24 months into the future at negotiated prices. We have determined that the firm\ncommitments to purchase grain, wheat flour, and natural gas under the terms of our supply contracts meet the normal purchases and sales exception as defined under\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, because the quantities involved are for amounts to be consumed within the normal expected\nproduction process.\nInterest Rate Exposures. Our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement (Note 7, Corporate Borrowings) expose us to market risks arising\nfrom adverse changes in interest rates. Established procedures and internal processes govern the management of this market risk.\nIncreases in market interest rates would cause interest expense to increase and earnings before income taxes to decrease. The change in interest expense and earnings before\nincome taxes would be dependent upon the weighted average outstanding borrowings during the reporting period following an increase in market interest rates. Based on\nweighted average outstanding variable-rate borrowings at December 31, 2023, a 100 basis point increase over the current rates actually in effect at such date would increase our\ninterest expense on an annual basis by $630. Based on weighted average outstanding fixed-rate borrowings at December 31, 2023, a 100 basis point increase in market rates\nwould result in a decrease in the fair value of our outstanding fixed-rate debt of $17,134, and a 100 basis point decrease in market rates would result in an increase in the fair\nvalue of our outstanding fixed-rate debt of $13,000.\n35\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our\nreceipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and\noperated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nand procedures may deteriorate.\nWith the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the\nTreadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 was\neffective.\nKPMG, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s financial statements contained herein, has issued an audit report on our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n36\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors\nMGP Ingredients, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGP Ingredients, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,\n2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based\non criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment\nof the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on\nour audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control\nbased on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\n37\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nRevenue recognition under bill and hold arrangements\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s Distilling Solutions segment routinely enters into bill and hold arrangements, whereby the\nCompany produces and sells aged and unaged distillate to customers. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, brown goods premium beverage alcohol\nrevenue was $289,191 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023, a portion of which was for bill and hold arrangements.\nWe identified the evaluation of revenue recognized under bill and hold arrangements as a critical audit matter because of the extent of additional audit effort required to test the\nincremental bill and hold revenue recognition criteria. The incremental bill and hold revenue recognition criteria include the evaluation of: 1) the reason for the bill and hold\narrangement; 2) the identification of the product as separately belonging to the customer; 3) the product being currently ready for physical transfer to the customer; and 4) the\nCompany’s inability to use the product or direct it to another customer.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal\ncontrols over the Company’s revenue recognition process, including controls related to bill and hold revenue recognition criteria being met. We examined a sample of bill and\nhold revenue transactions to assess the incremental bill and hold revenue recognition criteria. Specifically, we inspected documentation received from the customer directing\nthe Company to warehouse distillate after production. Additionally, we observed a sample of customer-owned barrels to determine they were marked with unique identifiers\nseparating them from Company-owned inventory and were ready for physical transfer to the customer upon request. Also, to evaluate that the Company does not have the\nability to use the product or direct to another customer, we inspected underlying documentation for the same sample of bill and hold transactions to determine legal title to the\nproduct had transferred to the customer.\nAcquisition-date fair value measurement of contingent consideration liability\nAs discussed in Note 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on June 1, 2023, the Company acquired Penelope Bourbon LLC (Penelope) in a business combination\nfor cash consideration of $104,638 thousand and contingent consideration of up to $110,800 thousand if the Penelope business achieves certain net sales targets between the\nacquisition date and December 31, 2025. At the acquisition date, management estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration liability to be $62,100 thousand using a\nMonte Carlo simulation based on certain assumptions including projected net sales over the term of the earn-out period and volatility rate.\nWe identified the assessment of the acquisition-date fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective\nauditor judgment was required to evaluate the projected net sales and volatility rate used in the Monte Carlo simulation. Changes in these assumptions could have had a\nsignificant impact on the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal\ncontrols over the Company’s acquisition-date valuation of the contingent consideration liability, including controls related to the determination of projected net sales and\nvolatility rate.\n38\nWe performed sensitivity analyses over the projected net sales and volatility rate to assess the impact of changes in those assumptions on the Company’s determination of the\nacquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration liability. We assessed the projected net sales by comparing them to Penelope’s historical actual results, actual results\nsince the acquisition, and industry data. We also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted us in evaluating the volatility rate used\nin the Monte Carlo simulation model by comparing it to comparable companies.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\nKansas City, Missouri\nFebruary 22, 2024\n39\nMGP INGREDIENTS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n44\nMGP INGREDIENTS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted)\nNOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company. MGP Ingredients, Inc. (“MGP,” or the “Company”) is a leading producer and supplier of premium distilled spirits, branded spirits, and food ingredients.\nDistilled spirits include premium bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys and grain neutral spirits (“GNS”), including vodka and gin. The Company’s distilled spirits are either sold\ndirectly or indirectly to manufacturers of other branded spirits. MGP was also a producer of high quality industrial alcohol for use in both food and non-food applications, which\nwas primarily produced at the Company’s distillery located in Atchison, Kansas, prior to its closure during December 2023. The Company has a portfolio of its own high\nquality branded spirits which are produced through the distilleries and bottling facilities and sold to distributors. The Company’s branded spirits products account for a range of\nprice points from value products through ultra premium brands. The Company’s protein and starch food ingredients provide a host of functional, nutritional, and sensory\nbenefits for a wide range of food products to serve the consumer packaged goods industry. The ingredients products are sold directly, or through distributors, to manufacturers\nand processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries.\nOn June 1, 2023, the Company acquired Penelope Bourbon LLC (“Penelope”), which, prior to the Company’s acquisition, was a family and founder-owned and operated\nAmerican whiskey company with a diverse portfolio of high-quality whiskeys in the premium plus price tiers. See Note 4, Business Combination, for further details.\nThe Company reports three operating segments: Distilling Solutions, Branded Spirits, and Ingredient Solutions.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All\nsignificant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in the 2021 and 2022 consolidated financial statements have been\nreclassified to conform to the 2023 presentation.\nUse of Estimates. The financial reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The\npreparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\nthe disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The\napplication of certain of these policies places demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events may not develop as forecast, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require\nmaterial adjustment.\nInventory. Inventory includes finished goods, raw materials in the form of agricultural commodities used in the production process, as well as bottles, caps, and labels used in\nthe bottling process, and certain maintenance and repair items. Bourbons, ryes, and other whiskeys, included in inventory, are normally aged in barrels for several years,\nfollowing industry practice; all barreled bourbon, rye, and other whiskeys are classified as a current asset. The Company includes warehousing, insurance, and other carrying\ncharges applicable to barreled whiskey in inventory costs.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, method. Inventory valuations are impacted by constantly changing prices\npaid for key materials, primarily corn.\nProperties, Depreciation, and Amortization. Property, plant, and equipment are typically stated at cost. Additions, including those that increase the life or utility of an asset,\nare capitalized and all properties are depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over\nthe following estimated useful lives:\nBuildings and improvements(a) 10 – 35 years\nMachinery and equipment 3 – 10 years\nOffice furniture and equipment 5 – 10 years\nComputer equipment and software 3 – 5 years\nMotor vehicles 5 years\n(a) Leasehold improvements are the shorter of economic useful life or life of the lease\n45\nMaintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The cost of property, plant, and equipment sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, as well as related accumulated depreciation and\namortization, are eliminated from the property accounts with related gains and losses reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company capitalizes interest\ncosts associated with significant construction projects. Total interest incurred for 2023, 2022, and 2021 is noted below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nInterest costs charged to expense $ 6,647 $ 5,451 $ 4,037\nPlus: Interest cost capitalized 2,349 866 339\nTotal $ 8,996 $ 6,317 $ 4,376\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services, through performance obligations by the Company, is transferred to the customer\nin an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the performance obligations. The term between invoicing and when\npayment is due is not significant and the period between when the entity transfers the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or\nservice is generally one year or less.\nRevenue is recognized for the sale of products at the point in time finished products are delivered to the customer in accordance with shipping terms. This is a faithful depiction\nof the satisfaction of the performance obligation because, at that point control passes to the customer, the customer has legal title and the risk and rewards of ownership have\ntransferred, and the customer has a present obligation to pay.\nThe Distilling Solutions segment routinely enters into bill and hold arrangements, whereby the Company produces and sells aged and unaged distillate to customers, and the\nproduct is barreled at the customer’s request and warehoused at a Company location for an extended period of time in accordance with directions received from the Company’s\ncustomers. Even though the aged and unaged distillate remains in the Company’s possession, a sale is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the\nproduct. Control is transferred to the customer in bill and hold transactions when customer acceptance specifications have been met, legal title has transferred, the customer has\na present obligation to pay for the product and the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Additionally, all the following bill and hold criteria have been\nmet in order for control to be transferred to the customer: the reason for the bill and hold arrangement is substantive, the customer has requested the product be warehoused, the\nproduct has been identified as separately belonging to the customer, the product is currently ready for physical transfer to the customer, and the Company does not have the\nability to use the product or direct it to another customer.\nWarehouse service revenue is recognized over the time that warehouse services are rendered and as they are rendered. This is a faithful depiction of the satisfaction of the\nperformance obligation because control of the aging products has already passed to the customer and there are no additional performance activities required by the Company,\nexcept as requested by the customer. The performance of the service activities, as requested, is invoiced as satisfied and revenue is concurrently recognized. Contract bottling is\nrecognized over the time contract bottling services are rendered and as they are rendered.\nSales in the Branded Spirits segment reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in incentive programs, including discounts and allowances for certain\nvolume targets. These allowances and discounts are not for distinct goods and are paid only when the depletion volume targets are achieved by the customer. The amounts\nreimbursed to customers are determined based on agreed-upon amounts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nExcise Taxes. The Company is responsible for compliance with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau\nof the U.S. Treasury Department (the “TTB”) regulations which includes making timely and accurate excise tax payments. The Company is subject to periodic compliance\naudits by the TTB. Individual U.S. states also impose excise taxes on alcohol beverages in varying amounts. The Company calculates its U.S. federal and state excise tax\nexpense based upon units shipped and on its understanding of the applicable excise tax laws. Excise taxes that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-\nproducing transaction, and that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue and expense.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset\ngroup may not be fully recoverable. The Company determines the carrying amount of the asset group using the future projected cash flows as well as quantitative and\nqualitative factors. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset group. For the year ended December\n46\n31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment of long-lived assets and other of $19,391. See Note 6, Closure of the Atchison Distillery, for more information.\nRecognition of Insurance Recoveries. Estimated loss contingencies are recognized as charges to income when they are probable and reasonably estimable. Insurance\nrecoveries are not recognized until all contingencies related to the insurance claim have been resolved and settlement has been reached with the insurer. Insurance recoveries, to\nthe extent of costs and losses, are reported as a reduction to costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Insurance recoveries, in excess of costs and losses, if any, would be\nreported as a separate caption in operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring November 2020, the Company experienced a fire at the Atchison facility. The fire damaged certain equipment in the facility’s feed drying operations and caused\ntemporary loss of production time. At December 31, 2021, the Company received a legally binding commitment from its insurance carrier for final settlement of $43,688,\n$27,363 related to business interruption and $16,325 for the damaged dryer. The Company recorded a settlement related to business interruption from its insurance carrier of\n$23,583 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The business interruption portion of the settlement was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements\nof Income and the insurance recoveries for the replacement of the damaged dryer was recorded as insurance recoveries on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The\nCompany finalized the construction of the replacement drying system and placed this dryer into service during 2021.\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation\nallowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that at least some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nEarnings Per Common Share (“EPS”). Basic and diluted EPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines net income\nper share for each class of Common Stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Basic EPS amounts are\ncomputed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is computed using the if-\nconverted method by dividing the net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding, inclusive of the impact of the Convertible Senior\nNotes, except for where the result would be anti-dilutive as of the balance sheet date.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies. Assets and liabilities of Niche Drinks, Co., Ltd. (“Niche”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company whose functional currency is the\nBritish pound sterling, are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using average\nrates during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation process are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company maintains a\nU.S. bank account denominated in British pounds sterling and it is adjusted for the market exchange rate at the reporting period-end. Any impacts of the adjustment for the\nexchange rate applied to the financial asset is reported in other expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nBusiness Combinations. Assets and liabilities assumed during a business combination are generally recorded at fair market value as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is\nrecognized to the extent that the purchase consideration, including contingent consideration, exceeds the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company uses\nits internal estimates and third-party valuation specialists to assist in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period,\nwhich can be up to one year after the acquisition date, the Company can make adjustments to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the offset being\nan adjustment to goodwill.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company records goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in connection with various acquisitions of businesses and\nallocates the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to its respective reporting units. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the\nfourth quarter, or on an interim basis if events and circumstances occur that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the\ncarrying value. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized. Judgment is required in the determination of reporting units,\nthe assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. The Company separately evaluates\nindefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. As of December 31, 2023, the Company determined that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.\n47\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The Company determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based upon the\nobservability of inputs. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the\nability to access. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or\nliability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain\ncases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment\nof the significance of a particular input to the fair value in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\nThe Company’s short-term financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The carrying value of the short-term financial\ninstruments approximates the fair value due to their short-term nature. These financial instruments have no stated maturities or the financial instruments have short-term\nmaturities that approximate market.\nThe fair value of the Company’s debt is estimated based on current market interest rates for debt with similar maturities and credit quality .Excluding the impact of the\nconversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes, the fair value of the Company’s debt was $194,440 and $150,249 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nfinancial statement carrying value (net of unamortized loan fees) was $287,249 and $230,335 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These fair values are considered\nLevel 2 under the fair value hierarchy.\nThe fair value calculation of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Penelope uses unobservable inputs, such as estimated net sales over the term of the earn-\nout period, discount rates, and volatility rates. The contingent consideration is measured using the Monte Carlo simulation approach. The inputs used in the calculation of the\ncontingent consideration liability are considered Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy due to the lack of relevant market activity. See Note 4, Business Combination, for more\ninformation.\nFair value disclosure for deferred compensation plan investments is included in Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans.\nDerivative Instruments. Certain commodities the Company uses in its production process, or input costs, expose it to market price risk due to volatility in the prices for those\ncommodities. Through the Company’s grain supply contracts, its wheat flour supply contract, and its natural gas contracts, it purchases grain, wheat flour, and natural gas,\nrespectively, for delivery from one to 24 months into the future at negotiated fixed prices. The Company has determined that the firm commitments to purchase grain, wheat\nflour, and natural gas under the terms of its supply contracts meet the normal purchases and sales exception as defined under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, because the\nquantities involved are for amounts to be consumed within the normal expected production process.\nEquity Method Investments. The Company holds 50 percent interest in DGL Destiladores, S.de R.L. de C.V. (“DGL”) and Agricola LG, S.de R.L. de C.V. (“Agricola” and\ntogether with DGL, “LMX”), which are accounted for as equity method investments. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the investment in LMX was $5,197 and $5,534,\nrespectively, which is recorded in investment in joint ventures on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\nrecorded a $337 and $2,220 loss from equity method investments, respectively, which is recorded in other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standard Updates. The Company did not adopt any new Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires improved disclosures related to significant\nsegment expenses. This ASU requires companies to disclose significant segment expenses provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), a description of other\nsegment items and all existing annual disclosures must be provided on an interim basis. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. Early\nadoption is permitted and must be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to the\nCompany’s financial statements.\nASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, requires improved disclosures related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU requires companies\nto reconcile the income tax expense attributable to continuing operations to the statutory federal income tax rate applied to pre-tax income from continuing operations.\nAdditionally, this ASU requires\n48\ncompanies to disclose the total amount of income taxes paid during the period. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption\npermitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The\nCompany is currently evaluating the impact to the Company’s financial statements.\nThe other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNOTE 2: OTHER BALANCE SHEET CAPTIONS\nInventory.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nFinished goods $ 55,463 $ 47,073\nBarreled distillate (bourbons and other whiskeys) 250,183 199,040\nRaw materials 28,825 29,931\nWork in process 1,691 1,645\nMaintenance materials 8,355 9,931\nOther 2,336 2,102\nTotal $ 346,853 $ 289,722\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nLand, buildings, and improvements $ 188,521 $ 155,385\nTransportation equipment 844 805\nMachinery and equipment 261,354 257,075\nConstruction in progress 38,927 37,535\nProperty, plant, and equipment, at cost 489,646 450,800\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization (227,343) (215,168)\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net $ 262,303 $ 235,632\nAccrued expenses and other.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nEmployee benefit plans $ 5,140 $ 2,389\nSalaries and wages 16,637 17,862\nProperty taxes 2,062 1,318\nCurrent operating lease liabilities 3,318 3,807\nOther 4,704 3,340\nTotal $ 31,861 $ 28,716\nNOTE 3: REVENUE\nThe Company generates revenue from the Distilling Solutions segment by the sale of products and by providing warehouse services related to the storage and aging of customer\nproducts.

On May 8, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire1 00 percent of the equity of Penelope, and subsequently\ncompleted the acquisition on June 1, 2023 (the “Acquisition”). Penelope, prior to the Acquisition, was a family and founder-owned and operated American whiskey company\nwith a diverse portfolio of high-quality whiskeys in the premium plus price tiers. As a result of the Acquisition, the Company enhanced its presence in the growing American\nwhiskey category and expanded its portfolio of premium plus price tier brands.\nFollowing the Acquisition, Penelope became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and its financial results are included within the Branded Spirits segment.

The consideration is subject to customary\npurchase price adjustments related to, among other things, net working capital and acquired cash. The consideration paid at closing included a preliminary estimated purchase\nprice adjustment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the\n50\nCompany finalized the net working capital adjustments, which decreased the cash consideration from $105,000 at closing to $104,638 at December 31, 2023. The cash portion\nof the consideration and transaction-related expenses were paid using both cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s existing credit agreement. See Note 7, Corporate\nBorrowings, for further details.\nFor tax purposes, the Acquisition was structured as an asset purchase which created additional tax basis in the assets acquired as a result of valuing the assets at fair market value\nand the purchase price will be accounted for in accordance with U.S. federal tax law. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is expected to be deductible for U.S. income\ntax purposes.\nPurchase Price Allocation. The Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with FASB Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business\nCombinations (“ASC 805”), and as such, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration transferred were recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the consideration paid for Penelope to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition\ndate, with the excess recorded to goodwill.\nConsideration:\nCash $ 104,638\nContingent consideration 62,100\nFair value of total consideration transferred $ 166,738\nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nCash $ 926\nReceivables 2,323\nInventory 12,454\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 77\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 253\nIntangible assets (a) 57,700\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 426\nOther assets 44\nTotal assets 74,203\nAccounts payable 2,242\nAccrued expenses and other 205\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 268\nTotal liabilities 2,715\nGoodwill 95,250\nTotal $ 166,738\n(a) Intangible assets acquired included trade names with an estimated fair value of $34,000 and distributor relationships with an estimated fair value of $23,700.\nIn accordance with ASC 805, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration transferred were recorded at their estimated fair values on the Acquisition date. The fair\nvalue measurements of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and represent Level 3 measurements within\nthe fair value hierarchy. Level 3 inputs include discount rates that would be used by a market participant in valuing these assets and liabilities, projections of revenues and cash\nflows, distributor attrition rates, royalty rates, and market comparables, among others. The fair value of work-in-process and finished goods inventory was determined using the\ncomparative sales method and raw materials was determined using the replacement cost method.\nGoodwill of $95,250, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets\nacquired net of liabilities assumed. Additionally, the goodwill is representative of the strength of the Penelope brand within the American whiskey category, and the synergies\nexpected to be achieved by the combined company. The intangible assets acquired included indefinite-lived intangible assets, trade names, which have an estimated fair value of\n$34,000, and definite-lived intangible assets, distributor relationships, which have an estimated fair value of $23,700 and a useful life of 20 years. The trade names and\ndistributor relationships acquired by the Company have been recorded at estimated fair values using the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method,\nrespectively. Management engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the valuation analysis of certain acquired assets including trade names and distributor\nrelationships.\n51\nThe operating results of Penelope have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of the Acquisition, June 1, 2023. The operating results\nand pro forma results are not disclosed due to the immaterial impact to the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $2,060 of costs related to the Acquisition, which are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses\non the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nContingent Consideration. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the Acquisition date was $62,100, which was determined using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation approach. This approach requires significant assumptions, including projected net sales, discount rates, and volatility rates. The inputs used in the calculation of the\ncontingent consideration liability are considered Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy due to the lack of relevant market activity. The contingent consideration liability is\nmeasured on a quarterly basis and recorded at fair value. The changes in fair value of the obligation resulted from changes in the key assumptions between measurement dates,\nsuch as projected net sales, discount rates, and volatility rates. During the year ended December 31, 2023, there was a $7,100 adjustment to the fair value measurement of the\ncontingent consideration obligation, which was included in the change in fair value of contingent consideration on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amount payable\nis based upon achievement of certain net sales targets between the Acquisition date and December 31, 2025. The possible payments range from zero to a maximum payout of\n$110,800.\nMerger with Luxco\nDescription of the transaction. On January 22, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Luxco, Inc. (“Luxco”) and subsequently completed the\nmerger on April 1, 2021 (the “Merger”). Luxco is a leading branded beverage alcohol company across various categories, with a more than 60-year business heritage. As a\nresult of the Merger, MGP increased its scale and market position in the branded-spirits sector and believes it strengthened its platform for future growth of higher valued-added\nproducts.\nFollowing the Merger, Luxco became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGP and is included within the Branded Spirits segment. The aggregate consideration paid by the\nCompany in connection with the Merger was $237,500 in cash (less assumed indebtedness) and 5,007,833 shares of Common Stock of the Company, subject to adjustment for\nfractional shares (the “Company Shares,” and together with the cash portion, the “Merger Consideration”). The Company Shares were valued at $296,213 and represented\napproximately 22.8 percent of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock immediately following the closing of the Merger. The Merger Consideration was subject to\ncustomary purchase price adjustments related to, among other things, net working capital, acquired cash and assumed debt. The consideration paid at closing included a\npreliminary estimated purchase price adjustment. In September 2021, the parties finalized the purchase price adjustment, which decreased the cash consideration paid by\napproximately $608 and increased stock consideration by an additional 1,373 shares from the preliminary amounts that were paid at closing.\nThe cash portion of the Merger Consideration, the repayment of assumed debt, and transaction-related expenses were financed with borrowings under the Company’s existing\nCredit Agreement which was drawn down on April 1, 2021.\nFor tax purposes, the transaction was structured partially as a tax-free reorganization and partially as a taxable acquisition, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The\nCompany anticipates the amount transferred in a tax deferred manner, under the tax-free reorganization rules, will not create additional tax basis for the Company. The taxable\ncomponent of the transaction will create additional tax basis and a corresponding future tax deduction for the Company.\nOperating Results. The operating results of Luxco were consolidated with the Company’s operating results subsequent to the merger date. During the year ended December 31,\n2021, the Company recorded $177,607 and $17,027, of sales and income before income taxes, respectively, attributable to Luxco on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred $8,927 of transaction related costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\n52\nPro Forma Information.

Merger\nrelated costs incurred by the Company of $8,927 for the year ended December 31, 2021 were excluded. Merger related costs incurred by Luxco of $3,132 were excluded from\nthe year ended December 31, 2021 pro forma results. A non-recurring expense of $2,529 for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the fair value adjustment of finished\ngoods inventory estimated to have been sold was removed and included in the results for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other acquired tangible and intangible assets are\nassumed to be recorded at estimated fair value on January 1, 2020 and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nThe summary pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only, is based on estimates and assumptions, and does not purport to represent what the Company’s\nconsolidated results of operations actually would have been if the Merger had occurred at an earlier date, and such data does not purport to project the Company’s results of\noperations for any future period. The basic shares outstanding used to calculate the pro forma net income per share amounts presented above have been adjusted to assume\nshares issued at the closing of the Merger were outstanding since January 1, 2020.\nNOTE 5: GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. The Company acquired definite-lived intangible asset in connection with various acquisitions of businesses.

The Atchison Distillery ceased operations in December 2023. The decision to close the Atchison Distillery is consistent with the Company’s plan to address\nprofitability headwinds associated with its GNS and industrial alcohol products within the Distilling Solutions segment. As a result of the decision to close the Atchison\nDistillery, the Company, with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, completed a fair value analysis of the assets associated with the Atchison Distillery during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.

During 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company’s activity\nin accrued interest and penalties was not significant.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) for 2023, 2022, and 2021:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBeginning of year balance $ 156 $ 113 $ 112\nAdditions based on prior year tax positions 83 75 —\nAdditions based on current year tax positions 245 2 31\nReduction for prior year tax positions (60) (34) (30)\nEnd of year balance $ 424 $ 156 $ 113\nFor each period presented, substantially all of the amount of unrecognized benefits (excluding interest and penalties) would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The\nCompany reasonably expects that the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will not change significantly over the next 12 months.\nThe Company is not under any U.S. federal, state or foreign income tax audits. For U.S. federal tax purpose, all tax years after 2019 remain open to examination. Amounts paid\nfor income tax in foreign jurisdictions are not material to the financial statements. In addition, the Company is subject to examination for its state tax returns for years 2019, and\nforward, with the exception of certain net operating losses and credit carryforwards originating in years prior to 2019 that remain subject to adjustment.\nNOTE 9: EQUITY AND EPS\nCapital Stock.

The Company has no finance leases. Leases with terms of twelve months or less are not recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company\nrecognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease components are accounted for separately from non-lease components, such as\ncommon-area maintenance, based on the relative, observable stand-alone prices of the components.\nThe Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than one year to ten years, some of which may include options to extend the lease. Options to renew the Company’s\nleases were not considered when assessing the value of the right-of-use assets because the Company is not reasonably certain that it will assert the options to renew the leases.\nAs most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at\ncommencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\n60\nThe following table provides supplemental balance sheet classification information related to leases:\nDecember 31,\nLeases Balance Sheet Classification 2023 2022\nAssets\nOperating Operating lease right-of-use-assets, net $ 13,975 $ 15,042\nTotal leased assets $ 13,975 $ 15,042\nLiabilities\nCurrent Operating Accrued expenses $ 3,318 $ 3,807\nNoncurrent Operating Long-term operating lease liabilities 11,292 11,622\nTotal operating lease liability $ 14,610 $ 15,429\nThe following table presents the components of lease costs:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating lease costs $ 4,364 $ 4,278\nShort-term lease costs 446 415\nNet lease costs(a) $ 4,810 $ 4,693\n(a) Recorded as a component of operating income on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow and non-cash activity related to lease information:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 4,116 $ 4,082\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations\nOperating leases $ 4,100 $ 3,417\nThe following table presents weighted average discount rate and remaining lease term:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.95 % 2.03 %\nWeighted average remaining lease term\nOperating leases 5.1 years 4.6 years\n61\nAs of December 31, 2023, the future payments under operating leases having initial terms of one year or more were as follows:\n2024 $ 3,702\n2025 3,638\n2026 3,032\n2027 2,094\n2028 1,463\nThereafter 2,163\nTotal lease payments 16,092\nLess interest (1,482)\nTotal operating lease liability $ 14,610\nNOTE 11: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments. The Company is in the process of completing several projects that have been financed using industrial revenue bonds in the state of Kentucky. Traditionally,\nindustrial revenue bonds have been used as an economic development tool in the state to attract desirable businesses, including business in the bourbon industry, and have\nallowed a 15 to 40 year real property tax abatement on the Company’s renovated and newly-constructed warehouse buildings and distilleries in Kentucky. As of December 31,\n2023, approximately $50,000 of the Company’s facilities in Nelson County Kentucky and approximately $30,900 of the Company’s facilities in Williamstown Kentucky were\nfinanced with industrial revenue bonds. The city then leased the facilities back to the Company under a capital lease, the terms of which provide for the payment of basic rent in\nan amount sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds. The Company’s obligation to pay rent under the lease is in the same amount and due on the same date as the\nobligation to pay debt service on the bonds which the Company holds. The lease permits the Company to present the bonds at any time for cancellation, upon which our\nobligation to pay basic rent would be canceled. At the bonds’ maturity the facilities will revert to the Company without costs. If the Company were to present the bonds for\ncancellation prior to maturity, a nominal fee could be incurred. The Company may not be able to use industrial revenue bonds in the future due to legislative, regulatory, and\nrelated changes in the state of Kentucky.\nThe Company recorded the land and building assets as property, plant, and equipment, net, on its Consolidated Balance Sheets under a capital lease. The lease payment on the\nfacilities is sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds. Because the Company owns all of the outstanding bonds, has a legal right to set-off, and intends to set-off the\ncorresponding lease and interest payment, the Company netted the capital lease obligation with the bond asset and, in turn, reflected no amount for the obligation or the\ncorresponding asset on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nContingencies. The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, a party to legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company\naccrues estimated costs for a contingency when management believes that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nNOTE 12: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n401(k) Plans. The Company has established 401(k) plans covering all U.S. employees after certain eligibility requirements are met. Amounts charged to operations for\nemployer contributions related to the plans totaled $2,810, $2,517, and $1,826 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nPost-Employment Benefits. The Company sponsors life insurance coverage as well as medical benefits, including prescription drug coverage, to certain retired employees and\ntheir spouses. In 2014, the Company made a change to the plan to terminate post-employment health care and life insurance benefits for retirees and employees, except for a\nspecified grandfathered group. As of December 31, 2023 the total current and non-current benefit obligations are immaterial.\nShare-Based Compensation Plans. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was authorized to issue 40,000,000 shares of Common Stock and had a treasury share balance of\n1,109,053 at December 31, 2023.\nThe Company currently has two active share-based compensation plans: the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan as amended (the “2014 Plan”) and the 2014 Non-Employee Director\nEquity Incentive Plan (the “Directors’ Plan”). The plans were approved by stockholders at the Company’s annual meeting in May 2014.\nThe Company’s share-based compensation plans provide for the awarding of stock options, stock appreciation rights, and shares of restricted stock and RSUs for senior\nexecutives and salaried employees, as well as for outside directors. Compensation expense related to RSU awards is based on the market price of the stock on the date the\nBoard of Directors\n62\ncommunicates the approved award and is amortized over the vesting period of the restricted stock award. The Consolidated Statements of Income for 2023, 2022, and 2021\nreflect total share-based compensation costs and director fees for awarded grants of $5,425, $3,487, and $2,346, respectively, related to these plans.\nFor long-term incentive awards to be granted in the form of RSUs in 2024 based on 2023 results, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (“HRCC”) determined\nthat the grants would have performance conditions that would be based on the same performance metrics as the Short-Term Incentive Plan (the “STI Plan”). The performance\nmetrics are adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), and adjusted EPS. Because management\ndetermined at the beginning of 2023 that the performance metrics would more likely than not be met, amortization of the estimated dollar pool of RSUs to be awarded based on\n2023 results was started in the first quarter over an estimated 48 month period, including 12 months to the grant date and an additional 36 months to the vesting date. The\nConsolidated Statements of Income for 2023, 2022, and 2021 reflects share-based compensation costs for grants to be awarded of $5,187, $2,018, and $960, respectively.\n2014 Plan. The 2014 Plan, with 1,500,000 shares registered for future grants, provides that vesting occurs pursuant to the time period specified in the particular award agreement\napproved for that issuance of RSUs, which is to be not less than three years unless vesting is accelerated due to the occurrence of certain events. As of December 31, 2023,\n658,081 RSUs had been granted from the 1,500,000 shares approved for under the 2014 Plan.\nDirectors’ Plan. The Director’s Plan, with 300,000 shares registered for future grants, provides that vesting occurs pursuant to the time period specified in the particular award\nagreement approved for that issuance of equity. As of December 31, 2023, 139,579 shares were granted from the 300,000 shares approved for grants under the Directors’ Plan\nand all 139,579 shares were vested.\nRSUs. The following table presents the summary of unvested RSUs under the Company’s share-based compensation plans for 2023, 2022, and 2021:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted Average Weighted Average Weighted Average\nGrant-Date Grant-Date Grant-Date Fair\nUnits Fair Value Units Fair Value Units Value\nUnvested balance at beginning of year 179,538 $ 65.11 167,994 $ 61.07 118,855 $ 60.56\nGranted 71,728 96.87 69,492 78.08 95,113 65.66\nForfeited (2,264) 81.76 (28,542) 61.11 (7,915) 62.77\nVested (22,592) 39.47 (29,406) 76.59 (38,059) 70.60\nUnvested balance at end of year 226,410 $ 77.56 179,538 $ 65.11 167,994 $ 61.07\nDuring 2023, 2022, and 2021, the total grant date fair value of RSU awards vested was $892, $2,252, and $2,687, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was $2,716 of\ntotal estimated unrecognized compensation costs (net of estimated forfeitures) related to granted RSU awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted\naverage period of approximately 1.0 year.\nUpon their vesting, the Company purchased restricted stock and RSUs from employees to cover associated withholding taxes. Total treasury stock purchases added 8,437 shares\nfor $801 in 2023; 9,031 shares for $715 in 2022; and 11,887 shares for $767 in 2021.\nAnnual Cash Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the STI Plan, short-term incentive compensation is dependent on the achievement of certain performance metrics, which are\nestablished by the HRCC. The degree of achievement of each financial performance metric for each plan year is calculated in accordance with the STI Plan. These calculations\nare approved by the HRCC, which may adjust results to eliminate unusual items. For 2023, 2022, and 2021, the financial performance metrics were adjusted operating income,\nadjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The HRCC also approves the amount of short-term incentive compensation paid for the plan year to officers and employees eligible to\nparticipate under the STI Plan. Additionally, certain employees within the Branded Spirits segment participate in incentive plans that are based on performance metrics,\nincluding the number of depleted cases and gross profit. Amounts expensed under the STI Plan totaled $13,443, $13,370, and $11,155 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n63\nDeferred Compensation Plan. The Company established an unfunded Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the “EDC Plan”) effective as of June 30, 2018, with a purpose\nto attract and retain highly-compensated key employees by providing participants with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and other specified\ncompensation. The Company’s obligations under this plan will change in conjunction with the performance of the participants’ investments, along with contributions to and\nwithdrawals from the plan. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on the EDC plan investments were insignificant and were included as a component of operating income in the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Income, because the Company’s deferred compensation investments consist of mutual funds that are considered trading securities.\nPlan investments are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy since the investments trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable the Company to obtain pricing\ninformation on an ongoing basis. The current portion of the EDC Plan deferrals is comprised of estimated amounts to be paid within one year depending on timing of planned\ndisbursements. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the EDC Plan investments were $2,916 and $2,176, respectively, which were recorded in other assets on the Company’s\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The EDC Plan current liabilities were $74 and $510 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were included in accrued expenses and\nother on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The EDC Plan non-current liabilities were $3,314 and $2,191 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which\nwere recorded in Other non-current liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNOTE 13: CONCENTRATIONS AND RELATED PARTIES\nSignificant customers. For 2023, the Company had sales to one customer that accounted for approximately 11 percent of consolidated sales. For 2022 and 2021, the Company\nhad no sales to an individual customer that accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated sales. During the years 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company’s ten largest\ncustomers accounted for approximately 44 percent, 38 percent, and 36 percent of consolidated sales, respectively.\nSignificant suppliers. For 2023, the Company had purchases from two grain suppliers that approximated2 0 percent of consolidated purchases. In addition, the Company’s ten\nlargest suppliers, accounted for approximately 51 percent of consolidated purchases.\nFor 2022, the Company had purchases from two grain suppliers that approximated2 3 percent of consolidated purchases. In addition, the Company’s ten largest suppliers\naccounted for approximately 49 percent of consolidated purchases.\nFor 2021, the Company had purchases from two grain suppliers that approximated1 4 percent of consolidated purchases. In addition, the Company’s ten largest suppliers\naccounted for approximately 43 percent of consolidated purchases.\nRelated Parties. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company purchased $41,520 and $37,274, respectively, of finished goods from LMX and bulk\nbeverage alcohol from the other 50 percent owner of DGL. The Company holds 50 percent interest in DGL and Agricola, which is accounted for as equity method investments.\nSee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nNOTE 14: OPERATING SEGMENTS\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had three segments: Distilling Solutions, Branded Spirits, and Ingredient Solutions. The Distilling Solutions segment consists of food\ngrade alcohol and distillery co-products, such as distillers feed (commonly called dried distillers grain in the industry) and fuel grade alcohol. The Distilling Solutions segment\nalso includes warehouse services, such as barrel put away, barrel storage, and barrel retrieval services. The Branded Spirits segment consists of a portfolio of high quality\nbranded spirits which are produced through the distilleries and bottling facilities. The Ingredient Solutions segment consists of specialty starches and proteins and commodity\nstarches and proteins.\nOperating profit for each segment is based on sales less identifiable operating expenses. Non-direct SG&A, interest expense, and other general miscellaneous expenses are\nexcluded from segment operations and are classified as Corporate. Receivables, inventories, and equipment have been identified with the segments to which they relate. All\nother assets are considered as Corporate.\n64\nThe following table presents summarized financial information for each segment:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nSales to customers:\nDistilling Solutions $ 450,854 $ 428,478 $ 352,504\nBranded Spirits 253,933 237,939 183,566\nIngredient Solutions 131,736 115,941 90,650\nTotal(a) $ 836,523 $ 782,358 $ 626,720\nGross profit:\nDistilling Solutions $ 144,964 $ 126,282 $ 114,106\nBranded Spirits 112,781 95,521 62,644\nIngredient Solutions 46,967 31,503 22,215\nTotal $ 304,712 $ 253,306 $ 198,965\nDepreciation and amortization:\nDistilling Solutions $ 11,833 $ 11,641 $ 10,766\nBranded Spirits 6,952 5,909 5,138\nIngredient Solutions 2,574 2,473 2,069\nCorporate 754 1,432 1,119\nTotal $ 22,113 $ 21,455 $ 19,092\nIncome (loss) before income taxes:\nDistilling Solutions $ 122,145 $ 121,651 $ 110,317\nBranded Spirits 33,829 33,333 20,742\nIngredient Solutions 40,729 27,532 19,194\nCorporate (54,957) (42,344) (29,157)\nTotal $ 141,746 $ 140,172 $ 121,096\n(a) Sales revenue from foreign sources totaled $49,822, $56,719, and $42,593 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and is\nlargely derived from the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Australia.

The purchase and sales agreement was entered into by both parties subsequent to Board approval and the\ntransaction closed in February 2024. The transaction was entered into at fair value based on two independent appraisers’ valuation; therefore, the transaction is deemed to have\nbeen conducted at an arm’s length.\nDividend Declaration. On February 22, 2024, the Company announced a quarterly dividend payable to stockholders of record of the Company’s Common Stock, resulting in\ndividend equivalents payable to RSU holders, of $0.12 per share and per RSU.

Definitions. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, defined terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement but defined in the Plan\nshall have the same definitions as in the Plan.\n2. Construction. Captions and titles contained herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of any\nprovision of this Agreement. Except when otherwise indicated by the context, the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall\ninclude the singular. Use of the term “or” is not intended to be exclusive, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.\n3. Grant of RSUs. Pursuant to action of the Board of Directors of the Company, as of the Date of Grant, the Company awards to\nParticipant the number of RSUs identified above; provided, however, that an RSU hereby awarded is nontransferable by Participant\nuntil the RSU's Vesting Date (defined below in Section 4). The RSUs are being granted by the Company to Participant as a RSU award\npursuant to the terms and provisions of the Plan, a true copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by\nreference.\n4. Vesting of RSUs and Payment of Shares; Fractional Shares.\na. The RSUs awarded under this Agreement will vest on a pro rata basis on each of the first through third anniversaries of the Date\nof Grant (each such anniversary a “Vesting Date” and the period from the Date of Grant to the final Vesting Date, the “Vesting\nPeriod”). Subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, Participant's vested RSUs will be settled through the\nissuance of shares of Stock following each Vesting Date, provided the RSUs have not been forfeited prior to such date in\naccordance with Section 5. Payment of shares of Stock (or, as provided below, cash for any fractional shares) will be made on,\nor no later than 30 days following, the Vesting Date. Any shares of Stock issued shall not be subject to any restriction on\ntransfer other than any such restriction as may be required pursuant to Section 7 or any applicable law, rule or regulation.\nb. In the event Participant is vested in a fractional portion of an RSU (a “Fractional Portion”), such Fractional Portion will not be\nconverted into a share of Stock or issued to Participant. Instead, the Fractional Portion will remain unvested (and unconverted)\nuntil the final Vesting Date for the RSUs; provided, however, if Participant vests in a subsequent Fractional Portion prior to the\nfinal Vesting Date\n1\nForm of RSU Agreement\n(Award Agreement for 3 Year Pro Rata Vesting)\nfor the RSUs and such Fractional Portion taken together with a previous Fractional Portion accrued by Participant under this\nAward would equal or exceed a whole Share, then such Fractional Portions will be converted into one share of Stock; provided,\nfurther, that following such conversion, any remaining Fractional Portion will remain unvested and unconverted. By way of\nexample, an award of 11 shares would result in the following vesting schedule: Year 1: 3 shares (3.667 rounds down to 3\nshares); Year 2: 4 shares (3.667 + .667 unvested from Year 1 = 4.33, which rounds down to 4), Year 3: 4 shares (3.667 + .33\nunvested from Year 2). Upon the final Vesting Date, the Company will not issue fractional shares of Stock, but the Committee\nmay, in its discretion, direct the Company to make a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares in an amount equal to the Fair\nMarket Value of such fractional share of Stock as of the day immediately preceding the date of the issuance of the shares of\nStock.\nc. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, or provisions of other compensation and benefits plans of the\nCompany, any payments due under this Agreement upon or in connection with a termination of Participant's employment that\nare subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code shall be deferred and paid (or commence, as the case may be) until\nthe first day on which such payments may be made without subjecting Participant to taxation pursuant to the provisions of\nSection 409A of the Code.\n5. Forfeiture. Prior to any Vesting Date, if Participant’s employment with the Company, or an Affiliate thereof, is terminated, other than\nby reason of an exception described in Section 6, then any RSUs (or fractional portion thereof) for which the Vesting Date has not yet\noccurred shall be forfeited by Participant to the Company and Participant shall thereafter have no right, title or interest whatever in such\nforfeited RSUs (or fractional portion thereof). Also, following the issuance of any shares of Stock following the Vesting Date (or\nearlier or later issuance date hereunder), the underlying RSUs pursuant to which an issuance of shares of Stock has occurred shall be\ncancelled.\n6. Exception to Forfeiture and Payment Date in Event of Death, Disability, Retirement or Qualifying Termination Following a Change in\nControl.\na. No forfeiture of any RSUs shall occur if Participant's Separation from Service as an employee is on account of Disability, death,\nor Retirement. “Retirement” for purposes of this Agreement shall mean Participant's Separation from Service with the Company\nor an Affiliate on or after the date Participant attains the age of 60 and completes five (5) years of service with the Company or\nan Affiliate.\nb. If Participant's Separation from Service occurs on account of death or Disability, the Vesting Date shall be accelerated to and be\ndeemed to be the date of the death or Disability. Payment of the shares of Stock shall be made as soon as practicable after such\nVesting Date but in no event more than 90 days following the date of death or Disability. No transfer by will or by laws of\ndescent and distribution of any shares of Stock which vest by reason of Participant’s death shall be effective to bind the\nCompany, unless the Company shall have been furnished with written notice of such transfer and a copy of the will or such\nother evidence as the Company may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer.\nc. If Participant's Separation from Service occurs on account of Retirement, Participant’s right to have the RSUs settled through\nthe issuance of shares of Stock shall “vest” at the time of such Retirement. However, no accelerated issuance of the shares of\nStock shall be made at the time of such Retirement. Rather, the issuance of shares of Stock shall be made on the original\nVesting Date as if Participant had remained employed through each such date.\n2\nForm of RSU Agreement\n(Award Agreement for 3 Year Pro Rata Vesting)\nd. Payment Upon Qualifying Termination Following a Change in Control. If Participant experiences a Qualifying Termination\nwithin 18 months following a Change in Control, all unvested RSUs shall become vested at the time of such Qualifying\nTermination and shall be settled with either payment of shares of Stock and/or some combination of cash or shares of Stock\nequaling the Fair Market Value of the new vested RSUs, all within 90 days of such Qualifying Termination.\nFor purposes of this Section 6.d, “Qualifying Termination” means Participant's: (a) involuntary termination of employment\nwithout Cause and other than as a result of Participant's death or Disability; or (b) voluntary termination of employment as a\nresult of Good Reason.\nFor purposes of this Section 6.d, “Cause” and “Good Reason” shall have the same definitions provided in any employment\nagreement or severance agreement applicable to Participant, or in the absence of such an applicable agreement, the MGP\nIngredients, Inc. Executive Severance Plan, if Participant is an eligible participant in such severance plan. If none of the\nforegoing definitions of “Cause” or Good Reason” applies, the following definitions shall apply:\ni. “Cause” means Participant's:\na. willful failure to perform his or her duties (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to\nphysical or mental illness);\nb. failure to comply with any valid and legal directive of the Board or the person to whom Participant\nreports;\nc. engagement in dishonesty, illegal conduct or gross misconduct, which is, in each case, materially\ninjurious to the Company or its Affiliates;\nd. embezzlement, misappropriation or fraud, whether or not related to Participant's employment with the\nCompany;\ne. conviction of or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a crime that constitutes a felony (or state law\nequivalent) or a crime that constitutes a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, if such felony or other\ncrime is work-related, materially impairs Participant's ability to perform services for the Company or\nresults in reputational or financial harm to the Company or its Affiliates;\nf. material violation of the Company's written policies or codes of conduct, including written policies related\nto discrimination, harassment, performance of illegal or unethical activities, and ethical misconduct; or\ng. engagement in conduct that brings or is reasonably likely to bring the Company negative publicity or into\npublic disgrace, embarrassment, or disrepute.\nii. “Good Reason” means the occurrence of any of the following:\n3\nForm of RSU Agreement\n(Award Agreement for 3 Year Pro Rata Vesting)\na. Participant is either (i) not offered a position of equal or greater responsibility immediately after the\nChange in Control as compared to Participant's position immediately prior to the Change in Control or,\n(ii) following the Change in Control, demoted to a position of materially lower responsibility than that\nposition originally offered and accepted by Participant in connection with the Change in Control;\nb. Participant's total direct compensation, which includes annual base salary, annual incentives and long-\nterm incentives, immediately after the Change in Control is less than Participant's total direct\ncompensation in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control; or\nc. Participant is required to relocate the Participant’s principal place of employment by more than 75 miles;\nprovided, however, in no event shall there be Good Reason unless Participant has provided written notice to the\nCompany of the existence of the circumstances providing grounds for termination for Good Reason within 30\ndays of the initial existence of such grounds and the Company has had at least 30 days from the date on which\nsuch notice is provided to cure such circumstances, if curable. If Participant does not terminate his or her\nemployment for Good Reason within 90 days after the first occurrence of the applicable grounds, then Participant\nwill be deemed to have waived his or her right to terminate for Good Reason with respect to such grounds.\n7. Restrictions on Grant of the RSUs and Issuance of Shares of Stock. The grant of the RSUs and issuance of shares of Stock upon\nsettlement of the vested RSUs shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with\nrespect to such securities, including requirements as amended after grant of the RSUs. No shares of Stock may be issued hereunder if\nthe issuance of such shares would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or\nregulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the shares of Stock may then be listed. The\ninability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal\ncounsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the RSU shall relieve the Company of any liability in\nrespect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the\nsettlement of the RSUs, the Company may require Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to\nevidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be\nrequested by the Company.\n8. Tax Withholding. Subject to the to the rights and limitations under the Plan, at the time of any payment of shares of Stock relating to\nvested RSUs, or any earlier time as necessary to comply with applicable tax laws, Participant hereby authorizes withholding from the\nRSUs such number of shares of Stock, valued at their Fair Market Value on the date so used, as may be required to satisfy the federal,\nstate, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company, if any, which arise in connection with the vesting of the RSUs or\nthe issuance of shares of Stock in settlement thereof. The Company shall reduce\n4\nForm of RSU Agreement\n(Award Agreement for 3 Year Pro Rata Vesting)\nthe number of shares issued to Participant on the Vesting Date (or any earlier payment date) by the number of shares required to cover\nthe tax withholding as of such date, such shares to be valued at their Fair Market Value on the applicable valuation date for tax\npurposes. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock until the tax withholding obligations of the Company have\nbeen satisfied by Participant.\n9. Restriction on Transfer. Participant may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of any RSUs to any other\nperson or entity during the Vesting Period. Any disposition or purported disposition made in violation of this Section 9 shall be null\nand void, and the Company shall not recognize or give effect to such disposition on its books and records.\n10.Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the settlement of a vested RSU and the issuance\nof shares of Stock.\n11.Employment. This Agreement shall not give Participant any right to continued employment with the Company or any Affiliate, and\nthe Company or any Affiliate employing Participant may terminate such employment or otherwise treat Participant without regard to\nthe effect it may have upon Participant or any RSUs under this Agreement.\n12.Covenants. Participant acknowledges that Participant’s agreement to this Section 12 is a key consideration for the Award made under\nthis Award Agreement. Participant hereby agrees to abide by the covenants set forth in this Section 12.\na. Covenant Against Solicitation of Employees.

Purpose\nThe Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of MGP\nIngredients, Inc.

Subject to and in accordance with the\nterms of this Policy, upon a Recoupment Event, each Covered Executive will be obligated to return to the Company, reasonably promptly,\nthe amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was received by such Covered Executive during the Lookback Period (in the case\nof each capitalized term used and not otherwise defined herein, as defined in Section III).\nII. Administration of the Policy\nThis Policy will be administered by the Committee. Any determinations made by the Committee will be final and binding on all\naffected individuals.\nIII. Definitions\n“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial\nreporting requirement under U.S. securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued\nfinancial statements that is (a) material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as a “Big R” restatement), or (b)\nwould result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly\nreferred to as a “little r” restatement).\n“Covered Executive” means each of the Company’s current and former Section 16 Officers.\n“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting\nRestatement, the excess of the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive during the Lookback Period\nover the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated\namounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Executive on such Incentive-Based Compensation. For Incentive-\nBased Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not\nsubject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement: (a) the amount must be based on a\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-\nBased Compensation was received; and (b) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate\nand provide such documentation to Nasdaq.\n“Financial Reporting Measures” are any measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles\nused in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and\ntotal shareholder return are also Financial Reporting Measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial\nstatements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” is any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment\nof a Financial Reporting Measure.\n“Lookback Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Required Restatement Date and any\ntransition period (that results from a change in the Company’s\nPolicy Owner: Human Resources and Compensation Committee\nfiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\nA “Recoupment Event” occurs when the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n“Required Restatement Date” means the earlier to occur of: (a) the date the Company’s Board, a committee of the Board, or the\nofficer(s) of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded,\nthat the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (b) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body\ndirects the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n“Section 16 Officer” is defined as an “officer” of the Company within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act.\nIV. Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy is such compensation that meets each of the\nfollowing conditions:\n(i) is received by a Covered Executive who was a Section 16 Officer on or after October 2, 2023 (even if such Incentive-Based\nCompensation was approved, awarded, or granted prior to this date);\n(ii) is received by a Covered Executive after the individual began service as a Section 16 Officer;\n(iii) the individual served as a Section 16 Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based\nCompensation; and\n(iv) is received by a Covered Executive while the Company has a class of securities listed on a U.S. national securities exchange\nor national securities association.\nThe amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery from a Covered Executive upon a Recoupment Event is the\nErroneously Awarded Compensation, which amount will be determined by the Committee.\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the\nFinancial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the\nIncentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nV. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nPromptly following a Recoupment Event, the Committee will determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each\nSection 16 Officer, and the Company will provide each such Covered Executive with a written notice of such amount and a demand for\nrepayment or return. Upon receipt of such notice, each affected Covered Executive must promptly repay or return such Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation to the Company.\nIf such repayment or return is not made within a reasonable time, the Company will recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in\na reasonable and prompt manner using any lawful method determined by the Committee, and by certifying this Policy a Covered Executive\nhereby consents to any lawful method of recovery; provided that recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation must be made in\ncompliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.\nVI. Limited Exceptions\nErroneously Awarded Compensation will be recovered in accordance with this Policy unless the Committee determines that\nrecovery would be impracticable and one of the following conditions is met:\n2\n• the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, provided the\nCompany has first made a reasonable effort to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation; or\n• the recovery would likely cause a U.S. tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of Internal Revenue Code\nSections 401(a)(13) and 411(a) and the regulations thereunder.\nReliance on either of the above exceptions must also comply with applicable listing standards, including without limitation,\ndocumenting the reason for the impracticability and providing required documentation to Nasdaq.\nVII. No Insurance or Indemnification\nNeither the Company nor any of its affiliates or subsidiaries may indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation (or related expenses incurred by the Covered Executive) pursuant to a recovery of Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation under this Policy, nor will the Company nor any of its affiliates or subsidiaries pay or reimburse a Covered\nExecutive for any insurance premiums on any insurance policy obtained by the Covered Executive to protect against the forfeiture or\nrecovery of any compensation pursuant to this Policy.\nVIII. Interpretation\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or\nadvisable for the administration of this Policy. This Policy will be applied and interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the\nrequirements of Rule 10D-1 and any applicable regulations, rules, or standards adopted by SEC or the rules of any national securities\nexchange or national securities association on which the Company’s securities are listed.

The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the\ncontrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy will be effective if that amendment or termination would cause the Company to violate\nany U.S. federal securities laws, SEC rules, or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the\nCompany’s securities are listed.\nX. Other Recoupment Rights\nAny right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be\navailable to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar provision in any employment agreement or other compensation plan or\nagreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.

To the extent that application of this Policy would provide for recovery of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation that the Company recovers pursuant to another policy or provision, the amount that is recovered will be credited to the\nrequired recovery under this Policy.\nXI.
