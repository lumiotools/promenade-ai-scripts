(“Allarity” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ALLR), a Phase 2 clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing personalized cancer treatments using its proprietary, drug-specific patient selection technology, today provided a corporate update highlighting three significant developments: extended treatment duration for patients in its ongoing Phase 2 stenoparib trial, a strengthened cash position supporting initiation of a follow-up FDA registrational trial, and new revenue-generating activities from Allarity’s laboratory services.\n\n**Key Progress in Phase 2 Stenoparib Trial** Two patients in Allarity’s Phase 2 clinical trial of stenoparib for advanced, recurrent ovarian cancer have now been on treatment for over 14 months, a remarkable duration of benefit given the heavily pretreated status of these patients. This extended duration further reinforces the potential of stenoparib as a promising treatment option for advanced ovarian cancer patients who have already undergone multiple lines of therapy, including prior PARP inhibitors.\n\n**Strong Financial Position Supports Advancement of Stenoparib Program** With a cash balance of $18.5 million as of September 30, 2024, Allarity Therapeutics is well-positioned to advance its clinical development programs. This solid financial foundation enables the Company to confidently initiate the next trial to advance stenoparib toward FDA registration.\n\n**Allarity Expands into Revenue-Generating Services for External Clients** Allarity Therapeutics is also pleased to announce that its in-house Allarity Medical Laboratory has expanded from solely focusing on supporting internal drug development to securing external service agreements, with multiple biotech companies now leveraging the Company’s advanced gene expression and diagnostic capabilities. This important expansion positions Allarity Medical Laboratory as a direct provider of revenue-generating, high-precision genomic services, establishing it as a valuable complementary asset for the Company.\n\nThese service agreements include contracts for both Drug Response Predictor (DRP®) analysis and comprehensive gene expression services, reflecting Allarity’s leading technology and ability to provide industry-leading insights to other innovators in the biotech field. The revenue generated from such agreements significantly reduce Allarity’s overall laboratory cost base while advancing the position of Allarity’s proprietary DRP® platform within the industry and supporting broader scientific advancements in oncology.\n\nThomas Jensen, CEO of Allarity Therapeutics, commented, “Seeing patients continue to benefit from stenoparib beyond 14 months is very encouraging for us at Allarity, as it goes beyond our initial hopes when we began the trial. We are pleased to see the lasting clinical benefit in these very advanced patients and think this reflects stenoparib’s unique therapeutic mechanism of action. We are excited that our strengthened cash position now provides the financial foundation to accelerate stenoparib’s clinical development toward FDA approval”\n\nHe added, “I am also excited about our successful seamless expansion into the service provider space. Over the years, our lab team has developed deep expertise in advanced genetic analysis to support cancer drug development, and naturally leveraging this to build a revenue-generating analytics department is extremely satisfying. In addition to generating meaningful revenue, this expansion further establishes our company, our brand and the DRP® platform within the oncology field.”\n\n**Background Information about the Trial** The above-mentioned trial is a Phase 2, prospective open-label, single-arm study with multiple sites in both the US and the UK. Investigators prescreened women with advanced, recurrent ovarian cancer using Allarity’s DRP® companion diagnostic (CDx), which comprises a complex transcriptomic signature of 414 mRNA biomarkers indicative of drug response or resistance. Each participant was assigned a DRP score, and those with scores above 50 -suggesting a higher likelihood of benefiting from treatment – were selected to receive stenoparib. The selected patients were administered stenoparib under a revised protocol implemented in Q1 2023, which involved a twice-daily dosing regimen (200 mg in the morning and 400 mg in the evening) instead of the previous once-daily 600 mg dose. This change was made to optimize daily drug exposure and target inhibition.\n\nThe patients enrolled have advanced through multiple lines of therapy, including platinum, taxanes, anti-angiogenesis inhibitors, and even the recently approved Antibody Drug Conjugate, Elahere. Importantly, most of the enrolled patients to date have been previously treated with a PARP inhibitor. These patients have few, if any, effective treatment options and typically advance through available therapies after only a few months.\n\n**About stenoparib** Stenoparib is an orally available, small-molecule dual-targeted inhibitor of PARP1/2 and tankyrase 1/2. At present, tankyrases are attracting significant attention as emerging therapeutic targets for cancer, principally due to their role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in the development and progression of numerous cancers. By inhibiting PARP and blocking Wnt pathway activation, stenoparib’s unique therapeutic action shows potential as a promising therapeutic. Allarity has exclusive global rights for the development and commercialization of stenoparib, which was originally developed by Eisai Co. Ltd. and was formerly known under the names E7449 and 2X-121.\n\n**About the Drug Response Predictor – DRP****®****Companion Diagnostic** Allarity uses its drug-specific DRP® to select those patients who, by the gene expression signature of their cancer, are found to have a high likelihood of benefiting from a specific drug. By screening patients before treatment, and only treating those patients with a sufficiently high, drug-specific DRP score, the therapeutic benefit rate may be significantly increased. The DRP method builds on the comparison of sensitive vs. resistant human cancer cell lines, including transcriptomic information from cell lines combined with clinical tumor biology filters and prior clinical trial outcomes. DRP is based on messenger RNA expression profiles from patient biopsies. The DRP® platform has proven its ability to provide a statistically significant prediction of the clinical outcome from drug treatment in cancer patients dozens of clinical studies (both retrospective and prospective). The DRP platform, which can be used in all cancer types and is patented for more than 70 anti-cancer drugs, has been extensively published in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\n**About Allarity Therapeutics** Allarity Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALLR) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing personalized cancer treatments. The Company is focused on development of stenoparib, a novel PARP/tankyrase inhibitor for advanced ovarian cancer patients, using its DRP® companion diagnostic for patient selection in the ongoing phase 2 clinical trial, NCT03878849. Allarity is headquartered in the U.S., with a research facility in Denmark, and is committed to addressing significant unmet medical needs in cancer treatment.

(“Allarity” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ALLR), a Phase 2 clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing personalized cancer treatments using its proprietary, drug-specific patient selection technology, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided an update on recent operational highlights.\n\n“This quarter’s progress marks a steady period of advancement for Allarity as we have maintained a strong cash position, achieved record patient duration on stenoparib treatment, and welcomed new members to our leadership team who bring the expertise needed to shape a successful future for the Company,” said Thomas Jensen, CEO of Allarity Therapeutics. “We continue to drive the development of our promising, novel dual PARP/tankyrase inhibitor, stenoparib, forward, and we remain optimistic that our efforts will ultimately bring new hope to ovarian cancer patients, especially those who currently have few or no treatment options.”\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights_**\n\n  * **Encouraging Patient Outcomes in Phase 2 Stenoparib Trial** : On September 16, 2024, the Company announced that two patients in its Phase 2 trial for stenoparib in advanced ovarian cancer had exceeded one year on treatment, demonstrating durable clinical benefit in this heavily pre-treated population and highlighting the potential of stenoparib as a meaningful treatment option for patients with limited or no alternatives.\n  * **New Leadership to Drive Clinical Development:** The Company, led by President and Chief Development Officer Jeremy R. Graff, Ph.D., and Consultant Chief Medical Officer Jose Iglesias, M.D., both appointed in October 2024, is working closely with its scientific advisors to prepare a follow-on trial aimed at FDA regulatory intent. Dr. Graff—a distinguished oncology expert with over 25 years in drug development who previously served as a consultant to Allarity—and Dr. Iglesias—a seasoned leader in oncology clinical trials and former Celgene executive—bring invaluable experience and strategic insight to advance Allarity’s clinical trial efforts.\n\n\n  * **Appointment of New CFO** : In September 2024, Allarity appointed Alexander Epshinsky as Chief Financial Officer. With nearly a decade of financial leadership experience in the biotech sector, Mr. Epshinsky brings valuable expertise to support the Company’s financial strategy as it advances the development of stenoparib.\n  * **European Patent Secured for Stenoparib DRP****®** : The Company was granted a European patent in October 2024 for its proprietary DRP® companion diagnostic specific to stenoparib, strengthening Allarity’s market position by securing critical IP protection for this unique diagnostic in an important market. Patent applications are also pending in other key regions, including the U.S., Japan, and China.\n  * **Regained NASDAQ Compliance** : In October 2024, the Company received formal notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC confirming that it had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, effectively concluding the previously disclosed listing matter. \n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights_**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, Allarity had cash and cash equivalents of $18.5 million, compared to $0.2 million at December 31, 2023. The Company maintains a financial runway extending into 2026.\n\n**R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.0 million, compared to $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, the Company recorded a $9.7 million intangible asset impairment charge (non-cash) for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**G &A Expenses:** General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.6 million, compared to $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $12.2 million (primarily due to the aforementioned $9.7 million intangible asset impairment charge), compared to a net loss of $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**About the Drug Response Predictor – DRP® Companion Diagnostic** Allarity uses its drug-specific DRP® to select those patients who, by the gene expression signature of their cancer, are found to have a high likelihood of benefiting from a specific drug.

(“Allarity” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ALLR), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing personalized cancer treatments using its proprietary, drug-specific patient selection technology, today announced that the European Patent Office (EPO) has issued a formal notice of its intention to grant a patent for Allarity’s Drug Response Predictor (DRP®) companion diagnostic specific to stenoparib, the Company’s dual-targeted PARP/Tankyrase inhibitor.\n\nThis patent represents a significant step forward in securing Allarity’s market position for stenoparib and the Stenoparib DRP companion diagnostic, which identifies patients most likely to derive clinical benefit from stenoparib treatment. \n\nThomas Jensen, CEO of Allarity Therapeutics, commented, “As we advance our clinical program for stenoparib, we are also focused on securing patents in key markets to pave the way for potential future commercialization. Though our main focus is to first achieve regulatory approval in the US for both stenoparib and its DRP companion diagnostic, we strongly believe stenoparib has the potential to help ovarian cancer patients worldwide. Therefore, knowing that the EPO intends to grant us a European patent for the Stenoparib DRP is an important step towards securing the foundation for an international market position for stenoparib and its companion diagnostic.”\n\nPatent applications for the Stenoparib DRP companion diagnostic are also pending in the United States, Japan, China, Australia, and India. Allarity has previously been granted 17 patents for drug-specific DRPs, including eight in the United States. \n\n**About Stenoparib** Stenoparib is an orally available, small-molecule, dual-targeted inhibitor of PARP1/2 and Tankyrase 1 and 2. At present, tankyrases are attracting significant attention as emerging therapeutic targets for cancer, principally due to their role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in the development and progression of numerous cancers. By inhibiting PARP and also blocking Wnt pathway activation, stenoparib’s unique therapeutic action shows potential as a promising therapeutic. Allarity has exclusive global rights for the development and commercialization of stenoparib, which was originally developed by Eisai Co. Ltd. and was formerly known under the names E7449 and 2X-121.\n\n**About the Drug Response Predictor – DRP® Companion Diagnostic** Allarity uses its drug-specific DRP® to select those patients who, by the gene expression signature of their cancer, are found to have a high likelihood of benefiting from a specific drug. By screening patients before treatment, and only treating those patients with a sufficiently high, drug-specific DRP score, the therapeutic benefit rate may be significantly increased. The DRP method builds on the comparison of sensitive vs. resistant human cancer cell lines, including transcriptomic information from cell lines combined with clinical tumor biology filters and prior clinical trial outcomes. DRP is based on messenger RNA expression profiles from patient biopsies. The DRP® platform has proven its ability to provide a statistically significant prediction of the clinical outcome from drug treatment in cancer patients dozens of clinical studies (both retrospective and prospective). The DRP platform, which can be used in all cancer types and is patented for more than 70 anti-cancer drugs, has been extensively published in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\n**About Allarity Therapeutics** Allarity Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALLR) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing personalized cancer treatments. The Company is focused on development of stenoparib, a novel PARP/Tankyrase inhibitor for advanced ovarian cancer patients, using its DRP® companion diagnostic for patient selection in the ongoing phase 2 clinical trial, NCT03878849. Allarity is headquartered in the U.S., with a research facility in Denmark, and is committed to addressing significant unmet medical needs in cancer treatment.

(“Allarity” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ALLR), a Phase 2 clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing personalized cancer treatments using its proprietary, drug-specific patient selection technology, today provided a corporate update highlighting three significant developments: extended treatment duration for patients in its ongoing Phase 2 stenoparib trial, a strengthened cash position supporting initiation of a follow-up FDA registrational trial, and new revenue-generating activities from Allarity’s laboratory services.\n\n**Key Progress in Phase 2 Stenoparib Trial** Two patients in Allarity’s Phase 2 clinical trial of stenoparib for advanced, recurrent ovarian cancer have now been on treatment for over 14 months, a remarkable duration of benefit given the heavily pretreated status of these patients. This extended duration further reinforces the potential of stenoparib as a promising treatment option for advanced ovarian cancer patients who have already undergone multiple lines of therapy, including prior PARP inhibitors.\n\n**Strong Financial Position Supports Advancement of Stenoparib Program** With a cash balance of $18.5 million as of September 30, 2024, Allarity Therapeutics is well-positioned to advance its clinical development programs. This solid financial foundation enables the Company to confidently initiate the next trial to advance stenoparib toward FDA registration.\n\n**Allarity Expands into Revenue-Generating Services for External Clients** Allarity Therapeutics is also pleased to announce that its in-house Allarity Medical Laboratory has expanded from solely focusing on supporting internal drug development to securing external service agreements, with multiple biotech companies now leveraging the Company’s advanced gene expression and diagnostic capabilities. This important expansion positions Allarity Medical Laboratory as a direct provider of revenue-generating, high-precision genomic services, establishing it as a valuable complementary asset for the Company.\n\nThese service agreements include contracts for both Drug Response Predictor (DRP®) analysis and comprehensive gene expression services, reflecting Allarity’s leading technology and ability to provide industry-leading insights to other innovators in the biotech field. The revenue generated from such agreements significantly reduce Allarity’s overall laboratory cost base while advancing the position of Allarity’s proprietary DRP® platform within the industry and supporting broader scientific advancements in oncology.\n\nThomas Jensen, CEO of Allarity Therapeutics, commented, “Seeing patients continue to benefit from stenoparib beyond 14 months is very encouraging for us at Allarity, as it goes beyond our initial hopes when we began the trial. We are pleased to see the lasting clinical benefit in these very advanced patients and think this reflects stenoparib’s unique therapeutic mechanism of action. We are excited that our strengthened cash position now provides the financial foundation to accelerate stenoparib’s clinical development toward FDA approval”\n\nHe added, “I am also excited about our successful seamless expansion into the service provider space. Over the years, our lab team has developed deep expertise in advanced genetic analysis to support cancer drug development, and naturally leveraging this to build a revenue-generating analytics department is extremely satisfying. In addition to generating meaningful revenue, this expansion further establishes our company, our brand and the DRP® platform within the oncology field.”\n\n**Background Information about the Trial** The above-mentioned trial is a Phase 2, prospective open-label, single-arm study with multiple sites in both the US and the UK. Investigators prescreened women with advanced, recurrent ovarian cancer using Allarity’s DRP® companion diagnostic (CDx), which comprises a complex transcriptomic signature of 414 mRNA biomarkers indicative of drug response or resistance. Each participant was assigned a DRP score, and those with scores above 50 -suggesting a higher likelihood of benefiting from treatment – were selected to receive stenoparib. The selected patients were administered stenoparib under a revised protocol implemented in Q1 2023, which involved a twice-daily dosing regimen (200 mg in the morning and 400 mg in the evening) instead of the previous once-daily 600 mg dose. This change was made to optimize daily drug exposure and target inhibition.\n\nThe patients enrolled have advanced through multiple lines of therapy, including platinum, taxanes, anti-angiogenesis inhibitors, and even the recently approved Antibody Drug Conjugate, Elahere. Importantly, most of the enrolled patients to date have been previously treated with a PARP inhibitor. These patients have few, if any, effective treatment options and typically advance through available therapies after only a few months.\n\n**About stenoparib** Stenoparib is an orally available, small-molecule dual-targeted inhibitor of PARP1/2 and tankyrase 1/2. At present, tankyrases are attracting significant attention as emerging therapeutic targets for cancer, principally due to their role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in the development and progression of numerous cancers. By inhibiting PARP and blocking Wnt pathway activation, stenoparib’s unique therapeutic action shows potential as a promising therapeutic. Allarity has exclusive global rights for the development and commercialization of stenoparib, which was originally developed by Eisai Co. Ltd. and was formerly known under the names E7449 and 2X-121.\n\n**About the Drug Response Predictor – DRP****®****Companion Diagnostic** Allarity uses its drug-specific DRP® to select those patients who, by the gene expression signature of their cancer, are found to have a high likelihood of benefiting from a specific drug. By screening patients before treatment, and only treating those patients with a sufficiently high, drug-specific DRP score, the therapeutic benefit rate may be significantly increased. The DRP method builds on the comparison of sensitive vs. resistant human cancer cell lines, including transcriptomic information from cell lines combined with clinical tumor biology filters and prior clinical trial outcomes. DRP is based on messenger RNA expression profiles from patient biopsies. The DRP® platform has proven its ability to provide a statistically significant prediction of the clinical outcome from drug treatment in cancer patients dozens of clinical studies (both retrospective and prospective). The DRP platform, which can be used in all cancer types and is patented for more than 70 anti-cancer drugs, has been extensively published in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\n**About Allarity Therapeutics** Allarity Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALLR) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing personalized cancer treatments. The Company is focused on development of stenoparib, a novel PARP/tankyrase inhibitor for advanced ovarian cancer patients, using its DRP® companion diagnostic for patient selection in the ongoing phase 2 clinical trial, NCT03878849. Allarity is headquartered in the U.S., with a research facility in Denmark, and is committed to addressing significant unmet medical needs in cancer treatment.

(“Allarity” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ALLR), a Phase 2 clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing personalized cancer treatments using its proprietary, drug-specific patient selection technology, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided an update on recent operational highlights.\n\n“This quarter’s progress marks a steady period of advancement for Allarity as we have maintained a strong cash position, achieved record patient duration on stenoparib treatment, and welcomed new members to our leadership team who bring the expertise needed to shape a successful future for the Company,” said Thomas Jensen, CEO of Allarity Therapeutics. “We continue to drive the development of our promising, novel dual PARP/tankyrase inhibitor, stenoparib, forward, and we remain optimistic that our efforts will ultimately bring new hope to ovarian cancer patients, especially those who currently have few or no treatment options.”\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights_**\n\n  * **Encouraging Patient Outcomes in Phase 2 Stenoparib Trial** : On September 16, 2024, the Company announced that two patients in its Phase 2 trial for stenoparib in advanced ovarian cancer had exceeded one year on treatment, demonstrating durable clinical benefit in this heavily pre-treated population and highlighting the potential of stenoparib as a meaningful treatment option for patients with limited or no alternatives.\n  * **New Leadership to Drive Clinical Development:** The Company, led by President and Chief Development Officer Jeremy R. Graff, Ph.D., and Consultant Chief Medical Officer Jose Iglesias, M.D., both appointed in October 2024, is working closely with its scientific advisors to prepare a follow-on trial aimed at FDA regulatory intent. Dr. Graff—a distinguished oncology expert with over 25 years in drug development who previously served as a consultant to Allarity—and Dr. Iglesias—a seasoned leader in oncology clinical trials and former Celgene executive—bring invaluable experience and strategic insight to advance Allarity’s clinical trial efforts.\n\n\n  * **Appointment of New CFO** : In September 2024, Allarity appointed Alexander Epshinsky as Chief Financial Officer. With nearly a decade of financial leadership experience in the biotech sector, Mr. Epshinsky brings valuable expertise to support the Company’s financial strategy as it advances the development of stenoparib.\n  * **European Patent Secured for Stenoparib DRP****®** : The Company was granted a European patent in October 2024 for its proprietary DRP® companion diagnostic specific to stenoparib, strengthening Allarity’s market position by securing critical IP protection for this unique diagnostic in an important market. Patent applications are also pending in other key regions, including the U.S., Japan, and China.\n  * **Regained NASDAQ Compliance** : In October 2024, the Company received formal notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC confirming that it had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, effectively concluding the previously disclosed listing matter. \n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights_**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, Allarity had cash and cash equivalents of $18.5 million, compared to $0.2 million at December 31, 2023. The Company maintains a financial runway extending into 2026.\n\n**R &D Expenses:** Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.0 million, compared to $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, the Company recorded a $9.7 million intangible asset impairment charge (non-cash) for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**G &A Expenses:** General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.6 million, compared to $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $12.2 million (primarily due to the aforementioned $9.7 million intangible asset impairment charge), compared to a net loss of $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**About the Drug Response Predictor – DRP® Companion Diagnostic** Allarity uses its drug-specific DRP® to select those patients who, by the gene expression signature of their cancer, are found to have a high likelihood of benefiting from a specific drug. By screening patients before treatment, and only treating those patients with a sufficiently high, drug-specific DRP score, the therapeutic benefit rate may be significantly increased. The DRP method builds on the comparison of sensitive vs. resistant human cancer cell lines, including transcriptomic information from cell lines combined with clinical tumor biology filters and prior clinical trial outcomes. DRP is based on messenger RNA expression profiles from patient biopsies. The DRP® platform has proven its ability to provide a statistically significant prediction of the clinical outcome from drug treatment in cancer patients dozens of clinical studies (both retrospective and prospective). The DRP platform, which can be used in all cancer types and is patented for more than 70 anti-cancer drugs, has been extensively published in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\n**About Allarity Therapeutics** Allarity Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALLR) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing personalized cancer treatments. The Company is focused on development of stenoparib, a novel PARP/tankyrase inhibitor for advanced ovarian cancer patients, using its DRP® companion diagnostic for patient selection in the ongoing phase 2 clinical trial, NCT03878849. Allarity is headquartered in the U.S., with a research facility in Denmark, and is committed to addressing significant unmet medical needs in cancer treatment.
