These and other equally important factors are described in reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the factors described under the sections titled “Risk Factors” in our most recently submitted annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in this press release whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n\nNetApp, the NetApp logo, and the marks listed at [www.netapp.com/TM](/company/legal/trademarks \"Trademarks\") are trademarks of NetApp, Inc. All other marks are the property of their respective owners.\n\n**NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financial Information** To supplement NetApp’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), NetApp provides investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP operating results, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow, billings, and historical and projected non-GAAP earnings per diluted share.\n\nIn prior periods, NetApp presented the hardware and software components of our GAAP product revenues to illustrate the significance and value of the Company’s software. Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP measures.\n\nEffective in fiscal year 2025, NetApp no longer presents the non-GAAP hardware and software components of our product revenues, as management no longer considers them to be key financial measures. The Company’s current strategy is expected to deliver investor value through growth in total revenues, including product revenues, while maintaining operational discipline to drive earnings leverage. While software continues to be the primary value driver of our products, NetApp is primarily focused on driving growth in total product revenues, through the sale of configured storage systems comprised of both hardware and software, with less focus on the pricing of each component.\n\nAdditionally, the Company is considering potential opportunities to simplify pricing for certain products in the future, which may eliminate the existence of separate prices for hardware and software components and/or impact our ability to allocate between them.\n\nNetApp believes that the presentation of its non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. NetApp’s management uses non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes that the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance.\n\nNetApp believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per share data, provides investors with supplemental metrics that assist in understanding current results and future prospects, earnings and profitability that are complementary to GAAP metrics. Each of these Non-GAAP metrics is defined as the applicable GAAP metric adjusted to exclude the items defined in A through I below, as applicable, while our Non-GAAP effective tax rate and Non-GAAP net income also reflect a non-GAAP tax provision, as described in item J below, instead of our GAAP tax provision. Non-GAAP net income per share is computed as Non-GAAP net income divided by the diluted number of shares for the applicable period.\n\nNetApp believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which it defines as the net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in its business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on its common stock. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.\n\nNetApp approximates billings by adding net revenues as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period to the change in total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the same period. Billings is a performance measure that NetApp believes provides useful information to management and investors because it approximates the amounts under purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors’ operating results and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making.\n\nNetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures when applicable:\n\n  1. Amortization of intangible assets. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.\n  2. Stock-based compensation expenses. NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the amount can fluctuate based on variables unrelated to the performance of the underlying business. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period.\n  3. Litigation settlements. NetApp may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. NetApp excludes these charges and benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results.\n  4. Acquisition-related expenses. NetApp excludes acquisition-related expenses, including (a) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges and (b) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are not related to our ongoing business or cost base and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.\n  5. Restructuring charges. These charges consist of restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.\n  6. Asset impairments. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.\n  7. Gains/losses on the sale or derecognition of assets. These are gains/losses from the sale of our properties and other transactions in which we transfer and/or lose control of assets to a third party. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, ongoing business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting\n  8. Gains/losses on the sale of investments in equity securities. These are gains/losses from the sale of our investment in certain equity securities. Typically, such investments are sold as a result of a change in control of the underlying businesses. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, ongoing business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.\n  9. Debt extinguishment costs. NetApp excludes certain non-recurring expenses incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of debt. Management believes such non-recurring costs do not reflect the results of its underlying, ongoing business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.\n  10. Income tax adjustments. NetApp’s non-GAAP tax provision is based upon a projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The non-GAAP tax provision also excludes, when applicable, (a) tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal periods that are a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, authoritative guidance, income tax audit settlements, statute lapses and/or court decisions, (b) tax charges or benefits that are attributable to unusual or non-recurring book and/or tax accounting method changes, (c) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a non-routine foreign cash repatriation, (d) tax charges or benefits that are a result of infrequent restructuring of the Company’s tax structure, (e) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in valuation allowance, and (f) tax charges or benefits resulting from the integration of intellectual property from acquisitions. Management believes that the use of non-GAAP tax provisions provides a more meaningful measure of the Company’s operational performance.\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NetApp believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. NetApp management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and projected results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP results can be found herein.\n\n**Constant currency** In periods in which the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes are significant, NetApp presents certain constant currency growth rates or quantifies the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on year-over-year fluctuations, including for net revenues, billings, and earnings. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results.\n\n**About NetApp** NetApp is the intelligent data infrastructure company, combining unified data storage, integrated data services, and CloudOps solutions to turn a world of disruption into opportunity for every customer.

Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP measures. \n\nEffective in fiscal year 2025, NetApp no longer presents the non-GAAP hardware and software components of our product revenues, as management no longer considers them to be key financial measures. The Company’s current strategy is expected to deliver investor value through growth in total revenues, including product revenues, while maintaining operational discipline to drive earnings leverage. While software continues to be the primary value driver of our products, NetApp is primarily focused on driving growth in total product revenues, through the sale of configured storage systems comprised of both hardware and software, with less focus on the pricing of each component. \n\nAdditionally, the Company is considering potential opportunities to simplify pricing for certain products in the future, which may eliminate the existence of separate prices for hardware and software components and/or impact our ability to allocate between them. \n\nNetApp believes that the presentation of its non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. NetApp’s management uses non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes that the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance. \n\nNetApp believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per share data, provides investors with supplemental metrics that assist in understanding current results and future prospects, earnings and profitability that are complementary to GAAP metrics. Each of these Non-GAAP metrics is defined as the applicable GAAP metric adjusted to exclude the items defined in A through I below, as applicable, while our Non-GAAP effective tax rate and Non-GAAP net income also reflect a non-GAAP tax provision, as described in item J below, instead of our GAAP tax provision. Non-GAAP net income per share is computed as Non-GAAP net income divided by the diluted number of shares for the applicable period. \n\nNetApp believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which it defines as the net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in its business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on its common stock. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows. \n\nNetApp approximates billings by adding net revenues as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period to the change in total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the same period. Billings is a performance measure that NetApp believes provides useful information to management and investors because it approximates the amounts under purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors’ operating results and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. \n\nNetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures when applicable: \n\nA. Amortization of intangible assets. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance. \n\nB. Stock-based compensation expenses. NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the amount can fluctuate based on variables unrelated to the performance of the underlying business. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. \n\nC. Litigation settlements. NetApp may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. NetApp excludes these charges and benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. \n\nD. Acquisition-related expenses. NetApp excludes acquisition-related expenses, including (a) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges and (b) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are not related to our ongoing business or cost base and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting. \n\nE. Restructuring charges. These charges consist of restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance. \n\nF. Asset impairments. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance. \n\nG. Gains/losses on the sale or derecognition of assets. These are gains/losses from the sale of our properties and other transactions in which we transfer and/or lose control of assets to a third party. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, ongoing business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting. \n\nH. Gains/losses on the sale of investments in equity securities. These are gains/losses from the sale of our investment in certain equity securities. Typically, such investments are sold as a result of a change in control of the underlying businesses. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, ongoing business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting. \n\nI. Debt extinguishment costs. NetApp excludes certain non-recurring expenses incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of debt. Management believes such non-recurring costs do not reflect the results of its underlying, ongoing business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting. \n\nJ. Income tax adjustments. NetApp’s non-GAAP tax provision is based upon a projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The non-GAAP tax provision also excludes, when applicable, (a) tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal periods that are a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, authoritative guidance, income tax audit settlements, statute lapses and/or court decisions, (b) tax charges or benefits that are attributable to unusual or non-recurring book and/or tax accounting method changes, (c) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a non-routine foreign cash repatriation, (d) tax charges or benefits that are a result of infrequent restructuring of the Company’s tax structure, (e) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in valuation allowance, and (f) tax charges or benefits resulting from the integration of intellectual property from acquisitions. Management believes that the use of non-GAAP tax provisions provides a more meaningful measure of the Company’s operational performance. \n\nNon-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NetApp believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. NetApp management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and projected results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP results can be found herein. \n\n**Constant Currency**\n\nIn periods in which the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes are significant, NetApp presents certain constant currency growth rates or quantifies the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on year-over-year fluctuations, including for net revenues, billings, and earnings. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results. \n\n**About NetApp**\n\nNetApp is the intelligent data infrastructure company, combining unified data storage, integrated data services, and CloudOps solutions to turn a world of disruption into opportunity for every customer.

By uniting NetApp’s intelligent data infrastructure with Red Hat OpenShift, this collaboration offers customers more flexibility to manage their virtualized environments more seamlessly on-premises and in the hybrid multicloud. \n\nCompanies are under increasing pressure to innovate quickly, developing new and differentiated enterprise applications that can simplify ongoing business operations or drive improved outcomes for customers. [Red Hat OpenShift](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redhat.com%2Fen%2Ftechnologies%2Fcloud-computing%2Fopenshift&esheet=54149961&newsitemid=20241111713494&lan=en-US&anchor=Red+Hat+OpenShift&index=1&md5=841a0c338933f753d7fcce5d4eeb3875) is the industry’s leading hybrid cloud application platform powered by Kubernetes and trusted by thousands of companies, including more than half of the top 25 Global Fortune 500, to help streamline application lifecycles and drive innovation for AI. NetApp is expanding its work with Red Hat to deliver enhancements to its intelligent data infrastructure to reduce costs and increase the flexibility of Red Hat OpenShift environments as customers develop, manage, secure and protect Kubernetes containerized workloads and virtualized applications. \n\n“In today’s ever-changing technology landscape, organizations need to embrace flexibility and agility so they can adapt and create a winning strategy,” said Jonsi Stefansson, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at NetApp. “Developing, deploying, and managing modern enterprise applications requires high-performance and secure, persistent flash storage and advanced data management capabilities. NetApp intelligent data infrastructure with Red Hat OpenShift makes it simpler and faster for customers to adopt and manage their virtualized environments, as well as deliver performance, mobility and security for critical data managed on Red Hat OpenShift AI.” \n\nTo support the expanded collaboration with Red Hat, NetApp is announcing new capabilities that give customers more flexibility in how they deploy and manage virtual environments, especially as they leverage Red Hat OpenShift, including: \n\n  * **Trident:** The container storage interface (CSI) integration for Trident provides Red Hat customers running Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization direct and simplified access to NetApp ONTAP® advanced replication and disaster recovery software. This allows Red Hat OpenShift operations teams and DevOps teams to use their existing familiar management interfaces and pull ONTAP functionality into their existing workflows, while also leveraging high-performance, all-flash storage that maintains persistence even as virtual machines or containers are created, modified, or removed. NetApp is releasing a new version of Trident that includes integrated protection, migration, and disaster recovery capabilities at no additional cost. In addition, it extends support for Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. \n  * **Cisco FlexPod Validated Designs for Red Hat:** NetApp has released new validated designs for Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization and Red Hat OpenShift AI deployments on its Cisco FlexPod converged infrastructure solution. This gives customers greater confidence that their Red Hat virtualized and modern AI workloads **can** run smoothly through a single point of support and delivery as they leverage virtualization and container management, network, server and storage functionality. \n  * **Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes on Google Cloud:** A new integration with NetApp Volumes gives customers the option to use a first-party storage service in Google Cloud to run their containerized workloads, giving them increased flexibility to leverage persistent enterprise storage built on NetApp ONTAP. With Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, enterprises have a fully managed application platform to help ensure their clusters work as expected with expert support. Now, customers have a supported way to move Red Hat OpenShift workloads to Google Cloud and benefit from NetApp ONTAP intelligent data infrastructure capabilities. \n\n\n\n“We believe in the power of open source software to help businesses access the latest features and capabilities to run their IT environments,” said Stefanie Chiras, Senior Vice President, Partner Ecosystem Success, Red Hat. “At the core of the open-source philosophy is collaboration, and in that spirit, we are expanding our collaboration with NetApp to help empower customers with the flexibility they need to drive innovation in their virtualized environments. Intelligent data infrastructure from NetApp provides a solid foundation for Red Hat OpenShift customers to further modernize and protect the applications running in their virtual deployments and Kubernetes containers.” \n\nTo explore these new integrations and learn how NetApp can enhance your Red Hat OpenShift deployments, visit the NetApp booth #R45 at KubeCon in Salt Lake City, Utah from November 12-15, 2024. \n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n  * [Start Your Modernization Journey with a Unified Platform for Virtualization and Containers](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redhat.com%2Fen%2Fevents%2Fwebinar%2Fstart-your-modernization-journey-with-a-unified-platform-for-virtualization-and-containers%3Fsc_cid%3D7015Y0000048jCWQAY&esheet=54149961&newsitemid=20241111713494&lan=en-US&anchor=Start+Your+Modernization+Journey+with+a+Unified+Platform+for+Virtualization+and+Containers&index=2&md5=c759530112dcb2196354b27d261a09af)\n  * [Announcing NetApp® Trident™ Version 24.10: Enabling NetApp as the best storage for Kubernetes](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netapp.com%2Fblog%2Ftrident-24-10-best-storage-kubernetes%2F&esheet=54149961&newsitemid=20241111713494&lan=en-US&anchor=Announcing+NetApp%26%23174%3B+Trident%26%238482%3B+Version+24.10%3A+Enabling+NetApp+as+the+best+storage+for+Kubernetes&index=3&md5=e87efe3ef5fbe1dfca3f13b6a4e19769)\n\n\n\n**About NetApp**\n\nNetApp is the intelligent data infrastructure company, combining unified data storage, integrated data services, and CloudOps solutions to turn a world of disruption into opportunity for every customer.
