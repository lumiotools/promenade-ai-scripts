November 11 2024\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intevac, Inc. (Nasdaq: IVAC) today reported financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 28, 2024. \n\n“We are pleased to report third-quarter results favorable to our expectations going into the quarter,” commented Nigel Hunton, president and chief executive officer. “Technology upgrades in support of next-generation HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) media continue to drive the majority of our business, and total revenues from HDD upgrades, spares, and field service totaled over $13 million, exceeding our expectations. With an additional $15 million of largely pass-through revenue associated with the transfer of inventory to a customer, the gross margin and earnings per share performance of the core business likewise exceeded expectations. Positive free cash flow performance in the quarter drove an increase in total cash, restricted cash, and investments to over $72 million at quarter-end, and we remain on track to maintain the strength of the balance sheet in 2024 to enable strategic investments in support of future growth.” \n\n_($ Millions, except per share amounts)_  \n---  \nThree Months Ended  |  Three Months Ended   \nSeptember 28, 2024 |  September 30, 2023  \nGAAP Results  |  Non-GAAP Results  |  GAAP Results  |  Non-GAAP Results   \nNet Revenues  |  $  |  28.5  |  $  |  28.5  |  $  |  17.9  |  $  |  17.9   \nOperating Income (Loss)  |  $  |  (1.8  |  )  |  $  |  (1.8  |  )  |  $  |  (1.4  |  )  |  $  |  0.5   \nNet Income (Loss)  |  $  |  (2.2  |  )  |  $  |  (2.2  |  )  |  $  |  (1.6  |  )  |  $  |  0.1   \nNet Income (Loss) per Share – Basic and Diluted  |  $  |  (0.08  |  )  |  $  |  (0.08  |  )  |  $  |  (0.06  |  )  |  $  |  0.00   \n  \nNine Months Ended  |  Nine Months Ended   \n---|---  \nSeptember 28, 2024 |  September 30, 2023  \nGAAP Results  |  Non-GAAP Results  |  GAAP Results  |  Non-GAAP Results   \nNet Revenues  |  $  |  52.7  |  $  |  52.7  |  $  |  39.8  |  $  |  39.8   \nOperating Loss  |  $  |  (9.5  |  )  |  $  |  (9.5  |  )  |  $  |  (11.3  |  )  |  $  |  (9.4  |  )   \nNet Loss  |  $  |  (7.0  |  )  |  $  |  (8.1  |  )  |  $  |  (10.3  |  )  |  $  |  (9.0  |  )   \nNet Loss per Share – Basic and Diluted  |  $  |  (0.26  |  )  |  $  |  (0.30  |  )  |  $  |  (0.40  |  )  |  $  |  (0.35  |  )   \nIntevac’s non-GAAP adjusted results exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: (i) restructuring charges and (ii) discontinued operations. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in the financial table included in this release. See also “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.   \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Summary**\n\nRevenues were $28.5 million, consisting of HDD upgrades, spares and service, as well as approximately $15 million of revenue related to the inventory agreement with a customer. Gross margin was 24.8%, compared to 39.1%, in the third quarter of 2023. The inventory revenues included a small amount of gross profit to cover the operating expenses associated with procuring and storing the inventory, and the impact of this profit along with certain other inventory adjustments collectively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 percentage points. Operating expenses were $8.8 million, compared to $8.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The operating loss was $1.8 million compared to $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nThe net loss for the quarter was $2.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. The non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net income of $0.1 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nOrder backlog was $44.4 million on September 28, 2024 compared to $42.5 million on June 29, 2024 and $46.5 million on September 30, 2023. Backlog at September 28, 2024 and June 29, 2024 did not include any 200 Lean HDD systems.

Gross margin was 31.9%, compared to 35.9% in the first nine months of 2023. The inventory revenues included a small amount of gross profit to cover the operating expenses associated with procuring and storing the inventory related to the cancelled order, and the impact of this profit along with certain other inventory adjustments collectively impacted year-to-date gross margin by approximately 13 percentage points. Operating expenses were $26.3 million, compared to $25.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The net loss was $7.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $10.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss was $8.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $9.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIntevac’s non-GAAP results exclude the impact, where applicable, of restructuring charges and discontinued operations. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the financial tables included in this release. \n\nManagement uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the Company’s operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Intevac believes these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the Company’s business from the same perspective as the Company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will discuss its financial results and outlook in a conference call today at 1:30 p.m. PST (4:30 p.m. EST).
