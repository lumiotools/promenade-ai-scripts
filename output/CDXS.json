(NASDAQ: CDXS), a leading provider of enzymatic solutions for efficient and scalable therapeutics manufacturing, today announced data from three presentations at the TIDES Europe annual meeting being held November 12-14, 2024, in Hamburg, Germany. The data demonstrate the Company’s rapid advancement of its Enzyme Catalyzed Oligonucleotide (ECO) Synthesis™ manufacturing platform and establish Codexis’ position at the forefront of enzymatic synthesis technology to enable to ongoing expansion of RNAi therapeutics.\n\n**Codexis Demonstrates First-ever Enzymatic Synthesis of Approved siRNA Therapeutic**\n\nDuring an oral Spotlight Presentation, Codexis unveiled the successful end-to-end enzymatic synthesis of an entire approved siRNA therapeutic asset, inclisiran. Codexis enzymatically synthesized the full-length sense and antisense strands of the molecule, including the enzymatic incorporation of a tissue-targeting moiety to the sense strand. To date, this process has only been completed utilizing phosphoramidite chemistry, a process that involves the use of harsh chemical conditions and vast amounts of toxic organic solvents. By contrast, Codexis’ ECO Synthesis manufacturing platform operates under milder, aqueous conditions, that improves product quality and dramatically decreases chemical waste production.\n\nIn addition to this fully enzymatic route of synthesis, the Company demonstrated similar outcomes utilizing three routes of enzymatic ligation to produce the siRNA therapeutic asset, combining oligonucleotide fragments made by sequential enzymatic synthesis and traditional phosphoramidite chemistry. Key data from the presentation include:\n\n  * Achieved incorporation efficiency of >98% during sequential enzymatic oligo synthesis\n  * Successfully attached the tri-GalNAc tissue-targeting moiety by enzymatic ligation\n  * Obtained full-length oligonucleotides of equal quality and yields, using ligation of short fragments made with enzymes or by traditional phosphoramidite chemistry \n\n\n\nNow that Codexis has successfully achieved this unprecedented milestone, the Company will continue to optimize its process for robustness, scaled-up quantities and improved purity with the goal of providing customers with siRNA material of comparable or better quality to phosphoramidite chemistry. The Company anticipates ramping up manufacturing of siRNA in quantities for preclinical testing following the successful build out of its ECO Synthesis Innovation Lab at the end of this year.\n\n**Codexis Double-stranded RNA Ligase Demonstrates Superior Performance to Wild-type Enzymes**\n\nTwo additional presentations focused on results of direct comparisons of Codexis’ engineered double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ligases and wild-type (WT) enzymes when used to combine short oligonucleotide fragments to synthesize full-length siRNA therapeutic compounds.\n\nIn a joint poster with Bachem, one of the world’s leading CDMOs in oligonucleotide manufacturing, the data provided compelling external validation of the superior performance of Codexis ligases over existing wild-type enzymes in use today. Codexis enzymes demonstrated superior performance over wild-type enzymes across both volumetric productivity and substrate versatility. These dsRNA ligases outperformed on multiple substrate designs and enabled a higher conversion rate of oligonucleotide fragments into siRNA at increased concentrations of raw materials.\n\nIn a separate TIDES Talk presentation, Codexis demonstrated improved performance of its dsRNA ligase over WT enzymes based on real customer case studies executed through the Company’s RNA Ligase Screening and Optimization Services, launched in May 2024. Codexis’ engineered ligases delivered robust, in-process performance, including higher substrate loading, faster reaction times and improved conversation at elevated temperatures. These data demonstrate the Company’s ability to accelerate delivery of lead ligase variants to customers and optimize process conditions for a customer’s specific asset.\n\nThe slide decks from both presentations as well as the joint poster with Bachem are now available in the Investor Relations section the Codexis corporate website, [www.codexis.com/investors](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZlMFPsmLgq1bt3x5zPLh8xY3eJvqz9EzWgW614K-mXDsAsedwG6uGnAAoQDiwRfpVeibqG4fVDnoOmTIecEc9JirpK1dKInFCnGqXzZp3Feh76-fwwaAcn3iOe21a2Dj \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nCodexis management will host a conference call beginning at 4:30 pm Eastern Time on Thursday, November 14, 2024, to discuss the data presented during the conference. The live call can be accessed by dialing 877-705-2976 (domestic) or 201-689-8798 (international).

A telephone replay of the call will be available for 48 hours by dialing 877-660-6853 (domestic) or 201-612-7415 (international), access ID #13726635.\n\n**About RNAi Therapeutics Manufacturing**\n\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) as a therapeutic modality has gained tremendous traction in recent years with the growing number of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and small interfering RNA (siRNA) candidates advancing in clinical studies. However, large-scale production of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics using traditional chemical synthesis faces complex challenges in nucleic acid quality and quantity, as well as overall economics. With over 450 RNAi therapies currently in clinical development, including more than 40 assets in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials targeting disease indications impacting millions of patients, RNAi therapeutic demand is projected to outpace current production capabilities by the end of the decade.\n\n**About the ECO Synthesis Manufacturing Platform**\n\nCodexis’ proprietary Enzyme Catalyzed Oligonucleotide (ECO) Synthesis™ manufacturing platform is being designed to address scalability and cost limitations by potentially enabling the commercial-scale manufacture of RNAi therapeutics through an enzymatic route. The Company presented groundbreaking data at the TIDES USA 2024 annual meeting demonstrating the enzymatic synthesis of a full-length sense strand of the oligonucleotide lumasiran, a commercially available siRNA therapeutic, as well as shorter sense strand fragments of a second siRNA therapeutic asset, givosiran. The data demonstrate that Codexis consistently achieved coupling efficiency greater than 98%, which is equivalent to what is seen with phosphoramidite chemistry; executed the enzymatic addition of a conjugation moiety to the lumasiran strand; and confirmed the lack of notable impurities typically observed in oligonucleotide synthesis via phosphoramidite chemistry.

(NASDAQ: CDXS), a leading provider of enzymatic solutions for efficient and scalable therapeutics manufacturing, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“Codexis had a strong third quarter, in which we surpassed product revenue goals, welcomed two new, highly experienced executives to our management team, and brought in $31 million via our existing ATM facility, extending our cash runway into 2027, past the point of profitability. By out-licensing our genomics enzymes portfolio to Alphazyme, we also reinforced our ability to focus on our key strategic priorities: the growth of our Pharmaceutical Manufacturing business and our ECO Synthesis™ manufacturing platform,” said Stephen Dilly, MBBS, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Codexis. “We are in a great position to close the fiscal year on a high note with three data presentations at the upcoming TIDES Europe congress, where we will showcase the real-world application of our ECO Synthesis™ platform and highlight concrete commercial interest. We also expect to announce our first technical collaboration with a major pharmaceutical partner by the end of this year. Combined with the increasing volume of inbound inquiries for our ECO Synthesis™ technology, we are well on our way to being the first company to capture significant value from the enzymatic synthesis of oligonucleotide therapeutics.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * In October 2024, Codexis announced an increase in its cash reserves through capital raises totaling $31 million via the Company’s existing at-the-market (ATM) facility. The expanded reserves allow the Company to self-fund into 2027, providing a clear path to positive cash flow, anticipated around the end of 2026. The continuous interest from existing shareholders serves as validation of the Company’s accelerated technical progress and will enable Codexis to invest in the right talent, technology and capabilities to continue executing on its strategy.\n  * In October 2024, Codexis announced the appointment of Georgia Erbez to Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Erbez is a seasoned financial executive who most recently served as Chief Operating Officer at Walking Fish Therapeutics. Prior to that, she served as the Chief Financial Officer of Harpoon Therapeutics. Ms. Erbez also held the role of Chief Business Officer and Chief Financial Officer at Zosano Pharma Corp., and has served as Chief Financial Officer for Revolution Medicines, Asterias Biotherapeutics and Raptor Pharmaceuticals. \n  * Codexis announced the appointment of Alison Moore, PhD, to the newly created role of Chief Technical Officer in October 2024. Dr. Moore is the former Chief Technical Officer of Allogene Therapeutics and joins the Codexis Management Team after serving for four years on the Company’s Board of Directors. Prior to Allogene, she spent a total of 20 years at Amgen, most recently as Senior Vice President, Process Development, and held roles in Supply Chain and Manufacturing. Dr. Moore also has experience at Genentech as a Director in Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, and in Regulatory Affairs. \n  * In October 2024, Codexis announced the Company licensed its genomics life science enzyme portfolio to Alphazyme, LLC, part of Maravai LifeSciences. The agreement includes licenses for the HiFi DNA Polymerase, HiTemp Reverse Transcriptase, HiRev Isothermal Polymerase and other enzymes that were in development directed towards genomics and diagnostics applications prior to the Company’s strategic shift announced in July 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, Codexis is eligible to receive sales-based royalties.\n  * In September 2024, Codexis participated in a presentation and panel discussion at the RNA Leaders USA Congress. The Company’s presentations focused on the use of its Enzyme Catalyzed Oligonucleotide (ECO) Synthesis™ manufacturing platform to leverage enzymes in driving the scalable and cost-effective manufacture of short inhibitory ribonucleic acid (siRNA) duplexes.\n  * In August 2024, Codexis announced the publication of its inaugural sustainability disclosures detailing the Company’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. To learn more about Codexis’ sustainability program or obtain a copy of the Company’s inaugural Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) index, please visit the [sustainability page on the Company’s website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=iS2SteOlpogpSu-Z2KUvabCAACYceS08pjku24HvZUnxoj_ZONi0rRD45h3AGxKx3sBcBdcnk82kuLUn0XqCFB0t2IIYWn1De0LumhOdnVVSOhGGCsfwp0NX54MdKs2C \"Opens in a new window\").\n  * Codexis announced in July 2024 that the Company had finalized a purchase agreement with Crosswalk Therapeutics for two gene therapy assets. Under the terms of the agreement, Crosswalk acquired the Company’s investigational Fabry and Pompe disease compounds, and Codexis is eligible to receive future development and commercial milestone payments in addition to a net sales-based royalty.\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Milestones for the Fourth Quarter 2024**\n\n  * Codexis expects to announce its first technical collaboration with the ECO Synthesis™ manufacturing platform by the end of 2024.\n  * The Company expects to complete the build-out of its ECO Synthesis™ Innovation Lab around the end of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter** **2024****Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenues were $12.8 million for third quarter 2024 compared to $9.3 million in third quarter 2023.
