We continue to work through our non-performing loans and believe we will be able to resolve the majority of them by mid-2025.”\n\n“The team has done an excellent job building on the Bank’s reputation as one of the premier Asian-centric financial institutions,” said Christina Kao, Chair of the Board of Directors. “Returning the Bank to growth has been a priority for the Board of Directors as we believe it will enhance long-term shareholder value.”\n\n(1) Reconciliations of the non–U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures included at the end of this press release.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income was $24.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $24.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The $580,000 increase was due to an increase in interest income of $1.5 million offset by an increase in interest expense of $959,000. The increase in interest income was due mostly to higher interest income on loans held for investment (“HFI”) of $2.0 million, partially offset by lower interest income on investment securities of $504,000. The increase in loan interest income was mostly due to higher average loans HFI of $54.4 million combined with a 9 basis point increase in the HFI loan yield. The decrease in investment income was attributed to lower average balances and a lower portfolio yield as proceeds from maturing short-term commercial paper were invested into loans and interest-earning cash. The increase in interest expense was due to higher average interest-bearing deposits of $42.3 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNet interest margin (“NIM”) was 2.68% for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 1 basis point from 2.67% for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was due to a 5 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 3 basis point increase in the overall cost of funds. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 5.94% for the third quarter of 2024 from 5.89% for the second quarter of 2024 due mainly to a 9 basis point increase in the yield on average loans HFI to 6.13% for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in the loan yield was largely attributed to nonaccrual loan activity in the current and prior quarter, including both the recapture of interest income for fully paid off nonaccrual loans and reversals of interest income for loans migrating to nonaccrual status. Such activity increased the third quarter loan yield by 1 basis point and decreased the second quarter loan yield by 7 basis points. Average loans represented 84% of average interest-earning assets in the third quarter of 2024, unchanged from the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe overall cost of funds increased to 3.57% in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.54% in the second quarter of 2024 due to a higher average cost of interest-bearing deposits in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024. The overall funding mix remained relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2024 as the ratio of average noninterest-bearing deposits to average total funding sources remained relatively unchanged at 16% for the third and second quarters of 2024. The all-in spot rate for total deposits was 3.53% at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Provision for Credit Losses**\n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $557,000 for the second quarter of 2024. The third quarter provision took into consideration factors including changes in the loan portfolio mix, higher specific reserves, the outlook for economic conditions and market interest rates, and credit quality metrics, including higher nonperforming, special mention and substandard loans at the end of the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.7 million, an increase of $2.3 million from $3.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. This increase was mostly due to a $2.8 million recovery of a fully charged off loan, which had been acquired in a bank acquisition (included in other income), partially offset by lower net gain on other real estate owned (\"OREO\") of $292,000. \n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $17.4 million, an increase of $297,000 from $17.1 million for the second quarter of 2024. This increase was due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense of $475,000 due in part to higher loan production and higher other expenses of $304,000 due to higher loan related expense. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance and regulatory assessments of $323,000 and lower legal and professional expenses of $302,000, the latter being due to reimbursed legal costs from nonaccrual loan payoffs. The annualized noninterest expenses to average assets ratio was 1.78% for the third quarter of 2024, down from 1.79% for the second quarter of 2024. The efficiency ratio was 57.51% for the third quarter of 2024, down from 62.38% for the second quarter of 2024 due mostly to higher noninterest income.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe effective tax rate was 26.9% for the third quarter of 2024 and 25.9% for the second quarter of 2024. The effective tax rate for 2024 is estimated to range between 26.0% and 28.0%.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, total assets were $4.0 billion, a $122.3 million increase compared to June 30, 2024, and a $78.9 million decrease compared to September 30, 2023.\n\n**Loan and Securities Portfolio**\n\nLoans HFI totaled $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $44.2 million compared to June 30, 2024 and a $29.1 million decrease compared to September 30, 2023. The increase from June 30, 2024 was primarily due to a $62.5 million increase in commercial real estate (\"CRE\") loans, a $5.6 million increase in single-family residential (\"SFR\") mortgages and a $2.2 million increase in commercial and industrial (\"C&I\") loans, partially offset by a $22.3 million decrease in construction and land development (\"C&D\") loans and a $2.2 million decrease in Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") loans. The loan to deposit ratio was 98.6% at September 30, 2024, compared to 99.4% at June 30, 2024 and 97.6% at September 30, 2023. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, available-for-sale securities totaled $305.7 million, a decrease of $19.9 million from June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, net unrealized losses totaled $23.2 million, a $6.9 million decrease due to decreases in market interest rates, when compared to net unrealized losses as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nTotal deposits were $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, a $68.6 million increase compared to June 30, 2024 and a $61.9 million decrease compared to September 30, 2023. The increase during the third quarter of 2024 was due to an increase in interest-bearing deposits, while noninterest-bearing deposits remained relatively stable at $543.6 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $543.0 million as of June 30, 2024. The increase in interest-bearing deposits included an increase in time deposits of $49.6 million and an increase in non-maturity deposits of $18.3 million. The increase in time deposits included a $26.6 million increase in wholesale deposits (brokered deposits, collateralized State of California certificates of deposit and deposits acquired through internet listing services). Wholesale deposits totaled $147.3 million at September 30, 2024, and $120.7 million at June 30, 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 17.6% of total deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 18.0% at June 30, 2024.\n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nNonperforming assets totaled $60.7 million, or 1.52% of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to $54.6 million, or 1.41% of total assets, at June 30, 2024. The $6.1 million increase in nonperforming assets was mostly due to two loans that migrated to nonaccrual totaling $13.3 million and consisted of a C&D loan and a CRE loan, offset by $6.1 million in payoffs with no losses and $1.2 million in partial charge-offs of nonaccrual loans.\n\nSpecial mention loans totaled $77.5 million, or 2.51% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $19.5 million, or 0.64% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. The $58.0 million increase was primarily due to one $43.6 million C&D loan for a completed hotel construction project, CRE loans totaling $25.2 million and C&I loans totaling $1.2 million. The increase was partially offset by one $11.7 million C&D loan, which migrated from special mention to substandard during the third quarter of 2024. All special mention loans, including the $11.7 million C&D loan which migrated to substandard rating, are all paying current.\n\nSubstandard loans totaled $79.8 million, or 2.58% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $63.1 million, or 2.07% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. The $16.8 million increase was primarily due to downgrades of two C&D loans totaling $21.7 million and one $3.3 million CRE loan, offset by loan payoffs of $6.7 million and charge-offs of $1.2 million. Of the substandard loans at September 30, 2024, there are $19.2 million which are paying current.\n\n30-89 day delinquent loans, excluding nonperforming loans, decreased $645,000 to $10.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $11.3 million as of June 30, 2024. The decrease in past due loans was mostly due to 12 loans totaling $4.7 million that returned to current status and other decreases totaling $784,000, partially offset by new delinquent loans totaling $4.9 million, of which $4.1 million were 30 days past due.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses totaled $44.5 million and was comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $43.7 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $779,000 (included in “Accrued interest and other liabilities”). This compares to the allowance for credit losses of $42.4 million comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $41.7 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $624,000 at June 30, 2024. The $2.1 million increase in the allowance for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was due to a $3.3 million provision for credit losses, including higher specific reserves of $2.5 million, offset by net charge-offs of $1.2 million. The increase in specific reserves and charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the estimated fair value of collateral dependent loans, including estimated selling costs. Charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were related to one C&D loan and one CRE loan, which were written-down to their estimated fair value. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans HFI was 1.41% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.37% at June 30, 2024. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 72% at September 30, 2024, a decrease from 76% at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was due in part to an increase in individually evaluated loans, which required no allowance for loan losses.\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024** | **For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**_(dollars in thousands)_** | **Allowance for loan losses** | **Reserve for unfunded loan commitments** | **Allowance for credit losses** | **Allowance for loan losses** | **Reserve for unfunded loan commitments** | **Allowance for credit losses**  \nBeginning balance | $ | 41,741 | $ | 624 | $ | 42,365 | $ | 41,903 | $ | 640 | $ | 42,543  \nProvision for credit losses | 3,145 | 155 | 3,300 | 3,718 | 139 | 3,857  \nLess loans charged-off | (1,210 | ) | — | (1,210 | ) | (1,991 | ) | — | (1,991 | )  \nRecoveries on loans charged-off | 9 | — | 9 | 55 | — | 55  \nEnding balance | $ | 43,685 | $ | 779 | $ | 44,464 | $ | 43,685 | $ | 779 | $ | 44,464  \n  \n**Shareholders' Equity**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, total shareholders' equity was $509.7 million, a $1.6 million decrease compared to June 30, 2024, and a $7.2 million increase compared to September 30, 2023. The decrease in shareholders' equity for the third quarter of 2024 was due to common stock repurchases of $11.0 million and common stock cash dividends paid of $2.9 million, offset by net income of $7.0 million, lower net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities of $4.8 million and equity compensation activity of $528,000. Book value per share and tangible book value per share(1) increased to $28.81 and $24.64 at September 30, 2024, up from $28.12 and $24.06 at June 30, 2024.\n\nOn February 29, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock.
