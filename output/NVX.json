The material will be supplied to PowerCo over a five-year term starting in 2027.\n\nEstablished by Volkswagen in 2022, PowerCo is committed to ramp-up global battery cell production. PowerCo oversees international factory operations, advances in cell technology, and vertical integration of the battery value chain. PowerCo has identified three gigafactory locations – Salzgitter in Germany, Valencia in Spain, and St. Thomas in Canada - with a combined capacity of up to 200 GWh/year. NOVONIX and PowerCo previously announced the signing of a non-exclusive Testing and Development Agreement in March 2024.\n\nNOVONIX’s Riverside facility is poised to become the first large-scale production site dedicated to high-performance synthetic graphite for the battery sector in North America and is slated to begin commercial production in 2025, with plans to grow output to 20,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) to meet current customer commitments. Previously, the Company announced the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (“MESC”) awarded the Company a US$100 million grant and was selected for a US$103 million investment tax credit towards the funding of the Riverside facility.\n\nThe Company is also progressing plans to build a second production facility, in the southeastern United States, that will have an initial capacity of 30,000 tpa and plans to expand that facility to 75,000 tpa. NOVONIX remains in discussions with the DOE Loan Program Office (“LPO”) for an Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Program loan to support the construction of this new production facility. NOVONIX’s current plans call for total production to increase to at least 150,000 tpa of synthetic graphite material to accommodate anticipated customer demand.\n\n**Key Deal Terms**\n\n  * Offtake commitment is for a minimum of 32,000 tonnes over the five-year term of the agreement.\n  * Products will be priced under a pricing structure that has been agreed between the parties.\n  * The start of commercial supply is targeted to commence in 2027, subject to NOVONIX achieving agreed upon milestones regarding final mass production qualification and satisfying certain compliance criteria. NOVONIX must also secure financing commitments for the production facilities that will supply PowerCo product. If these milestones or requirements have not been satisfied, then PowerCo may terminate the agreement.\n\n\n\n_This announcement has been authorized for release by NOVONIX Chairman, Admiral Robert J.

To support their participation in the project, NOVONIX Battery Technology Solutions Inc., a Canadian division of NOVONIX, is receiving advisory services and up to CAD $127,928 in funding from the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (“NRC IRAP”), while ICoNiChem is receiving support through Innovate UK. The 2-year project, with a total budget of CAD $515,686 between NOVONIX and ICoNiChem, aims to further improve the sustainability of the NOVONIX all-dry, zero-waste technology by incorporating recycled metal feedstock, such as cobalt and nickel carbonates and oxides, into the process.\n\nDr. Chris Burns, CEO of NOVONIX said, “NOVONIX will utilize its patented all-dry, zero-waste synthesis process to synthesize, test, and analyze cathode active materials that will incorporate ICoNiChem’s recycled cobalt and nickel. Our involvement reflects our continued commitment to advancing sustainable solutions, reducing cathode processing cost, and strengthening the critical mineral supply chain across North America, the UK, and beyond.”\n\nBerk Sengul, Managing Director of ICoNiChem said “This is a fantastic opportunity to work with a world class company like NOVONIX to develop a UK supply chain for nickel-based cathode active materials. The project will strengthen ICoNiChem’s position as a global player in cobalt and nickel materials”\n\nICoNiChem will provide various recycled materials, including cobalt and nickel carbonates or oxides, throughout the project to compare and demonstrate optimal performance in cathode powders. The project will utilize NOVONIX’s cathode pilot line, as well as other services from NOVONIX Battery Technology Solutions, to support the characterization of project materials including their physical and electrochemical performance. Materials will be built into full scale pouch cells to benchmark performance relative to other leading cathode materials.\n\nUpon successful completion of milestones, NOVONIX may enter into commercial agreements for ICoNiChem products with the goal of integrating recycled feed into its CAM production processes moving forward.\n\nThis announcement has been authorized for release by NOVONIX Chairman, Admiral Robert J. Natter, USN Ret.\n\n**About NOVONIX All-Dry, Zero-Waste, Cathode Pilot Line** In July 2023, NOVONIX commissioned its all-dry, zero-waste cathode pilot line and announced its production of material that matched the performance of leading cathode materials from existing suppliers in full-cell testing. Since then, the Company has shared the [results](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7gc6Thyd1XSGWr-OqJ0_DYJ_lvzl5CGy3kHgoDdjtA92miMVRiVpQ0CkQTWXrwt3HNamzgo5uM_bfcJzgNmUEvwVJFq6RGqC8T3JAPDsE4V-8G8e0fShcgTcgYxEBO6JmhVYdbs0a-4mx8RDkpRwMEpScXAjyESwk1dnRRGAaoaCBs2hXarNIzZn4cShHd_i_m4w6JOZy19kU46G06T2Zg==) of an independent engineering study by Hatch Ltd. that shows the potentially significant cost savings and waste reduction of NOVONIX’s cathode synthesis process compared to the conventional wet process.\n\nNOVONIX was recently granted a [patent](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y4m677KC-XTM1mKC73Y1wIcbciFn-RRj4T_5bK_pBym2awCNYoLCxWfw_c-QIYugmfRreATR5s_JDCnUHgwpEjpo4hcC-A38cr0lcJ6qPPBCc-hfZuLiCjwbiFu3Ag0EsIMZq8Lrx8lRq5tA9SVgZuBgrlEBXZRd8Vqm12gxS7cgC_Orknb9Mqnej9FFbGnvQ9MBp80w28SlnkQRVT8Saw==) for its all-dry, zero-waste cathode synthesis technology in Japan, a key market for the production and use of CAM. The Company has continued to produce various grades of mid- and high-nickel cathode material to specifications of potential commercialization partners and began sampling these pilot scale materials. A white paper was recently published to highlight the performance of its mid-nickel materials.\n\n**About NOVONIX** NOVONIX is a leading battery technology company revolutionizing the global lithium-ion battery industry with innovative, sustainable technologies, high-performance materials, and more efficient production methods. The Company manufactures industry-leading battery cell testing equipment, is growing its high-performance synthetic graphite anode material manufacturing operations, and has developed an all-dry, zero-waste cathode synthesis process. Through advanced R&D capabilities, proprietary technology, and strategic partnerships, NOVONIX has gained a prominent position in the electric vehicle and energy storage systems battery industry and is powering a cleaner energy future.\n\nTo learn more, visit us at [_www.novonixgroup.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cRNKLRMzb9W4CveyHqEJYzBGTz3gINaPYg9iY9JDIZrAyWTsCC2ZCdt-gJqEWmgchul2hNDAUInTi9IPF0JfqomVfwdgndeqXl3n0sc-8fs=) or on [_LinkedIn_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6FKeyU3VdE60fWZr-_dPHYkxeNbSJlCm_4F04wBV8xY72R2Yurt0j6nU8EoU-m1PPc1vN0bsGR9EMZutC1ySYidSdjMnu6DwZ2qbaT7ST_8=) and [X](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Uki7B_m4yew3NCaM1gMb5wVDKwnAkRAl-LBNaU9WJ7L9MyvBmV4uHZ_6rHsLd5q1qa7czQ1wkZbn64rm_4CHrg==). \n\n**About ICoNiChem** Born out of The Shepherd Chemical Company, ICoNiChem Widnes Ltd was created by an amicable divestiture from Shepherd in August 2016 by GIL (Grove Investments Ltd). On 9th December 2020 the shareholders of ICoNiChem Group Limited agreed to accept an unsolicited offer for the sale of the entire share capital of ICoNiChem Group Limited to Cengiz Holding in Turkey. The site has produced inorganic salts of Cobalt and Nickel in the North West of England uninterrupted for over 40 years.\n\nThe ICoNiChem mission is to grow the specialty chemical business based on quality and manufacturing excellence using 100% ethically sourced feedstocks including recycled materials from Li-ion batteries.
