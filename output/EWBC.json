(“East West” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: EWBC), parent company of East West Bank, reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. First quarter 2024 net income was $285 million, or $2.03 per diluted share. Excluding a $10 million pre-tax Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) Special Assessment-related charge (the “FDIC charge”)1, adjusted diluted earnings per share2 for the quarter were $2.08, up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2023. Total deposits reached a record $58.6 billion as of March 31, 2024. Return on average common equity was 16%, return on average tangible common equity3 was 18%, and book value per share grew 13% year-over-year. \n\n“This quarter we grew deposits by $2.5 billion to a new record level and optimized funding to support prudent asset growth,” said Dominic Ng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “East West grew adjusted diluted earnings per share3% and tangible book value per share3 2% quarter-over-quarter. With continued confidence in our earnings generation, stable credit quality, and capital strength, we were pleased to repurchase 1.2 million shares of common stock,” continued Ng. “Through the strength of our diversified business model, conservatively managed balance sheet, and industry-leading profitability, East West remains well-positioned to outperform the industry in 2024 and beyond.” \n\n** FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS **\n\nThree Months Ended  |  Quarter-over-Quarter Change   \n---|---  \n_($ in millions, except per share data)_ |  March 31, 2024  |  December 31, 2023  |  $  |  %   \nRevenue  |  $644  |  $655  |  $(11)  |  (2)%   \nPre-tax, Pre-provision Income4 |  397  |  364  |  33  |  9   \nNet Income  |  285  |  239  |  46  |  19   \nDiluted Earnings per Share  |  $2.03  |  $1.69  |  $0.34  |  20%   \nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share2 |  $2.08  |  $2.02  |  $0.06  |  3%   \nBook Value per Share  |  $50.48  |  $49.64  |  $0.84  |  2%   \nTangible Book Value per Share3 |  $47.09  |  $46.27  |  $0.82  |  2%   \nReturn on Average Common Equity  |  16.40%  |  14.16%  |  224 bps  |  —   \nReturn on Average Tangible Common Equity3 |  17.60%  |  15.26%  |  234 bps  |  —   \nTotal Assets  |  $70,876  |  $69,613  |  $1,263  |  2%   \n  \n1 |  In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special deposit insurance assessment to recover estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following the receiverships of failed institutions in the spring of 2023. In February 2024, the FDIC increased the estimated losses by $4.1 billion to $20.4 billion. As losses to the DIF are estimates, the FDIC may periodically adjust the amount, resulting in longer or shorter assessment periods, and/or additional special assessments.   \n---|---  \n2 |  Adjusted diluted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure.

First quarter 2024 average interest-earning assets of $68.1 billion were up $2.6 billion, or 4%, from $65.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting increases of $1.4 billion in average cash and deposits with banks, $0.7 billion in average loans outstanding, and $0.6 billion in average AFS debt securities holdings. \n\n\n  * **Loans** – Total loans were $52.0 billion as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of $0.2 billion from $52.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. Year-over-year, total loans were up $3.1 billion, or 6%, from $48.9 billion as of March 31, 2023. First quarter 2024 average loans of $51.9 billion grew $0.7 billion, or 1%, from the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by growth across our single-family residential and C&I loan portfolios. \n\n\n  * **Deposits** – Total deposits were $58.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 4%, from $56.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting an increase in customer deposits related to a successful branch-based CD campaign for the Lunar New Year. Noninterest-bearing deposits made up 25% of our total deposits as of March 31, 2024, down from 28% as of December 31, 2023. Year-over-year, total deposits increased $3.8 billion from $54.7 billion as of March 31, 2023. First quarter 2024 average deposits of $57.4 billion increased $2.0 billion from the fourth quarter of 2023, with growth in average time, money market, and interest-bearing checking deposits offset by declines in other categories. \n\n\n  * **Borrowings** – Total borrowings and long-term debt were $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of $1.1 billion, or 24%, from $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by the payoff of $4.5 billion in Bank Term Funding Program borrowings and a $117 million decrease in long-term debt and finance lease liabilities due to the redemption of East West Capital Trust securities, partially offset by a $3.5 billion increase in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. \n\n\n  * **Capital** – As of March 31, 2024, stockholders’ equity was $7.0 billion, up 1% quarter-over-quarter. The stockholders’ equity to asset ratio was 9.91% as of March 31, 2024, compared with 9.98% as of December 31, 2023. Book value per share was $50.48 as of March 31, 2024, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 13% year-over-year. As of March 31, 2024, tangible book value per share5 was $47.09, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year. The tangible common equity ratio5 was 9.31%, compared with 9.37% as of December 31, 2023. All of East West’s regulatory capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements for well-capitalized institutions, and well above regional bank averages. The common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio increased to 13.53%, and the total risk-based capital ratio increased by eight basis points to 14.84%, as of March 31, 2024. \n\n\n\n**OPERATING RESULTS**\n\n**First Quarter Earnings** – First quarter 2024 net income was $285 million, and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) were $2.03. Excluding $10 million pre-tax for the FDIC charge in the first quarter of 2024 and a $70 million pre-tax FDIC charge and $3 million of losses on an AFS debt security in the fourth quarter of 2023, adjusted net income6 was $292 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.08, up 2% and 3% quarter-over-quarter, respectively. \n\n5 |  Tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in Table 11.   \n---|---  \n6 |  Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure. See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in Table 12.   \n  \n** First Quarter 2024 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2023 **\n\n**_Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin_ **\n\nNet interest income totaled $565 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 2% from $575 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest margin (“NIM”) was 3.34%, a 14 basis point decline from the fourth quarter. \n\n  * NIM declined primarily due to a higher cost of interest-bearing deposits and continued deposit mix shift, partly offset by higher asset yields and balances. \n  * The average loan yield was 6.71%, up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter. The average interest-earning asset yield was 6.04%, up four basis points from the fourth quarter. \n  * The average cost of funds was 2.97%, up 23 basis points from the fourth quarter. The average cost of deposits was 2.84%, up 24 basis points from the fourth quarter. \n\n\n\n**_Noninterest Income_ **\n\nNoninterest income totaled $79 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $1 million, or 1%, from $80 million in the fourth quarter. Mark-to-market and credit valuation adjustments on customer and other derivatives was a gain of $1 million in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $7 million in the fourth quarter. Other investment income increased $1 million quarter-over-quarter. \n\n  * Fee income7 of $71 million was down $2 million, or 3%, from $73 million in the fourth quarter. \n  * Deposit fees, lending fees, and wealth management fees each increased by approximately $1 million quarter-over-quarter. \n  * The above increases were offset by a $3 million decrease in customer derivative revenue, reflecting lower customer activity. \n  * Foreign exchange income decreased $2 million in the first quarter, primarily reflecting an unfavorable change in mark-to-market adjustments on FX positions. \n\n\n\n**_Noninterest Expense_ **\n\nNoninterest expense totaled $247 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $44 million, or 15% from $290 million in the fourth quarter, which includes $10 million and $70 million, respectively, for the FDIC charge.First quarter noninterest expense consisted of $223 million of adjusted noninterest expense8, and $13 million in amortization expenses related to tax credit and other investments. \n\n  * Adjusted noninterest expense of $223 million increased nearly $8 million, or 4%, from $215 million in the fourth quarter. This was driven primarily by a seasonal first quarter $11 million increase in compensation and employee benefits, reflecting higher payroll taxes and an increase in compensation, partly offset by a $5 million decrease in other operating expense, primarily reflecting lower legal expense and realized credit card fraud losses in the first quarter. \n  * Amortization of tax credit and other investments was $13 million in the first quarter, up $9 million from the fourth quarter. The increase was due to the sale of a tax credit investment and the timing of certain renewable energy tax credit investments that were not placed into service in the fourth quarter. \n  * The efficiency ratio was 38.3% in the first quarter, compared with 44.4% in the fourth quarter and the adjusted efficiency ratio8 was 34.7% in the first quarter, compared with 33.1% in the fourth quarter. \n\n\n\n**TAX RELATED ITEMS**\n\nFirst quarter 2024 income tax expense was $87 million, and the effective tax rate was 23.4%, compared with income tax expense of $88 million and 27.0% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The lower effective tax rate in the first quarter was primarily due to the sale of a tax credit investment in the fourth quarter and the timing of certain renewable energy tax credit investments that are expected to be placed into service in 2024. \n\n7 |  Fee income includes deposit account and lending fees, foreign exchange income, wealth management fees, and customer derivative revenue. Refer to Table 3 for additional fee and noninterest income information.   \n---|---  \n8 |  Adjusted noninterest expense and adjusted efficiency ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in Table 10.   \n  \n**ASSET QUALITY**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the credit quality of our loan portfolio remained solid. \n\n  * The criticized loans ratio increased 43 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 2.30% of loans held-for-investment (“HFI”) as of March 31, 2024, compared with 1.87% as of December 31, 2023. Criticized loans increased $217 million quarter-over-quarter to $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2024. The special mention loans ratio increased 28 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 1.05% of loans HFI as of March 31, 2024, compared with 0.77% as of December 31, 2023, and the classified loans ratio increased 15 basis points to 1.25%. \n  * Nonperforming assets increased $51 million to $165 million as of March 31, 2024, from $114 million as of December 31, 2023. The nonperforming assets ratio was 0.23% of total assets as of March 31, 2024, compared with 0.16% of total assets as of December 31, 2023. The quarter-over-quarter change reflects increases across commercial real estate, consumer, and C&I asset types. \n  * First quarter 2024 net charge-offs were $23 million, or annualized 0.17% of average loans HFI, compared with $20 million, or annualized 0.15% of average loans HFI, for the fourth quarter of 2023. \n  * The allowance for loan losses increased to $670 million, or 1.29% of loans HFI, as of March 31, 2024, compared with $669 million, or 1.28% of loans HFI, as of December 31, 2023. \n  * First quarter 2024 provision for credit losses was $25 million, compared with $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\n**CAPITAL STRENGTH**\n\nCapital levels for East West remained strong as of March 31, 2024. The following table presents capital metrics as of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023. \n\n**EWBC Capital**  \n---  \n_($ in millions)_ |  **March 31, 2024(a) ** |  **December 31, 2023(a) ** |  **March 31, 2023(a) **  \nRisk-Weighted Assets (“RWA”) (b) |  $53,448  |  $53,663  |  $50,229   \nRisk-based capital ratios:   \nCET1 capital ratio  |  13.53%  |  13.31%  |  13.06%   \nTier 1 capital ratio  |  13.53%  |  13.31%  |  13.06%   \nTotal capital ratio  |  14.84%  |  14.76%  |  14.50%   \nLeverage ratio  |  10.05%  |  10.21%  |  10.02%   \nTangible common equity ratio (c) |  9.31%  |  9.37%  |  8.74%   \n  \n(a) |  The Company has elected to use the 2020 Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) transition provision in the calculation of its March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023 regulatory capital ratios. The Company’s March 31, 2024 regulatory capital ratios and RWA are preliminary.   \n---|---  \n(b) |  Under regulatory guidelines, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories based on the nature of the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar value in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWA.   \n(c) |  Tangible common equity ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in Table 11.   \n  \n**DIVIDEND PAYOUT AND CAPITAL ACTIONS**\n\nEast West’s Board of Directors has declared second quarter 2024 dividends for the Company’s common stock.
