          "content": "IPG PHOTONICS ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nFocusing on Execution and Future Growth Opportunities\nDelivered Results At the High End of Guidance\nMARLBOROUGH, Mass. – October 29, 2024 - IPG Photonics Corporation (NASDAQ: IPGP) today reported financial\nresults for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In millions, except per share data and\npercentages) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 233.1 $ 301.4 (23) % $ 742.8 $ 988.5 (25) %\nGross margin 23.2 % 44.1 % 33.4 % 43.2 %\nOperating (loss) income $ (253.3) $ 55.7 NM $ (222.2) $ 203.2 NM\nOperating margin (108.7) % 18.5 % (29.9) % 20.6 %\nNet (loss) income attributable to IPG\nPhotonics Corporation $ (233.6) $ 55.0 NM $ (189.3) $ 177.5 NM\n(Loss) earnings per diluted share (1) $ (5.33) $ 1.16 NM $ (4.22) $ 3.73 NM\n(1) Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to supplemental schedule of non-\nGAAP measures for reconciliation details.\nNM - not meaningful.\nManagement Comments\n\"IPG has made important progress strategically and operationally in the last several months,” said Dr. Mark Gitin, IPG\nPhotonics’ Chief Executive Officer. “Our third-quarter results were at the high end of our guidance when adjusted for the\ndivested revenue. We completed our exit from Russia and are strengthening our position in fast-growing high-precision laser\ncleaning applications with the announced acquisition of cleanLASER. These moves, along with progress in our innovation\npipeline and actions underway to gain efficiencies across our business, underscore that we are controlling what we can control\nas we position for demand recovery.”\nFinancial Highlights\nThird quarter revenue of $233 million decreased 23% year over year due to lower demand in industrial and e-mobility markets.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates did not have a material impact on revenue. Materials processing sales accounted for 89% of\ntotal revenue and decreased 22% year over year, primarily due to lower sales in cutting applications. Other sales decreased 28%\nyear over year due to lower revenue in medical and advanced applications. Emerging growth products sales accounted for 45%\nof total revenue, a slight decrease from 46% in the prior quarter due to lower revenue for high power pulsed lasers and medical\nproducts. By region, sales decreased 20% in North America, 27% in China, 29% in Europe and 8% in Japan on a year-over-\nyear basis.\nGross margin of 23.2% decreased significantly year over year due to increased inventory provision and reduced absorption of\nmanufacturing expenses, partially offset by lower tariffs and shipping costs. The inventory provision included $30 million\nrelated to a change in estimate of recoverability due to the current demand environment, which reduced gross margin by 12.8%,\nand diluted EPS by $0.49. Excluding this inventory provision results in an adjusted gross margin of 36.0%. Loss per diluted\nshare (EPS) of $5.33 included loss on divestiture of our Russian operations which decreased operating income by $198 million\nand asset impairment charges of $27 million. These items decreased diluted EPS by $5.16 in the third quarter. Foreign\nexchange transaction loss decreased operating income by $1 million and earnings per share by $0.02. Excluding these items\n1\nresults in an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.29 (1) in the third quarter. During the third quarter, IPG generated $66 million in cash\nfrom operations and spent $23 million on capital expenditures and $74 million on share repurchases.\nBusiness Outlook and Financial Guidance\n“We continue to believe we are bouncing along the bottom of a muted demand environment, which is supported by a book-to-\nbill of one for the third quarter. IPG’s strong technology portfolio and expertise across lasers positions us well in new growth\nareas where fiber lasers can replace incumbent technologies and differentiates us from competition,\" concluded Dr. Gitin.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, IPG expects revenue of $210 million to $240 million, gross margin between 35% and 38%, and\noperating expenses of $78 million to $80 million. The Company expects the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%,\nincluding certain discrete items. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.05 to $0.35. This\nguidance excludes Russian operations which were sold in the third quarter.\nAs discussed in more detail in the \"Safe Harbor\" passage of this news release, actual results may differ from this guidance due\nto various factors including, but not limited to, trade policy changes and trade restrictions, product demand, order cancellations\nand delays, competition, tariffs, currency fluctuations and general economic conditions. This guidance is based upon current\nmarket conditions and expectations, and is subject to the risks outlined in the Company's reports filed with the SEC, and\nassumes exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar of euro 0.90, Japanese yen 143 and Chinese yuan 7.01, respectively.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nAdditional supplemental financial information is provided in the unaudited Financial Data Workbook and Third Quarter 2024\nEarnings Call Presentation available on the investor relations section of the Company's website at investor.ipgphotonics.com.\nConference Call Reminder\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, October 29, 2024 at 10:00 am ET.

Such non-GAAP financial measures should not\nbe considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial\nmeasure presented by the Company.\nWe define adjusted gross profit as gross profit as reported, adjusted for non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual changes, including\na one-time inventory provision related to a change in estimate of recoverability due to the current demand environment.\nWe define adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenue.\nWe define adjusted net income as net income as reported, adjusted for non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual changes, including\none-time charges incurred in connection with the disposition of our Russian operations, impairment of long-lived assets, loss on\nforeign currency exchange, tax impacts and a one-time adjustment to inventory provision related to a change in estimate of\nrecoverability due to the current demand environment, and other adjustments that the Company believes appropriate.\nWe define adjusted EPS as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period\noperating performance. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to\nunderstand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and\nother items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more\ndifficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts.\nIn addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our\nfinancial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors. However, these non-\nGAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that these non-GAAP financial measures may be different\nfrom non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Management may, however, utilize other measures to illustrate\nperformance in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly\ncomparable GAAP measures has been provided below. These non-GAAP measures exclude (a) a one-time adjustment to our\ninventory provision related to a change in estimate of recoverability due to the current demand environment, (b) one-time\nadjustments relating to the net loss from divestiture and sale of assets incurred in the disposition of our Russian operations in\nthe third quarter of 2024and (c) impairment of long lived assets related to our Belarusian operations.\n9\nIPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION\nSUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED)\nThree Months\nEnded September\n30,\n2024\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nGross profit $ 54,089\nGross margin 23.2 %\nAdd: Inventory provision 29,884\nAdjusted gross profit $ 83,973\nAdjusted gross margin 36.0 %\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024\n(In thousands, except per share data) Before Tax Tax Impact After Tax Per Diluted Share\nNet (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics\nCorporation and diluted EPS $ (233,594) $ (5.33)\nAdjustments to reconcile to adjusted net income:\nInventory provision $ 29,884 $ (8,407) 21,477 0.49\nLong-lived asset impairment 26,566 — 26,566 0.61\nLoss on divestiture 197,651 1,824 199,475 4.55\nLoss on foreign exchange 1,148 (190) 958 0.02\nDiscrete tax impacts (1,981) (1,981) (0.05)\nTotal adjustments $ 255,249 $ (8,754) $ 246,495 $ 5.62\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS $ 12,901 $ 0.29\n10"

          "content": "IPG PHOTONICS ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nFocusing on Execution and Future Growth Opportunities\nDelivered Results At the High End of Guidance\nMARLBOROUGH, Mass. – October 29, 2024 - IPG Photonics Corporation (NASDAQ: IPGP) today reported financial\nresults for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In millions, except per share data and\npercentages) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 233.1 $ 301.4 (23) % $ 742.8 $ 988.5 (25) %\nGross margin 23.2 % 44.1 % 33.4 % 43.2 %\nOperating (loss) income $ (253.3) $ 55.7 NM $ (222.2) $ 203.2 NM\nOperating margin (108.7) % 18.5 % (29.9) % 20.6 %\nNet (loss) income attributable to IPG\nPhotonics Corporation $ (233.6) $ 55.0 NM $ (189.3) $ 177.5 NM\n(Loss) earnings per diluted share (1) $ (5.33) $ 1.16 NM $ (4.22) $ 3.73 NM\n(1) Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to supplemental schedule of non-\nGAAP measures for reconciliation details.\nNM - not meaningful.\nManagement Comments\n\"IPG has made important progress strategically and operationally in the last several months,” said Dr. Mark Gitin, IPG\nPhotonics’ Chief Executive Officer. “Our third-quarter results were at the high end of our guidance when adjusted for the\ndivested revenue. We completed our exit from Russia and are strengthening our position in fast-growing high-precision laser\ncleaning applications with the announced acquisition of cleanLASER. These moves, along with progress in our innovation\npipeline and actions underway to gain efficiencies across our business, underscore that we are controlling what we can control\nas we position for demand recovery.”\nFinancial Highlights\nThird quarter revenue of $233 million decreased 23% year over year due to lower demand in industrial and e-mobility markets.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates did not have a material impact on revenue. Materials processing sales accounted for 89% of\ntotal revenue and decreased 22% year over year, primarily due to lower sales in cutting applications. Other sales decreased 28%\nyear over year due to lower revenue in medical and advanced applications. Emerging growth products sales accounted for 45%\nof total revenue, a slight decrease from 46% in the prior quarter due to lower revenue for high power pulsed lasers and medical\nproducts. By region, sales decreased 20% in North America, 27% in China, 29% in Europe and 8% in Japan on a year-over-\nyear basis.\nGross margin of 23.2% decreased significantly year over year due to increased inventory provision and reduced absorption of\nmanufacturing expenses, partially offset by lower tariffs and shipping costs. The inventory provision included $30 million\nrelated to a change in estimate of recoverability due to the current demand environment, which reduced gross margin by 12.8%,\nand diluted EPS by $0.49. Excluding this inventory provision results in an adjusted gross margin of 36.0%. Loss per diluted\nshare (EPS) of $5.33 included loss on divestiture of our Russian operations which decreased operating income by $198 million\nand asset impairment charges of $27 million. These items decreased diluted EPS by $5.16 in the third quarter. Foreign\nexchange transaction loss decreased operating income by $1 million and earnings per share by $0.02. Excluding these items\n1\nresults in an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.29 (1) in the third quarter. During the third quarter, IPG generated $66 million in cash\nfrom operations and spent $23 million on capital expenditures and $74 million on share repurchases.\nBusiness Outlook and Financial Guidance\n“We continue to believe we are bouncing along the bottom of a muted demand environment, which is supported by a book-to-\nbill of one for the third quarter. IPG’s strong technology portfolio and expertise across lasers positions us well in new growth\nareas where fiber lasers can replace incumbent technologies and differentiates us from competition,\" concluded Dr. Gitin.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, IPG expects revenue of $210 million to $240 million, gross margin between 35% and 38%, and\noperating expenses of $78 million to $80 million. The Company expects the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 25%,\nincluding certain discrete items. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.05 to $0.35. This\nguidance excludes Russian operations which were sold in the third quarter.\nAs discussed in more detail in the \"Safe Harbor\" passage of this news release, actual results may differ from this guidance due\nto various factors including, but not limited to, trade policy changes and trade restrictions, product demand, order cancellations\nand delays, competition, tariffs, currency fluctuations and general economic conditions.

The Company has provided adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross\nmargin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures presented\nby the Company that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not\nbe considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial\nmeasure presented by the Company.\nWe define adjusted gross profit as gross profit as reported, adjusted for non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual changes, including\na one-time inventory provision related to a change in estimate of recoverability due to the current demand environment.\nWe define adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenue.\nWe define adjusted net income as net income as reported, adjusted for non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual changes, including\none-time charges incurred in connection with the disposition of our Russian operations, impairment of long-lived assets, loss on\nforeign currency exchange, tax impacts and a one-time adjustment to inventory provision related to a change in estimate of\nrecoverability due to the current demand environment, and other adjustments that the Company believes appropriate.\nWe define adjusted EPS as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period\noperating performance. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to\nunderstand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and\nother items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more\ndifficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts.\nIn addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our\nfinancial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors. However, these non-\nGAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that these non-GAAP financial measures may be different\nfrom non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Management may, however, utilize other measures to illustrate\nperformance in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly\ncomparable GAAP measures has been provided below. These non-GAAP measures exclude (a) a one-time adjustment to our\ninventory provision related to a change in estimate of recoverability due to the current demand environment, (b) one-time\nadjustments relating to the net loss from divestiture and sale of assets incurred in the disposition of our Russian operations in\nthe third quarter of 2024and (c) impairment of long lived assets related to our Belarusian operations.\n9\nIPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION\nSUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED)\nThree Months\nEnded September\n30,\n2024\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nGross profit $ 54,089\nGross margin 23.2 %\nAdd: Inventory provision 29,884\nAdjusted gross profit $ 83,973\nAdjusted gross margin 36.0 %\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024\n(In thousands, except per share data) Before Tax Tax Impact After Tax Per Diluted Share\nNet (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics\nCorporation and diluted EPS $ (233,594) $ (5.33)\nAdjustments to reconcile to adjusted net income:\nInventory provision $ 29,884 $ (8,407) 21,477 0.49\nLong-lived asset impairment 26,566 — 26,566 0.61\nLoss on divestiture 197,651 1,824 199,475 4.55\nLoss on foreign exchange 1,148 (190) 958 0.02\nDiscrete tax impacts (1,981) (1,981) (0.05)\nTotal adjustments $ 255,249 $ (8,754) $ 246,495 $ 5.62\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS $ 12,901 $ 0.29\n10"

These statements involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements in this presentation that are not\nstatements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, quarterly guidance. Factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially include risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with the strength or weakness of the business conditions in\nindustries and geographic markets that IPG serves, particularly the effect of downturns in the markets IPG serves; uncertainties and adverse\nchanges in the general economic conditions of markets; IPG's ability to penetrate new applications for fiber lasers and increase market share; the\nrate of acceptance and penetration of IPG's products; inability to manage risks associated with international customers and operations; changes\nin trade controls and trade policies; foreign currency fluctuations; high levels of fixed costs from IPG's vertical integration; the appropriateness of\nIPG's manufacturing capacity for the level of demand; competitive factors, including declining average selling prices; the effect of acquisitions and\ninvestments; inventory write-downs; asset impairment charges; intellectual property infringement claims and litigation; interruption in supply of\nkey components; manufacturing risks; government regulations and trade sanctions; and other risks identified in IPG's SEC filings.\nReaders are encouraged to refer to the risk factors described in IPG's Annual Report on Form 10-K (filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024)\nand IPG's reports filed with the SEC, as applicable.

IPG undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking\nstatements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nIPG’s financial results in this presentation are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (GAAP). IPG has also included certain supplemental non-GAAP financial information regarding adjusted gross profit, adjusted net\nincome and adjusted diluted earnings per share (each, a non-GAAP financial measure). The non-GAAP financial measures provided are a\nsupplement to, and not a substitute for, the IPG’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures\nare provided to enhance the investor's understanding and aid in their analysis of IPG's ongoing operations. Specifically, IPG believes the non-\nrecurring impact of certain inventory provisions, long-lived asset impairment, loss on divestiture and foreign currency losses, are not indicative of\nits core operating results and may obscure trends useful in evaluating IPG's continuing operating activities. The presentation of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAlso, these non-GAAP financial measures, as determined and presented by IPG, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures\nreported by other companies. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures are included in Appendix\nportion of this presentation.\n2\n© 2024 IPG PHOTONICS\nQ3 '24 Summary\n• Revenue declined year over year due to lower demand in general industrial and in e-mobility markets,\nbut sequential performance was more stable\n◦ Total revenue decreased 23% YoY mostly due to lower sales in cutting applications in North America and\nEurope and lower welding sales in China\n◦ Emerging growth products sales, which accounted for 45% of total revenue, declined sequentially due to\nlower e-mobility sales and lumpiness in medical revenue\n• Gross margin of 23.2% decreased due to higher inventory provisions and underabsorption of\nmanufacturing costs, partially offset by lower import duties and shipping costs.

Our third quarter revenue came in at the high end\nof our guidance adjusted for the sale of our Russian operations in August. Adjusted earnings per\nshare also came in at the top end of the guidance. We continue to focus on what we can control\nwhile navigating a demand environment that has remained muted. Since joining in June, I've\nfocused on diving deep into key aspects of IPG’s business and strategy. We’re making good\nprogress executing on our key initiatives and I'm even more excited about our future\nopportunities than when I joined. I’ll share a few highlights.\nI will start with the sale of our Russian operations. As I mentioned on our last call, our team has\ndone a tremendous job since the start of the war in Ukraine, executing flawlessly to serve the\nneeds of our customers by quickly rebuilding our manufacturing infrastructure to ensure we did\nnot miss a single shipment. This was not an easy task. This quarter, we were finally able to\ncompletely exit Russia with the sale of our operations in the country. With this transition now in\nthe rearview mirror, we are focusing on optimizing our global manufacturing footprint to drive\nbetter efficiency, while ensuring enough capacity for an uptick in demand in future quarters. In\naddition, we are working to decrease the cost of our products with a new generation of laser\ndiodes that will also enable a significant reduction in the form factor of our high-power fiber\nlasers.\nThe second highlight is our announcement today that we signed an agreement to acquire\ncleanLASER, a leader in laser cleaning systems based in Germany. IPG has a strong track\nrecord of driving the usage of lasers in new applications and solutions and this remains a key\npart of our growth and differentiation strategy. This tuck-in acquisition advances our capabilities\nin the large and attractive cleaning market where we see a lot of opportunities. It will enable us\nPage 2\nto expand the use of lasers more quickly into this area. The acquisition highlights our focus on\nlong-term growth. I’ll talk more about how cleanLASER fits within IPG’s business shortly.\nMy review of the business confirms the strength of our product pipeline, technical know-how and\nfuture market opportunities. We have work to do to execute on these opportunities and we’re\ngoing to be investing in a number of key areas. We will make sure we’re allocating resources to\ncapitalize on high-value programs in areas such as medical, cleaning and micro-machining, and\nalso strengthening the organization to ensure we are optimized to execute on these\nopportunities. We have a robust product pipeline that presents attractive opportunities to drive\ndifferentiation around lasers and systems, and to deliver complete solutions, process know-how\nand world-class support to our customers. All of this cannot be easily replicated by competitors.\nOur focus will remain on providing a high level of service and support, maximizing uptime and\nlowering the total cost of ownership for our customers.\nOn the organization front, we need to get stronger to ensure we are executing at a high level.\nThis includes how we drive decisions, efficiency throughout the organization, and our go-to-\nmarket approach. We will be making some investments here that I’ll provide more color on in\nfuture calls, but the main theme is that we are going to be stronger operators and more\nformidable competitors as we exit the current demand downturn. Because of the prolonged\ndowncycle in the industrial market that we are facing, we need to make sure we are managing\nwith agility as we invest for the long term. Over the past few months, we’ve achieved additional\ncost efficiencies and implemented cost avoidance initiatives, and, more recently, executed a\ntargeted headcount reduction. We expect to reallocate these savings to opportunities that will\ndrive long-term growth for IPG.\nPage 3\nI’ll have more to share on all the initiatives underway in coming months, but for now let me make\nit clear that we are moving purposefully and operating with agility as we put IPG in a strong\nposition both for demand recovery and for long-term growth opportunities in our industry. And\nwe are starting this from a solid foundation, with great products, customer relationships, strong\ncash flow generation and one of the industry’s best balance sheets including a billion dollars in\ncash and no debt.\nLet’s now turn to the current business environment. Overall demand continues to bounce along\nthe bottom. Customer conversations indicate a cautious spending environment across many\nmarkets, driven by economic and political uncertainty and reduced end-market demand in the\nkey areas of general manufacturing and e-mobility. Our fourth quarter guidance reflects a\ncontinuation of this trend, and we currently don’t have any visibility into an improved demand\nenvironment.\nTurning to our key applications. In welding, revenue decreased modestly year over year primarily\ndue to lower demand for e-mobility in China. Despite the year-over-year comparison remaining\nnegative, it’s important to note that welding sales have been relatively stable over the last three\nquarters and there are several good signs of progress for IPG. We are winning business with\nsome large global customers in EV and general automotive applications, and driving further\nadoption of our welding solutions. Our real-time weld monitoring system is gaining acceptance\nwith automotive and non-automotive customers where weld quality is critical for safe\nperformance of their products. Additionally EV sales improved sequentially, which demonstrates\nthat we are gaining market share in EV applications despite a downturn in battery capacity\ninstallations. I am also encouraged to see growth in our welding systems sales, with both\nautomated systems and handheld posting better year-over-year results. Welding systems for\nmedical device manufacturing are gaining traction around the world, and we are seeing strong\nPage 4\ndemand for our solutions in this market. We are having great conversations with important\ncustomers that indicate a favorable longer-term adoption curve, and we are well positioned for\nfurther gains. Overall, across welding applications, we continue to focus on the total solution for\ncustomers by providing best-in-class lasers, inline real-time weld monitoring and full automation\nto solve customers’ manufacturing challenges.\nIn cutting, sales declined significantly year-over-year, primarily in Europe and U.S., as flat-sheet\ncutting remains weak. Amid an environment of weaker manufacturing PMI, our customers have\nnot resumed normal purchasing activities although some of them have made progress working\ndown inventories.\nOn a positive note, I continue to be enthusiastic about our opportunities in the growth areas\nwhere fiber lasers can replace incumbent technologies. That’s the reason behind the\ncleanLASER acquisition as we look to increase our penetration into industrial cleaning\napplications. Cleaning is an important opportunity because traditional cleaning applications often\nrely on high levels of environmentally unfriendly consumables, such as acids and abrasives that\nmust be disposed of. The processes may also involve high water consumption. By contrast,\nlaser cleaning systems are environmentally friendly with limited or no process waste and have a\ncompelling total cost of ownership. cleanLASER has a strong foothold in Europe as a long-time\nleader in the cleaning space. They have a wide array of customers in industries such as\nautomotive, aerospace, medical, food and other markets. This is a great example of a targeted\nand prudent approach you will see us take in M&A activity. We’ve known the cleanLASER team\nand have supplied our laser sources to them for a number of years. Our businesses are\ncomplementary in many ways, bringing together our respective strong customer bases in North\nAmerica and Europe, as well as product and technology synergies. We believe that together we\nPage 5\ncan help accelerate the adoption of laser systems in industrial cleaning. Tim will provide some\nmore details on the structure of the deal and its financial impact.\nI want to emphasize that I am extremely excited about a number of products and technologies in\ndevelopment, so we will be doubling down on some of them over the next couple of years. While\nit is too early to share the details, I believe these products can provide significant differentiation\nfor IPG in medical, micro-machining and advanced applications, all of which provide large and\nattractive market opportunities for us.\nMoving to our outlook, our third quarter book-to-bill was 1, excluding Russian sales. As I\nmentioned earlier, we continue to believe we are bouncing along the bottom of this demand\ncycle. Across our geographies, we have seen some stability in demand in China, offset by\ncontinued macro uncertainty in Europe and U.S. We have limited visibility beyond the current\nquarter but are remaining hopeful for more stability in 2025.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Tim.\nPage 6\nTim Mammen:\nThank you Mark, and good morning everyone. My comments will generally follow the earnings\ncall presentation which is available on our investor relations website.\nI will start with the financial review on slide 5.\nRevenue in the third quarter was $233 million, a decline of 23% year over year and down 8%\nsequentially when adjusted for Russian revenue, which was $7 million in the quarter. Revenue\ncame in at the top of our guidance. Foreign currency did not have a meaningful impact on\nrevenue this quarter. Revenue from materials processing applications decreased 22% year over\nyear, primarily due to lower cutting sales, while revenue from other applications decreased 28%\ndue to unevenness in medical and advanced application sales.\nGAAP gross margin was 23.2%, a decrease of over 20 percentage points year over year,\nprimarily due to excess inventory provisions which provided a 12.8 percentage point headwind to\nGAAP gross margin this quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 36.0%, above the midpoint of our\nguidance. Additionally, lower absorption of manufacturing costs, as a result of lower revenue and\nour continued effort to rightsize inventory, reduced gross margin by 660 basis points. These\nnegative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by a decrease in import duty and shipping\ncosts as well as a further decrease of $5 million in sequential manufacturing expenses.\nMost of the increase in inventory provisions was related to excess quantities of strategic\nelectronic and diode components. The provision related to the electronic components was driven\nby the severe issues that affected the electronics supply chain over the past several years,\nwhich resulted in significant purchases of these items as a strategic backup. Given the\nslowdown in our business and unsuccessful attempts to sell the electronic inventory in the\nsecondary market, the realizable value of these items is now uncertain. The provision for excess\nPage 7\ndiode components is a result of the transition from the current generation of diodes to the new,\nmore cost-effective high-power platform. Although this transition will happen over the next 12 to\n15 months, our analysis shows that we will not consume all the existing inventory.\nOperating expenses came in at the low end of our expectations due to the sale of our Russian\nbusiness and focus on operating efficiencies. Currency translation had a minor impact on\nrevenue and gross profit in the quarter of approximately $1 million. Foreign currency transaction\nlosses had a negative impact on operating income of $1 million, or $0.02 per share.\nGAAP operating loss was $253 million and included $198 million loss on sale of assets related\nto the disposal of our Russian operations and $27 million in asset impairment charges due to\nrecent EU trade controls which curtailed our ability to operate in Belarus. We are currently\nevaluating strategic options related to this business. As a result of these items, we reported a\nnet loss of $234 million, or $5.33 per diluted share. Excluding loss on sale of assets, asset\nimpairment charges and excess inventory provisions, our adjusted EPS was $0.29 in the third\nquarter, at the top of our guidance. We have provided a reconciliation to adjusted net income\nand adjusted earnings per share in the press release and earnings call presentation.\nMoving to the revenue performance by region on slide 6. Sales in North America decreased\n20% year over year due to lower sales in cutting applications and a decline in medical revenue.\nOur medical orders from a large customer can fluctuate significantly quarter over quarter due to\ntheir inventory management practices, adding some unevenness to these revenues. Other\napplications performed better with growth in welding and marking. EV investment is being\ndelayed in the region, but traditional automotive investments seem to be bouncing back slightly.\nIn Europe, sales decreased 29% compared to the prior year due to lower sales in cutting\napplications. Large cutting OEM customers continued to manage their inventories with only low\nPage 8\norder rates as economic conditions in Europe continue to be weak and industrial demand\nremains muted.\nRevenue in China decreased 27% year over year due to lower sales in cutting and welding\napplications as a result of soft demand in general industrial and e-mobility markets, which was\npartially offset by growth in 3D printing applications. Cutting sales were also impacted by the\nchallenging competitive environment.\nMoving to a summary of our balance sheet and cash flow on slide 7, we ended the quarter with\ncash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $1.0 billion and no debt. Cash provided\nby operations was $66 million and capital expenditures were $23 million during the third quarter.\nWe continued to generate cash from inventory as we manage our investment in working capital.\nThe proceeds received from the divestiture of our Russian operations resulted in a net cash\noutflow of $25 million. We spent $74 million on share repurchases in the third quarter and $286\nmillion year to date. While maintaining a strong balance sheet, we have returned a significant\namount of capital to shareholders through share repurchases since the beginning of 2021. As\nmentioned earlier, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire cleanLASER for approximately\n$75 million.\nMoving to our outlook on slide 9, for the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue of $210\nmillion to $240 million. The revenue guidance range is similar to the last quarter, but after\nadjusting for Russian sales, reflects an increase in revenue guidance range of $10 million\nsequentially. The fourth quarter gross margin is estimated to be between 35% and 38%. We\nanticipate delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.05 to $0.35, with\napproximately 44 million diluted common shares outstanding.\nLet me provide additional guidance on the financial impact of the divestitures and acquisitions.\nThe sale of Russia is expected to reduce our revenue by approximately $40 million on an annual\nPage 9\nbasis, but should have a neutral impact on operating income as the business was running at\napproximately breakeven after the restructuring. Our total operating expenses will come down as\na result of the sale, but the decrease will be partially offset by our annual merit increase.\nFurthermore, we will continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing to\nsupport technology development and closer collaboration with customers.\nThe announced acquisition of cleanLASER, is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending\nregulatory approvals, and is not a part of our guidance. We expect this acquisition to add\napproximately $30 million to revenue in the first year. It will be approximately neutral to GAAP\noperating income due to accruals for earn-outs based on future growth and profitability targets\nfor the business.\nAs discussed in the \"Safe Harbor\" passage of today's earnings press release, our guidance is\nbased upon current market conditions and expectations, assumes exchange rates referenced in\nour earnings press release, and is subject to risks outlined in the \"Safe Harbor\" and the\ncompany's reports with the SEC.\nWith that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nPage 10\nEugene Fedotoff:\nThank you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in IPG. We will be\nparticipating in a number of investor events this quarter and are looking forward to speaking with\nyou again soon. Have a great day everyone.\nPage 11"

CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation — The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by IPG Photonics Corporation, or\n\"IPG\", \"its\" or the \"Company\". Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\"SEC\"). The condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company's accounts and those of its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and\nnotes thereto in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn the opinion of the Company's management, the financial information for the interim periods presented reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair\npresentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements are\nnot necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year.\nSubsequent Events — The Company has considered the impact of subsequent events through the filing date of these financial statements. There were no events\nthrough the filing date of these financial statements required to be disclosed.\n2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAdopted Pronouncements — In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-07\"), which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses on an annual and interim basis. Under the new guidance an entity is required to disclose the title and position of the chief operating decision maker\n(\"CODM\") and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to\nallocate resources. The ASU also requires that an entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by this ASU and all existing segment\ndisclosures in Topic 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. The Company adopted this standard during fiscal year 2024, and will start disclosing the required information in fiscal year ending December\n31, 2024. The adoption of this standard only impacts disclosures and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nPronouncements Currently Under Evaluation — In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income\nTax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"), which requires an entity on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional\ninformation for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance also requires an entity to disclose on an annual basis information about income\ntaxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of\nthis ASU. The adoption of this standard only impacts disclosures and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n3. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nSales are derived from products for different applications: fiber lasers, diode lasers, systems and accessories for materials processing; fiber lasers, diodes and\namplifiers for advanced applications; and fiber lasers, systems and fibers for medical applications.\nThe following tables represent a disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSales by Application\nMaterials processing $ 207,063 $ 265,226 $ 659,201 $ 892,379\nOther applications 26,080 36,175 83,596 96,167\nTotal $ 233,143 $ 301,401 $ 742,797 $ 988,546\n6\nTable of Contents\nIPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nSales by Product\nHigh Power Continuous Wave (\"CW\") Lasers $ 81,325 $ 119,512 $ 254,343 $ 419,538\nMedium Power CW Lasers 15,110 20,937 47,082 57,146\nPulsed Lasers 33,470 41,420 110,825 150,569\nQuasi-Continuous Wave (\"QCW\") Lasers 10,180 10,856 36,520 35,978\nLaser and Non-Laser Systems 35,265 37,493 111,436 117,064\nOther Revenue including Amplifiers, Service, Parts, Accessories and Change\nin Deferred Revenue 57,793 71,183 182,591 208,251\nTotal $ 233,143 $ 301,401 $ 742,797 $ 988,546\nSales by Geography\nNorth America $ 57,294 $ 71,349 $ 198,163 $ 225,649\nEurope:\nGermany 25,787 23,423 66,615 72,218\nOther Europe 41,485 71,946 154,704 225,231\nAsia:\nChina 61,769 84,408 189,374 284,262\nJapan 14,495 15,829 41,408 54,196\nOther Asia 29,470 29,741 82,091 111,457\nRest of World 2,843 4,705 10,442 15,533\nTotal $ 233,143 $ 301,401 $ 742,797 $ 988,546\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nTiming of Revenue Recognition\nGoods and services transferred at a point in time $ 223,269 $ 289,477 $ 713,913 $ 952,173\nGoods and services transferred over time 9,874 11,924 28,884 36,373\nTotal $ 233,143 $ 301,401 $ 742,797 $ 988,546\nOne of the Company's customers accounted for 14% of the Company's net accounts receivable as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe Company enters into contracts to sell lasers and spare parts, for which revenue is generally recognized upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms\nof the contract. The Company also provides installation services and extended warranties. The Company frequently receives consideration from a customer prior to\ntransferring goods to the customer under the terms of a sales contract. The Company records customer deposits related to these prepayments, which represent a\ncontract liability. The Company also records deferred revenue related to installation services when consideration is received before the services have been performed.\nThe standalone selling price for installation services is determined based on the estimated number of days of service technician time required for installation at\nstandard service rates. The Company recognizes customer deposits and deferred revenue as net sales after control of the goods or services has been transferred to the\ncustomer and all revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company bills customers for extended warranties upon entering into the agreement with the customer,\nresulting in deferred revenue that is recognized over the period of the extended warranty contract. The Company recognizes revenue over time on contracts for the\nsale of large scale materials processing systems. The timing of customer payments on these contracts generally differs from the timing of revenue recognized. If\nrevenue recognized exceeds customer payments, a contract asset is recorded and if customer payments exceed revenue recognized, a contract liability is recorded.\nContract assets are included within prepaid expense and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Contract liabilities are included within\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Certain deferred revenues related to extended warranties in excess of one\nyear from the balance sheet date are included within other long-term liabilities and deferred income taxes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n7\nTable of Contents\nIPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe following table reflects the changes in the Company's contract assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nSeptember 30, January 1, September 30, January 1,\n2024 2024 Change 2023 2023 Change\nContract assets\nContract assets $ 10,835 $ 9,383 $ 1,452 $ 5,623 $ 8,620 $ (2,997)\nContract liabilities\nContract liabilities - current 52,271 69,219 (16,948) 66,961 80,068 (13,107)\nContract liabilities - long-term 3,015 2,851 164 2,851 3,142 (291)\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company recognized revenue of $6,366 and $7,730, respectively, that was included in\ncontract liabilities at the beginning of each year.

LOSS ON DIVESTITURE AND IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nThe Company recorded a loss on divestiture of $197,651 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was included in Net loss from divestiture and sale of\nassets in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions, the Company's ability to\nship and receive components from its Russian operations was significantly curtailed. On August 29, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Russian subsidiary,\nScientific and Technical Association “IRE-Polus”, pursuant to a share purchase agreement with a purchaser entity associated with Softline Projects LLC and existing\nmanagement of IRE-Polus for $51,096. The loss mainly consisted of $59,293 related to the carrying value of net assets of the Russian subsidiary that was in excess\nof net proceeds received on the sale and $135,346 related to the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income that was previously\nincluded in stockholders' equity of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEvaluation of Belarusian Operations — On June 29, 2024, the European Union (“EU”) issued new sanctions for Belarus. The sanctions, effective July 1 2024,\nallow shipments to our German operations related to existing contracts to continue through October 2, 2024. The Company completed fulfillment of existing\ncontracts in September 2024. The Company is no longer able to continue to supply laser cabinets and other mechanical components from our factory in Belarus. As a\nresult, the Company completed an impairment analysis of the assets in Belarus during the third quarter of 2024. The Company recorded $26,566 of impairment of\nlong-lived assets, primarily fixed assets in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The long-lived asset impairment charge was based on a\nprobability-weighted average of valuations using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the long-lived assets in\nBelarus.\n5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company's financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and revolving lines of credit.\n8\nTable of Contents\nIPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe valuation techniques used to measure fair value are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from\nindependent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1,\ndefined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets\nthat are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to\ndevelop its own assumptions. The Company classifies its financial instruments according to the prescribed criteria.\nThe fair value of money market fund deposits, cash equivalent term deposits, accounts receivable, accounts payable and drawings on revolving lines of credit is\nreasonably close to their carrying amounts due to the short maturity of most of these instruments or as a result of the competitive market interest rates, which have\nbeen negotiated. The fair value of the Company's commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury and agency obligations and term deposits are based on Level 2\ninputs.\nThe following table presents fair value information related to the Company's assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets:\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market fund deposits $ 185,862 $ 185,862 $ — $ —\nCommercial paper 156,412 — 156,412 —\nU.S. Treasury and agency obligations 88,610 — 88,610 —\nTerm deposits 22,145 — 22,145 —\nCorporate bonds 13,416 — 13,416 —\nTotal cash equivalents 466,445 185,862 280,583 —\nShort-term investments:\nCommercial paper 75,523 — 75,523 —\nU.S. Treasury and agency obligations 56,887 — 56,887 —\nTerm deposits 3,048 — 3,048 —\nTotal short-term investments 135,458 — 135,458 —\nTotal $ 601,903 $ 185,862 $ 416,041 $ —\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market fund deposits $ 171,632 $ 171,632 $ — $ —\nTerm deposits 83,965 — 83,965 —\nCorporate bonds 23,516 — 23,516 —\nCommercial paper 6,369 — 6,369 —\nTotal cash equivalents 285,482 171,632 113,850 —\nShort-term investments:\nCommercial paper 244,571 — 244,571 —\nCorporate bonds 243,915 — 243,915 —\nU.S. Treasury and agency obligations 171,316 — 171,316 —\nTerm deposits 3,009 — 3,009 —\nTotal short-term investments 662,811 — 662,811 —\nTotal $ 948,293 $ 171,632 $ 776,661 $ —\nThere were no impairments for the investments considered held-to-maturity during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

INCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes was a benefit of $8,920 and a tax expense of $5,441, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The\neffective tax rate was 3.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was tax expense provided on the\nLoss before provision for income taxes.\nThis compares to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, where the provisions for income taxes were tax expenses of $12,826 and $55,272,\nrespectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were a tax expense of 18.9% and 23.8%, respectively.\nThere was a tax detriment for both periods in 2024 related primarily to $41,482 of losses not benefitted from the loss on divestiture of Russian operations,\nwhich occurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the divestiture of Russian operations, the other discrete tax items for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 did not have a significant effect on the Company's tax rate. Excluding the divestiture of Russian operations, the other discrete tax\ndetriment of $1,435 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related primarily to equity-based compensation which was partially offset by a benefit related to\nreductions of tax reserves.\nThere were net discrete tax detriments of $169 and $390 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The discrete detriments in 2023\ndid not have a significant effect on the Company's tax rate. Excluding discrete items, the overall effective tax rate in 2024 decreased as compared to 2023 due the\ndecrease of income before provision for income taxes in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nThe Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes. The Company classifies interest and\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n13\nTable of Contents\nIPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ 17,176 $ 15,841\nChange in prior period positions (3,130) (1,274)\nAdditions for tax positions in current period 249 3,738\nForeign currency translation 94 (527)\nBalance, end of period $ 14,389 $ 17,778\nThe liability for uncertain tax benefits is included in other long-term liabilities and deferred income taxes at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nSubstantially all of the liability for uncertain tax benefits related to various federal, state and foreign income tax matters would benefit the Company's effective tax\nrate, if the tax benefits are recognized.\n14.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and\nprojections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking\nstatements. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nOverview\nWe develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fiber lasers and diode lasers that are used for diverse applications, primarily in materials processing. We\nalso manufacture and sell complementary products used with our lasers including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical processing heads, in-\nline sensors and chillers. In addition, we offer laser-based and non-laser based systems for certain markets and applications. Our portfolio of laser solutions is used in\nmaterials processing, medical, and advanced applications. We sell our products globally to original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\"), system integrators and end\nusers. We market our products internationally, primarily through our direct sales force. Our major manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and\nGermany. In response to the risks from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have ceased new investment in our Belarusian operations and expanded our manufacturing\noperations in Germany, the United States and Italy, and have added manufacturing capacity in Poland to meet the demand for our products and our sales and support\nneeds. We have sales and service offices and applications laboratories worldwide.\nWe are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture most of the key components used in our finished products, from semiconductor diodes to\noptical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers and complementary products. Our vertically integrated operations allow us to reduce manufacturing costs, control quality,\nrapidly develop and integrate advanced products and protect our proprietary technology.\nFactors and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results\nIn reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our\nfinancial performance.\nSale of our Russian Operations. On August 29, 2024, we completed the sale of our Russian subsidiary, Scientific and Technical Association “IRE-Polus”,\npursuant to a share purchase agreement with a purchaser entity associated with Softline Projects LLC and existing management of IRE-Polus for $51.1 million. We\nrecorded a loss on divestiture of $197.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was included in Net loss from divestiture and sale of assets in our\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The loss included $59.3 million related to the carrying value of net assets of our Russian subsidiary that was in\nexcess of net proceeds received on the sale. Included in the net assets sold was cash and cash equivalents of $74.0 million. Also included in the loss was\n$135.3 million related to the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income that was previously included in Stockholders' equity of\nour Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions, our ability to ship and receive components from our\nRussian operations was significantly curtailed. In response, we expanded our manufacturing capacity in Germany, the United States and Italy, and added new\nmanufacturing capacity in Poland which effectively offset our inability to utilize the Russian operations.\nBelarusian Operations. We manufacture laser cabinets and other mechanical components in Belarus. In response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the EU issued\nadditional sanctions impacting commerce with Belarus on June 29, 2024, which restricted the supply of laser cabinets and other mechanical components from our\nfactory in Belarus to our Germany operations after October 2, 2024. As a result of the sanctions and their impact on our Belarus operations, we completed an\nimpairment analysis of our Belarus assets during the third quarter of 2024 and recorded $26.6 million of impairment of long-lived asset in our Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income. At September 30, 2024, the remaining value of the long-lived assets in Belarus was $3.8 million, net working capital excluding\ncash was $0.4 million and cash was $5.8 million. The net asset value of our Belarus subsidiary has been reduced by $17.9 million due to the cumulative translation\neffect of the Belarusian ruble compared to the U.S. dollar, which is included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders' equity. We may\nincur additional asset impairment charges related to the Belarus operations and the other comprehensive loss that is currently in the equity section of our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets could be charged to our condensed consolidated statements of income.\nWe continue to review our operations in Belarus including potential strategic alternatives. We have qualified third party vendors to supply components\npreviously supplied from Belarus and have begun purchasing from them. Our Board of Directors monitors and continues to assess risks associated with our\nBelarusian operations.\n15\nTable of Contents\nSupply chain and inventory balances. Because of disruptions to our supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine related sanctions, we\nincreased our inventory safety stocks and placed non-cancellable orders for long lead time items. These caused our inventory levels and our days inventory on hand\nto increase. During the third quarter of 2024, we undertook an analysis of the safety stock and recorded additional provisions for excess inventory reserves of\napproximately $20.7 million. In addition, we recorded $8.8 million of inventory reserves related to inventory that became obsolete due to the launch of new\ncomponents.\nNet sales. Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter can be affected by the timing\nof orders received from customers, the timing of shipments, the mix of OEM orders and one-time orders for products with large purchase prices, competitive\npressures, acquisitions, economic and political conditions in a certain country or region and seasonal factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity\nthroughout the year in the regions where we operate. Net sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products for use in new applications in the end\nmarkets that we serve. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several months. The\nadoption of our products by a new customer or qualification in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for a period, which may then slow until we\npenetrate new markets or obtain new customers. Foreign exchange rates also affect our net sales, due to changes in the U.S. dollar value of sales made in foreign\ncurrencies.\nOur business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by end users, particularly by manufacturers using our products for materials processing, which\nincludes general manufacturing, automotive including electric vehicles (\"EV\"), other transportation, aerospace, heavy industry, consumer, semiconductor and\nelectronics. Approximately 89% of our revenues for the first three quarters of 2024, and 90% of the full fiscal year of 2023 were from customers using our products\nfor materials processing. Although applications within materials processing are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has\nexperienced sudden and severe downturns. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by end users of materials\nprocessing equipment and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending.\nIn response to inflation in recent years, some global central banks have adopted less accommodating monetary policy and have increased benchmark interest\nrates in several major global economies. The increase in interest rates is intended to dampen demand that could lead to regional or global recession that may reduce\ndemand for our products. In addition, an increase in interest rates would increase the cost of equipment financed with leases or debt. As we start to see inflation\nmoderate in the second half of 2024, global central banks may adopt more accommodating monetary policy and reduce benchmark interest rates.\nIn recent years, our net sales and margins have been negatively impacted by tariffs and trade policy. New tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could\ntrigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments.\nWe are also susceptible to global or regional disruptions such as political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency\nvalues, natural disasters and pandemics to the extent that they affect macroeconomic conditions, global supply chains or individual IPG locations.\nThe average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as increased competition,\ndecreased manufacturing costs and increased unit volumes. We may also reduce selling prices in order to penetrate new markets and applications. Furthermore, we\nmay negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that place high unit-volume orders.\nThe secular shift to fiber laser technology in large materials processing applications, such as welding and cutting applications, had a positive effect on our sales\ntrends in the past such that our sales trends were often better than other capital equipment manufacturers in both positive and negative economic cycles. As the\nsecular shift to fiber laser technology matures in such applications, our sales trends are more susceptible to economic cycles, which can broadly affect the demand for\ncapital equipment including machine tools and industrial lasers, and competition from other fiber laser manufacturers.\nGross margin. Our total gross margin in any period can be significantly affected by a number of factors, including net sales, production volumes, competitive\nfactors, product mix, and by other factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, tariffs and shipping costs. Many of these factors are\nnot under our control. The following are examples of factors affecting gross margin:\n• As our products mature, we can experience additional competition which tends to decrease average selling prices and affects gross margin;\n16\nTable of Contents\n• Our gross margin can be significantly affected by product mix. Within each of our product categories, the gross margin is generally higher for devices\nwith greater average power. These higher power products often have better performance, more difficult specifications to attain and fewer competing\nproducts in the marketplace;\n• Higher power lasers also use a greater number of optical components, improving absorption of fixed overhead costs and enabling economies of scale in\nmanufacturing;\n• The gross margin for certain specialty products may be higher because there are fewer or sometimes no equivalent competing products;\n• Customers that purchase devices in greater unit volumes generally are provided lower prices per device than customers that purchase fewer units. In\ngeneral, lower selling prices to high unit volume customers reduce gross margin although this may be partially offset by improved absorption of fixed\noverhead costs associated with larger product volumes, which drive economies of scale;\n• Gross margin on systems can be lower than gross margin for our lasers and sub-systems, depending on the configuration, volume and competitive forces,\namong other factors;\n• Persistent inflation leading to increases in average manufacturing salaries as well as an increase in the purchase price of components including, but not\nlimited to, electronic components and metal parts could negatively impact gross margin if we are not able to pass those increases on to customers by\nincreasing the selling price of our products;\n• Changes in relative exchange rates between currencies we receive when selling our products and currencies we use to pay our manufacturing expenses;\nand finally,\n• Our gross margin from products on new manufacturing lines can be lower due to production inefficiencies and high scrap costs.\nWe expect that some new technologies, products and systems will have returns above our cost of capital but may have gross margins below our corporate\naverage. If we are able to develop opportunities that are significant in size, competitively advantageous or leverage our existing technology base and leadership, our\ncurrent gross margin levels may not be maintained. Instead, we aim to deliver industry-leading levels of gross margins by growing sales, by taking market share in\nexisting markets, or by developing new applications and markets we address, by reducing the cost of our products and by optimizing the efficiency of our\nmanufacturing operations.\nA high proportion of our costs is fixed so costs are generally difficult to adjust or may take time to adjust in response to changes in demand. In addition, our\nfixed costs increase as we expand our capacity. If we expand capacity faster than is required by sales growth, gross margins could be negatively affected. Gross\nmargins generally decline if production volumes are lower as a result of a decrease in sales or a reduction in inventory because the absorption of fixed manufacturing\ncosts will be reduced. Gross margins generally improve when the opposite occurs. If both sales and inventory decrease in the same period, the decline in gross\nmargin may be greater if we cannot reduce fixed costs or choose not to reduce fixed costs to match the decrease in the level of production. If we experience a decline\nin sales that reduces absorption of our fixed costs, or if we have production issues, our gross margins will be negatively affected.\nWe also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or are determined to be excess. Any provision for such\nslow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded provisions for slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory totaling\n$43.4 million and $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $70.3 million and $32.4 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded additional inventory provisions of $29.5 million attributed\nto items previously considered safety stock and items that became technologically obsolete.\nSelling and general and administrative expenses. In the past, we invested in selling and general and administrative costs in order to support continued growth\nin the Company. As the secular shift to fiber laser technology matures, our sales growth becomes more susceptible to the cyclical trends typical of capital equipment\nmanufacturers. Accordingly, our future management of and investments in selling and general and administrative expenses will also be influenced by these trends,\nalthough we may still invest in selling or general and administrative functions to support certain initiatives even in economic down cycles. Certain general and\nadministrative expenses are not related to the level of sales and may vary quarter to quarter based primarily upon the level of acquisitions, litigation and project\nrelated consulting expenses.\nResearch and development expenses. We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop\nnew components, products, systems and applications technology. We believe that these\n17\nTable of Contents\ninvestments will sustain our position as a leader in the fiber laser industry and will support development of new products that can address new markets and growth\nopportunities. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period.\nGoodwill and long-lived assets impairments. We review our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Negative industry or economic\ntrends, including reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, lack of growth in our relevant business units, differences in\nthe estimated product acceptance rates, or market prices below the carrying value of long-lived assets evaluated for sale could lead to impairment charges against our\nlong-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs noted above, we recorded $26.6 million impairment of long-lived assets included in Impairment of long-lived assets in our Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income. After impairment, the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets in Belarus is $3.8 million.\nOur valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and\nto rely heavily on projections of future operating performance at many points during the analysis. Also, the process of evaluating the potential impairment of\ngoodwill is subjective. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual\nresults. If our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record charges to earnings in our\nfinancial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nForeign exchange. Because we are a U.S.-based company doing business globally, we have both translational and transactional exposure to fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates. Changes in the relative exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies in which our subsidiaries operate directly\naffects our sales, costs and earnings. Differences in the relative exchange rates between where we sell our products and where we incur manufacturing and other\noperating costs (primarily in the U.S. and Germany) also affects our costs and earnings. Certain currencies experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like\nthe euro, the Russian ruble, the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen have had and could have an additional significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. For the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024, the foreign exchange loss was primarily attributed to the appreciation of the euro as compared to the U.S. dollar. Our European\nsubsidiaries have certain net assets denominated in U.S. dollars. Our ability to adjust the foreign currency selling prices of products in response to changes in\nexchange rates is limited and may not offset the impact of the changes in exchange rates on the translated value of sales or costs. In addition, if we increase the\nselling price of our products in local currencies, this could have a negative impact on the demand for our products.\nIncome taxes. We are evaluating the impact of countries adopting tax legislation in accordance with the proposals presented by the OECD (Pillars 1 and 2).\nBased on the current drafts of the proposals, the tax impact in most countries will not be significant in 2024 due to an effective tax rate in those countries in excess of\n15% or as a result of the transition rules that are proposed.\nMajor customers. While we have historically depended on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net sales, the composition of this group can\nchange from period to period. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a percentage of our net sales was 12% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 13%, and 15% for the full years 2023 and 2022, respectively. One of our customers accounted for 14% of our net accounts receivable as of both\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We seek to add new customers and to expand our relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the\ncomposition of our significant customers will continue to change. We generally do not enter into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase a fixed\nnumber or large volume of our products. If any of our significant customers substantially reduced their purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected.\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNet sales. Net sales decreased by $68.3 million, or 22.6%, to $233.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $301.4 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe table below sets forth sales by application:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nSales by Application % of Total % of Total\nMaterials processing $ 207,063 88.8 % $ 265,226 88.0 % $ (58,163) (21.9)%\nOther applications 26,080 11.2 % 36,175 12.0 % (10,095) (27.9)%\nTotal $ 233,143 100.0 % $ 301,401 100.0 % $ (68,258) (22.6)%\nThe table below sets forth sales by type of product and other revenue:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nSales by Product % of Total % of Total\nHigh Power Continuous Wave (\"CW\") Lasers $ 81,325 34.9 % $ 119,512 39.7 % $ (38,187) (32.0)%\nMedium Power CW Lasers 15,110 6.5 % 20,937 6.9 % (5,827) (27.8)%\nPulsed Lasers 33,470 14.3 % 41,420 13.8 % (7,950) (19.2)%\nQuasi-Continuous Wave (\"QCW\") Lasers 10,180 4.4 % 10,856 3.6 % (676) (6.2)%\nLaser and Non-Laser Systems 35,265 15.1 % 37,493 12.4 % (2,228) (5.9)%\nOther Revenue including Amplifiers, Service, Parts,\nAccessories and Change in Deferred Revenue 57,793 24.8 % 71,183 23.6 % (13,390) (18.8)%\nTotal $ 233,143 100.0 % $ 301,401 100.0 % $ (68,258) (22.6)%\nMaterials processing\nSales for materials processing applications decreased due to lower sales of high power CW lasers, medium power CW lasers, pulsed lasers, QCW lasers, laser\nand non-laser systems and other laser products and services.\n• High power CW laser sales decreased due to lower sales for cutting and welding applications. Within cutting applications, the decrease in sales was\nattributable to softer industrial demand primarily in Europe and the U.S., increased competition from Chinese fiber laser suppliers and inventory\nmanagement by OEM customers, while welding applications were primarily impacted by a delay in e-mobility investments in China and soft general\nindustrial demand in Europe.\n• Medium power CW laser sales decreased due to lower demand in welding, partially offset by an increase in 3D printing applications.\n• Pulsed laser sales, including high power pulsed lasers, decreased due to lower demand for foil cutting and cleaning and stripping applications.\n• QCW laser sales decreased due to lower demand in general industrial applications.\n• Laser and non-laser systems sales decreased, partially offset by higher demand for LightWELD systems.\nOther Applications\nSales from other applications decreased due to decreased demand for lasers used in medical procedures and advanced applications.\nCost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales increased by $10.6 million, or 6.3%, to $179.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from\n$168.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross margin decreased to 23.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 44.1% for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. For the\nthree months\n19\nTable of Contents\nended September 30, 2024, we recorded additional inventory provisions of $29.5 million attributed to items previously considered safety stock and items that became\ntechnologically obsolete. In addition to provisions for inventory reserves, gross margin declined due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs, partially offset\nby a decrease in shipping costs and tariffs, as a percentage of sales.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense were $22.2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months\nended September 30, 2023. Increases in personnel and related expenses were fully offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization expense. As a percentage of\nsales, sales and marketing expense increased to 9.5% from 7.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $2.5 million, or 10.1%, to $27.2 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to an increase in personnel and related expenses\nas well as an increase in premises expense. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 11.7% from 8.2% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $1.7 million, or 5.5%, to $32.7 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $31.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to increases in personnel and related expenses and bad\ndebt provision. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 14.0% from 10.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\nNet loss from divestiture and sale of assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we divested our Russia operations for $51.1 million. The\ndivestiture resulted in a loss of $197.7 million.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we completed an impairment analysis of the assets in Belarus as a result\nof new EU sanctions that will limit our ability to supply laser cabinets and other mechanical components from our factory in Belarus. We recorded $26.6 million of\nimpairment of long-lived assets.\nEffect of exchange rates on net sales, gross profit and operating expenses. If exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as one year ago,\nwhich were on average euro 0.92, Russian ruble 94, Japanese yen 145 and Chinese yuan 7.24, respectively, we estimate that net sales for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 would have been $0.5 million lower, gross profit would have been $0.7 million higher and total sales and marketing, research and development,\nand general and administrative expenses would have been $0.1 million lower.\nLoss on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange transaction loss of $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a\n$0.4 million gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our European subsidiaries have certain net assets denominated in U.S. dollars, and our Chinese\nsubsidiary has certain net liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. The foreign exchange loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable\nto an appreciation of the euro as compared to the U.S. dollar.\nInterest income, net. Interest income, net was $11.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $11.6 million of income for three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The change in interest income, net was due to holding fewer short term investments in the current period as compared to the prior\nyear.\nProvision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $8.9 million benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.8 million\nexpense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates were 3.7% and 18.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to a decrease of income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. There was a net discrete tax detriment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related\nprimarily to $41.5 million losses not benefitted from the loss on divestiture of the Russian operations. The other discrete tax items for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 did not have a significant effect on our tax rate. The discrete detriment for the three months ended September 30, 2023 did not have a significant\neffect on our tax rate.\nNet (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation. Net (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation decreased by $288.6 million to a net\nloss of $233.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net income of $55.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due\nto the factors described above.\n20\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNet sales. Net sales decreased by $245.7 million, or 24.9% to $742.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $988.5 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nThe table below sets forth sales by application:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nSales by Application % of Total % of Total\nMaterials processing $ 659,201 88.7 % $ 892,379 90.3 % $ (233,178) (26.1)%\nOther applications 83,596 11.3 % 96,167 9.7 % (12,571) (13.1)%\nTotal $ 742,797 100.0 % $ 988,546 100.0 % $ (245,749) (24.9)%\nThe table below sets forth sales by type of product and other revenue:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(In thousands, except for percentages)\nSales by Product % of Total % of Total\nHigh Power CW Lasers $ 254,343 34.2 % $ 419,538 42.4 % $ (165,195) (39.4)%\nMedium Power CW Lasers 47,082 6.3 % 57,146 5.8 % (10,064) (17.6)%\nPulsed Lasers 110,825 14.9 % 150,569 15.2 % (39,744) (26.4)%\nQCW Lasers 36,520 4.9 % 35,978 3.6 % 542 1.5 %\nLaser and Non-Laser Systems 111,436 15.0 % 117,064 11.9 % (5,628) (4.8)%\nOther Revenue including Amplifiers, Service, Parts,\nAccessories and Change in Deferred Revenue 182,591 24.7 % 208,251 21.1 % (25,660) (12.3)%\nTotal $ 742,797 100.0 % $ 988,546 100.0 % $ (245,749) (24.9)%\nMaterials processing\nSales for materials processing applications decreased due to decreases in sales of high power CW lasers, medium power CW lasers, pulsed lasers, laser and\nnon-laser systems and other laser products and service.\n• High power CW laser sales decreased due to lower sales for cutting and welding applications.

Cost of sales decreased by $66.0 million, or 11.8%, to $495.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from\n$561.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross margin decreased to 33.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 43.2% for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin decreased mainly driven by increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, we recorded additional inventory provisions of $29.5 million attributed to items previously considered safety stock and items that became\ntechnologically obsolete. In addition to provisions for inventory reserves, gross margin declined due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs, partially offset\nby a decrease in shipping costs and tariffs, as a percentage of sales.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $4.2 million, or 6.6%, to $67.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared with $63.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to higher personnel and related expenses and premises expenses,\npartially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 9.1% from 6.4% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $13.0 million, or 18.3%, to $84.0 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $71.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to higher personnel and related expenses and\npremises expenses. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 11.3% from 7.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $4.7 million, or 5.2%, to $95.4 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $90.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of increases in consultant, legal, and information system\nexpenses. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 12.8% from 9.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nNet loss from divestiture and sale of assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we incurred a net loss of $190.2 million. The loss was primarily\nrelated to the divestiture of our Russian operations for $197.7 million, partially offset by a gain on sale of assets of $7.5 million related to the sales of a building and\nland in the U.S. and a building in the U.K.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed an impairment analysis of the assets in Belarus as a result of\nnew EU sanctions that will limit our ability to supply laser cabinets and other mechanical components from our factory in Belarus. We recorded $26.6 million of\nimpairment of long-lived asset.\nEffect of exchange rates on net sales, gross profit and operating expenses. We estimate that, if exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as\none year ago, which were on average euro 0.92, Russian ruble 83, Japanese yen 138 and Chinese yuan 7.03, respectively, we would have expected net sales for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 to be $13.2 million higher, gross profit to be $8.2 million higher and total sales and marketing, research and development,\nand general and administrative expenses would have been $2.9 million higher.\nLoss on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange transaction loss of $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a\ngain of $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our European subsidiaries have certain net assets denominated in U.S. dollars, and our Chinese\nsubsidiary has certain net liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. The loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to loss from the\ndepreciation of the Chinese yuan for most of the year and appreciation of the euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar.\nInterest income, net. Interest income, net, was $38.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $28.4 million of income for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income, net, was due to an increase in yields on cash equivalents and short-term investments that\nresulted from higher market interest rates as compared to prior year rates.\nProvision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $55.3 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. There was tax expense provided on the Loss before provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe effective tax rate was 23.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to a decrease of income before\nprovision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was a tax detriment of\n$41.5 million primarily from the loss on divestiture of Russian operations for the nine months ended\n22\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, 2024. The other discrete tax items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $1.4 million tax detriment primarily related to the increase in\ntax expense for equity-based compensation which was partially offset by the reductions in tax reserves. The discrete detriment for the nine months ended September\n2023 did not have a significant effect on our tax rate.\nNet (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation. Net (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation decreased by $366.8 million to a net\nloss of $189.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net income of $177.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\ndue to the factors described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit provide us with\nthe financial flexibility to meet our liquidity and capital needs. We expect to continue making investments in capital expenditures, to assess acquisition opportunities\nand to repurchase shares of our stock in accordance with our repurchase program. The extent and timing of such expenditures may vary from period to period. Our\nfuture long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors including our level of sales, the impact of the economic environment on our growth, the timing\nand extent of spending to support development efforts, expansion of global sales and marketing activities, government regulation including trade sanctions, the\ntiming and introductions of new products, the need to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the\nnear term, we will incur capital expenditures related to the expansion of capacity outside of Russia and Belarus. As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance\nsheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations,\nliquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nIncluded in cash and cash equivalents are $5.8 million of cash located in Belarus, as of September 30, 2024.\nThe following table presents our principal sources of liquidity:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 883,871 $ 514,674\nShort-term investments 135,444 662,807\nUnused credit lines and overdraft facilities 78,755 78,506\nWorking capital (excluding cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments) 356,917 522,312\nShort-term investments at September 30, 2024 consist of liquid investments including commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury and agency\nobligations and term deposits with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year.

At September 30, 2024, there were no amounts drawn on this line;\nhowever, there were $1.6 million of guarantees issued against the line which reduces total availability.\n(3) At September 30, 2024, there were no drawings.\nAt September 30, 2024, our committed credit line is with Bank of America N.A. in the amount of $75.0 million and it is not syndicated. We are required to\nmeet certain financial covenants associated with this credit line. These covenants, tested quarterly, include an interest coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") ratio. The interest coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve-month ratio of\nEBITDA to interest on all obligations that is at least 3.0:1.0. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a\nconsolidated basis be less than three times our trailing twelve months EBITDA. Funded debt is decreased by our cash and available marketable securities not\nclassified as long-term investments in the U.S.A. in excess of $50 million up to a maximum of $500 million. We were in compliance with all such financial\ncovenants as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to not make or to delay investments and actions that we might otherwise undertake because of\nlimits on capital expenditures and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in default\nunder the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt or a reduction in available liquidity, any of\nwhich could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nSee Note 10, \"Financing Arrangements\" in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information about our facilities.\nThe following table presents cash flow activities:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nCash provided by operating activities $ 174,112 $ 189,924\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities 471,279 (162,996)\nCash used in financing activities (284,609) (175,991)\nOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $15.8 million to $174.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nfrom $189.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in sales, partially offset by an increase in cash provided by working\ncapital. Our largest working capital items typically are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory because of the\namount of value added within IPG due to our vertically integrated structure. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes\npayable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2024 primarily resulted from:\n• a decrease in cash provided by net income after adjusting for non-cash operating activities, mainly due to lower sales; and\n24\nTable of Contents\n• an increase in cash used by income and other taxes payable due to the timing of estimated tax payments made and refunds received from filing tax\nreturns, including an installment due on our transition tax liability from the Tax Reform Act of 2017.\nThe decreases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by:\n• an increase in cash provided by accounts receivable due to timing of collection and lower accounts receivable resulting from lower sales;\n• an increase in cash provided by inventory, as we moderate investment in safety stock related to supply chain disruptions for third party electronic parts\nand internally manufactured components and reduce inventory levels;\n• an increase in cash provided by accounts payable due to timing of payments;\n• a decrease in cash used by accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on custom systems\nand less cash used for personnel accruals, partially offset by an increase in cash used by customer deposits and deferred revenue due to lower sales; and\n• a decrease in cash used by prepaid expenses and other assets due to timing of bank acceptance drafts and costs and earnings in excess of billings on\ncustom systems.\nInvesting activities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $471.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash used in\ninvesting activities of $163.0 million in 2023. The cash provided by investing activities in 2024 related to $543.0 million of net proceeds of short-term investments\nand $28.5 million of cash provided by sales of property, plant and equipment; partially offset by $75.4 million of cash used for capital expenditures, and $25.3\nmillion of net cash outflow from the divestiture of our Russian operation. The cash proceeds from the sale of our Russian operation were lower than the cash and\ncash equivalents on hand, resulting in a cash outflow from divestiture. The cash used in investing activities in 2023 related to $108.6 million of net purchases of\nshort-term investments and $85.3 million of cash used for capital expenditures; partially offset by $30.4 million of cash provided by sales of property, plant and\nequipment.\nIn 2024, we expect to invest approximately $100 million net of proceeds from sale of fixed assets. Capital expenditures include investments in property,\nfacilities and equipment to replace capacity in Russia and upgrade or replace equipment at other facilities that is beyond its useful life. Capital expenditures also\ninclude investments to increase vertical integration, increase redundant manufacturing capacity for critical components and enhance research and development\ncapabilities. The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. If we obtain financing for\ncertain projects, our cash expenditures would be reduced in the year of expenditure. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times\nand are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period. We intend to finance our capital expenditures with existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments as\nwell as with cash generated from operations.\nFinancing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $284.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash used of\n$176.0 million in 2023. The cash used in financing activities in 2024 primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $286.5 million. The cash used in financing\nactivities in 2023 primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $159.5 million and principal payments on our long-term borrowings of $16.0 million.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and we intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. For this\npurpose, any statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q except for historical information are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the\ngenerality of the foregoing, words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" or \"continue\" or the negative or other\nvariations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future\nfinancial performance, trends in our businesses, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations of our management based on available information and involve a number of\nrisks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult or impossible to accurately predict and many of which are beyond our control. As such, our actual results may differ\nsignificantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those\ndiscussed in more detail in Item 1, \"Business\" and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" of Part I of the Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the\n\"Annual Report\"). Readers should carefully review these risks, as well as the additional risks described in other documents we file from time to time with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. In light of the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information included herein, the inclusion of\nsuch information should not be\n25\nTable of Contents\nregarded as a representation by us or any other person that such results will be achieved, and readers are cautioned not to rely on such forward-looking information.\nWe undertake no obligation to revise the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the\noccurrence of unanticipated events.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective\ndates of adoption or expected adoption and effects on our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents\nand foreign exchange rate risk.\nInterest rate risk. Certain interest rates are variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Our investments have limited exposure to market risk. We\nmaintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit,\ncommercial paper, corporate bonds and U.S treasury and agency obligations. None of these investments have a maturity date in excess of one year. Because of the\nshort-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results\nof operations.\nWe are also exposed to market risk as a result of increases or decreases in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our borrowings on our bank credit\nfacilities. Although our U.S. revolving line of credit have variable rates, we do not believe that a 10% change in market interest rates would have a material impact on\nour financial position or results of operations.\nExchange rates. Due to our international operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, the Russian ruble, and the Chinese yuan. Changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar versus the functional\ncurrencies of our subsidiaries affect the translated value and relative level of sales and net income that we report from one period to the next. In addition, our\nsubsidiaries may have assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency which results in foreign exchange transaction gains and\nlosses due to changes in the value of the functional currency versus the currency the assets and liabilities are denominated in. The loss on foreign exchange\ntransactions totaled $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nManagement attempts to minimize these exposures by partially or fully off-setting foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at our subsidiaries that operate\nin different functional currencies. The effectiveness of this strategy can be limited by the volume of underlying transactions at various subsidiaries and by our ability\nto accelerate or delay inter-company cash settlements. As a result, we are unable to create a perfect offset of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.\nAs a result of the divestiture of our Russian operation, our exposure to the Russian ruble in future periods is not expected to be significant.\nAt September 30, 2024, our material foreign currency exposure is net U.S. dollar denominated assets at subsidiaries where the euro is the functional currency\nand U.S. dollar denominated liabilities where the Chinese yuan is the functional currency. The net U.S. dollar denominated assets are comprised of cash, third party\nreceivables and inter-company receivables offset by third party and inter-company payables denominated in U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar denominated liabilities are\ncomprised of inter-company payables. A 5% change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the euro as of September 30, 2024 applied to the net U.S. dollar\nasset balances, would result in a foreign exchange gain of $3.7 million if the U.S. dollar appreciated and a $3.9 million foreign exchange loss if the U.S. dollar\ndepreciated. A 5% change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Chinese yuan as of September 30, 2024 applied to the net U.S. dollar liabilities\nbalances, would result in a foreign exchange loss of $0.8 million if the U.S. dollar appreciated and a $0.8 million foreign exchange gain if the U.S. dollar depreciated.\nIn addition, we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk for those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar as changes in the value of\ntheir functional currency relative to the U.S. dollar affect the translated amounts of our assets and liabilities. Changes in the translated value of assets and liabilities\ndue to changes in functional currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar result in foreign currency translation adjustments that are a component of other\ncomprehensive income or loss on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nForeign currency derivative instruments can also be used to hedge exposures and reduce the risks of certain foreign currency transactions; however, these\ninstruments provide only limited protection and can carry significant cost. We have no foreign currency derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024. We will\ncontinue to analyze our exposure to currency\n26\nTable of Contents\nexchange rate fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations. Exchange\nrate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation\nof our \"disclosure controls and procedures\" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n\"Exchange Act\")), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the \"Evaluation Date\"). Based upon that evaluation, our chief\nexecutive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that\noccurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n27\nTable of Contents\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nInformation with respect to this item may be found in Note 11, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Item 1A of Part I of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or\ncash flows, or cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. We may also face other risks and uncertainties that\nare not presently known, are not currently believed to be material, or are not identified in our Annual Report or Quarterly Reports because they are common to all\nbusinesses.\nITEM 2.
