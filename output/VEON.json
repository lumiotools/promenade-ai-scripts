(Nasdaq: VEON), a global digital operator, is pleased to note the launch of an open-source Kazakh-language large language model (Kaz-LLM), developed by a consortium coordinated by the Ministry of Digital, Innovations, and Aerospace Industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The development of Kaz-LLM was led by the Institute of Smart Systems and Artificial Intelligence at the Nazarbayev University (ISSAI NU) of Kazakhstan, in partnership with VEON’s QazCode, Beeline Kazakhstan and the Astana Hub.\n\nWith over 150 billion tokens collected, curated, synthesized and translated, the Kaz-LLM is capable of interacting in Kazakh language as well as in Turkish, English and Russian. With an 8 billion and a 70 billion parameter versions, the Kaz-LLM, developed in Kazakhstan, will help accelerate the creation and adoption of AI-powered products and services in the country. The model has been published on the Hugging Face platform for developers, ahead of its full launch.\n\nThe initiative, in which VEON’s QazCode is the only private sector partner, aligns closely with VEON’s mission to provide speakers of low-resource languages with augmented intelligence tools to enhance their daily lives, starting with Kazakhstan, VEON’s most advanced market in terms of augmented intelligence capabilities.\n\n“The launch of the open-source Kaz-LLM represents a pivotal step forward in the development of Kazakhstan’s AI ecosystem. This initiative reflects our unwavering commitment to fostering innovation and advancing scientific endeavors that drive technological progress. I am confident that this groundbreaking model will help bridge the digital divide, bringing accessible and inclusive digital services to every Kazakhstani, regardless of their native language,” **said Zhaslan Madiyev, Minister of Digital, Innovations & Aerospace of the Republic of Kazakhstan**.\n\n“AI, augmented Intelligence, has immense potential to amplify and augment human skills and capabilities; empowering doctors to deliver better care, teachers to inspire deeper learning, farmers to optimize yields, and students to excel. Yet, AI has a bias towards high-resource languages with greater digital representation. Operating in markets where national languages are not rich in digital research libraries, VEON is uniquely positioned to bridge this linguistic gap, ensuring that the half a billion people in our markets enjoy equal opportunities in the digital age. I warmly congratulate the Republic of Kazakhstan on the launch of Kaz-LLM. It is a privilege to have contributed to this landmark achievement through Beeline Kazakhstan and QazCode. We look forward to sharing these learnings globally and advancing inclusivity in AI,” **said Kaan Terzioglu, CEO of VEON Group**.\n\n\"We are delighted have partnered with Kazakhstan’s leading research institutions for the development of Kaz-LLM. Our data science professionals and developers have brought in all the experience of Beeline Kazakhstan and QazCode in developing AI-based products into this joint national project. This major undertaking will benefit the entire digital ecosystem of Kazakhstan, ensuring that the country is among the leaders of augmented intelligence. It will also be a first for us at VEON Group, in line with our focus on addressing the AI language gap for the benefit of billions of speakers of low-resource languages,” **said Alexey Sharavar, CEO of QazCode**.\n\nBeeline Kazakhstan and QazCode have already launched several AI products developed in-house, including the open-source LLM Kaz-RoBERTA-conversational model, which was the first Kazakh-language AI model with 2 billion parameters. Kaz-RoBERTA-conversational is currently used for customer service interactions on Beeline Kazakhstan’s digital platforms and is an open-source model that has been downloaded over three thousand times on the Hugging Face platform.\n\nBeeline Kazakhstan and QazCode are also actively involved in contributing to international know-how on LLM development for low-resource languages. QazCode cooperates with the GSMA Foundry and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which has developed an LLM for the Catalan language, for sharing of expertise on LLM development. \n\n**About ISSAI** Institute of Smart Systems and Artificial Intelligence (ISSAI) was founded in September 2019 to serve as the driver of research and innovation in the digital sphere of Kazakhstan with the focus on AI research. ISSAI provides an agile framework for research, innovation and collaboration with national and international partners in education, industry and government and contributes to the digital ecosystem of Kazakhstan in the advancement of national development goals.\n\n**About Beeline Kazakhstan and QazCode** Beeline Kazakhstan serves 11 million customers with mobile connectivity and two million with fixed internet services. Since 2018, the company has been executing its digital operator strategy. Over the past five years, leveraging its expertise in digital solution development, Beeline has created an ecosystem of 60 internal and external products, and serves a total monthly active user base of 11.6 million with its digital products as of June 2024.

(Nasdaq: VEON), a global digital operator (“VEON” or the “Company”), announces that it is entering into a strategic partnership with Engro Corporation Limited (“Engro Corp”) with respect to the pooling and management of its infrastructure assets, starting in Pakistan.\n\nIn the first phase of the partnership, VEON’s infrastructure assets housed under Deodar (Private) Limited (“Deodar”), a VEON Group company wholly owned by VEON through its subsidiary PMCL, will vest into Engro Corp’s subsidiary, Engro Connect, via a scheme of arrangement. VEON’s digital operator Jazz will continue to lease Deodar’s extensive infrastructure for the provision of nationwide mobile voice and data services under a long-term partnership agreement. \n\n![](/fileadmin/_processed_/9/3/csm_Veon_Engro_0fcdd18098.jpg)\n\n _Kaan Terzioglu, Group CEO of VEON and Chairman of Jazz Board, and Abdul Samad Dawood, Director of Engro Corp, signed the strategic partnership in Dubai, UAE, in the presence of Augie K Fabela II, VEON Chairman and Founder, Hussain Dawood, Chairman of Engro Corp, and Aamir Ibrahim, CEO of Jazz, along with their respective teams._\n\nThe partnership marks a significant milestone in VEON's asset-light strategy, aimed at increasing the Company’s focus on the development of services-focused businesses in line with VEON’s digital operator model. The arrangement is subject to the customary legal and regulatory approvals in Pakistan. As part of the arrangement, Engro will pay Jazz an amount of approximately USD 188 million and will guarantee the repayment of Deodar’s intercompany debt in the amount of USD 375 million.\n\n\"This strategic partnership is a pivotal move in advancing VEON's asset-light strategy. The traditional vertically integrated telco model is no longer viable for operators, neither is it conducive to the sustainable growth of developing economies. Our collaboration with Engro Corp, starting in Pakistan, our largest market, will empower Jazz to focus on innovative digital services and cutting-edge technologies that serve Pakistan’s digital ambition. It will also help VEON showcase the wide range of opportunities for shareholder value creation and new business models across our markets,\" **said Kaan Terzioglu, VEON Group CEO and Chairman of Jazz Board**.\n\n“This deal reflects Engro’s continued passion to address pressing issues through impactful infrastructure – in particular by enabling low-cost, high-quality connectivity, which is a cornerstone of progress. This partnership will benefit the broader telecom ecosystem in Pakistan: By utilizing Engro’s infrastructure, all players in the telecommunications ecosystem can focus on delivering enhanced services and expanding coverage. The wider capability that will emerge out of this partnership will help us empower communities through better and more affordable connectivity, while contributing to the broader digital transformation in Pakistan and beyond” **said Abdul Samad Dawood, Director of Engro Corporation**.\n\n**About Engro Corporation Limited** Engro Corporation is a diversified Pakistani conglomerate that strives to solve pressing issues through its portfolio of businesses. It has developed businesses across the verticals of energy and related infrastructure, petrochemicals, food and agriculture, telecommunication infrastructure, and international trading, over a period of 50+ years.

Current income tax is the expected tax expense,\npayable or receivable on taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting\ndate, and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. Deferred income tax is the tax asset or\nliability resulting from a difference in income recognition between enacted or substantively enacted local tax law and group IFRS\naccounting.\nIncome tax expense consisted of the following for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30:\nNine-month period Three-month period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCurrent income taxes (196) (204) (49) (63)\nDeferred income taxes 35 88 (18) 10\nIncome taxes (161) (116) (67) (53)\nEffective tax rate 29.0 % 28.4 % 22.8 % 28.8 %\nThe difference between the statutory tax rate in the Netherlands (25.8%) and the effective corporate income tax rate for the\nGroup in the nine and three-month periods ending September 30, 2024 (29.0% and 22.8%, respectively) was primarily driven by\na number of non-deductible expenses of US$22 incurred by the Group in various countries, as well as withholding taxes on\ndividends from our operating companies of US$36, and a change in deferred tax assets which have not been recognized by\nUS$36.\nThe difference between the statutory tax rate in the Netherlands (25.8%) and the effective corporate income tax rate for the\nGroup in the nine and three-month periods ending September 30, 2023 (28.4% and 28.8%, respectively) was primarily driven by\na number of non-deductible expenses of US$38 incurred by the Group in various countries, which are recorded in our condensed\nconsolidated income statement and withholding taxes accrued for forecasted dividends from our operating companies of US$28.\nGlobal Minimum Tax\nThe Group is in scope of the enacted Pillar Two legislation and has performed an assessment of the Group’s exposure to Pillar\nTwo income taxes. The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent tax filings,\ncountry-by-country reporting and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment, the\nPillar Two effective tax rates in majority of jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15%. However, there are a limited\nnumber of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief does not apply and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to\n15%. The Group does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes in those jurisdictions.\nThe Group has accumulated US$9,785 of tax losses and US$130 of other tax attributes in various jurisdictions which can be\ntaken into account for Pillar Two purposes.\nThe Group has applied the International Accounting Standards (\"IAS\") 12 exception to recognizing and disclosing information\nabout deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\nVEON Ltd | Unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024 14\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES OF THE GROUP\n4 SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024\nVEON announces sale of stake in Beeline Kyrgyzstan\nOn March 26, 2024, VEON announced that it signed a share purchase agreement (\"Kyrgyzstan SPA\") for the sale of its 50.1%\nindirect stake in Beeline Kyrgyzstan to CG Cell Technologies, which is wholly owned by CG Corp Global for cash consideration\nof US$32. Completion of the sale of VEON’s stake in Beeline Kyrgyzstan, which is held by VIP Kyrgyzstan Holding AG (an\nindirect subsidiary of the Company), is subject to customary regulatory approvals and preemption right of the Government of\nKyrgyzstan in relation to acquisition of the stake. VEON is currently liaising with Kyrgyzstan public authorities regarding the\nregulatory approvals and the Government’s preemption right.\nAs a result of this anticipated transaction and assessment that control of the Kyrgyzstan operations will be transferred, as from\nthe date of the Kyrgyzstan SPA signing, the Company classified its Kyrgyzstan operations as held for sale. Following the\nclassification as held for sale, the Company no longer accounts for depreciation and amortization for Kyrgyzstan operations.\nRefer to Note 5 for the detailed breakdown of the assets and liabilities held for sale relating to the Kyrgyzstan operations.\nSale of TNS+ in Kazakhstan\nOn May 28, 2024, VEON announced that it signed a share purchase agreement (\"TNS+ SPA\") for the sale of its 49% stake in\nKazakh wholesale telecommunications infrastructure services provider, TNS Plus LLP (\"TNS+\"), included within the Kazakhstan\noperating segment, to its joint venture partner, the DAR group of companies for total deferred consideration of US$138. As a\nresult of this anticipated transaction and assessment that control of TNS+ will be transferred, as from the date of the TNS+ SPA\nsigning, the Company classified its TNS+ operations as held for sale and thereafter, the Company no longer accounted for\ndepreciation and amortization for TNS+ operations. The closing of the transaction was subject to customary regulatory approvals\nin Kazakhstan which were subsequently obtained. Accordingly, the sale was completed on September 30, 2024 and the\nCompany recognized a US$66 gain on disposal of TNS+, which includes the recycling of currency translation reserve in the\namount of US$44.

Refer to Note 5 for the detailed breakdown of the result of the\ndisposal of TNS+.\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023\nSignificant movements in exchange rates\nAn increase in demand for hard currencies, in part due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine (refer to Note 15) and\nother macroeconomic conditions, resulted in the devaluation of exchange rates in the countries in which VEON operates,\nparticularly in Pakistan and Russia. As such, in the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, the book value of assets and\nliabilities of our foreign operations, in U.S. dollar terms, decreased significantly, with a corresponding loss of US$559 recorded\nagainst the foreign currency translation reserve in the interim condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nVEON Ltd | Unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024 15\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\n5 HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nDuring nine-month period ended September 30, 2024\nAs disclosed in Note 4, the following table provides the details of the Kyrgyzstan assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale\nas of September 30, 2024:\nKyrgyzstan\nNon-current assets\nProperty and equipment 32\nIntangible assets excl. goodwill 8\nOther non-current assets 3\nOther current assets\nInventories 1\nTrade and other receivables 5\nCash and cash equivalents 12\nOther current assets 4\nTotal assets held for sale 65\nNon-current liabilities\nDebt and Derivatives 6\nOther non-current liabilities 1\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables 10\nOther non-financial liabilities 7\nTotal liabilities held for sale 24\nSale of stake in Beeline Kyrgyzstan\nNet assets of the held for sale operations of Kyrgyzstan include US$98 of cumulative currency translation losses as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, which is accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income and will be recycled through the\nconsolidated income statement upon the completion of the sale.\nThe fair value less cost of disposal (“FVLCD”) for the Kyrgyzstan operations as of September 30, 2024 was based on the sales\nconsideration as reflected in the SPA signed on March 26, 2024 (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). The fair value represented\nby the SPA exceeded the carrying value of the Kyrgyzstan CGU as of September 30, 2024, therefore no impairment was\nrecorded.

Under the SPA, the consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294 on October 9, 2023), was expected to\nbe settled primarily by VimpelCom taking on and discharging certain VEON Holdings B.V.’s debt, thus significantly deleveraging\nVEON’s balance sheet. The SPA contained provisions amongst others that in the event VimpelCom acquires VEON Holdings\nB.V.’s debt in excess of the sales consideration, VEON will work with the purchasers to satisfy its obligations to them as a\nbondholder. The transaction was subject to certain closing conditions including the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals and\nlicenses from relevant government authorities in Russia and Western jurisdictions (the United States, the United Kingdom, the\nEuropean Union, and Bermuda) for the proposed structure of the sale.\nOn November 24, 2022, the signing date of the SPA, the Company classified its Russian operations as a disposal group held-for-\nsale and discontinued operations. Following the classification as disposal group held-for-sale, the Company did not account for\ndepreciation and amortization expenses of Russia’s assets.\nOn September 13, 2023, VEON agreed with the buyer, owned by certain senior members of VimpelCom’s management team,\namendments to the SPA, which had no material impact on the economic terms of the original transaction announced on\nNovember 24, 2022. With the amendments to the sale agreement, the entire consideration for the sale was agreed to be\nsatisfied by transferring the agreed value of VEON Holdings bonds acquired by VimpelCom to a wholly owned subsidiary of\nVEON Holdings (Unitel LLC) on or prior to the closing of the sale, which will hold such notes until their cancellation or maturity.\nU.S. and other regulatory approvals were received for the transfer of approximately 95% of such VEON Holdings bonds. The\nremaining VEON Holdings bonds will be transferred as soon as the outstanding regulatory approval have been obtained. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, US$274 of VEON Holdings bonds were transferred to Unitel LLC from VimpelCom.\nOn October 9, 2023, VEON announced the completion of its exit from Russia with closing of the sale of its Russian operations.\nUpon completion of the sale, control of VimpelCom was transferred to the buyer, and accordingly, a loss of US$3.7 billion\nrecorded within “Profit / (loss) after Tax from Discontinued Operations” in the Consolidated Income Statement was recognized,\nprimarily due to US$3.4 billion of cumulative currency translation losses which accumulated in equity through other\ncomprehensive income and recycled through the consolidated income statement on the date of the disposal.

The Company considers, amongst other things, the relationship between its market capitalization and its book\nvalue, as well as the weighted average cost of capital and the quarterly financial performances of each cash-generating unit\n(\"CGU\") when reviewing for indicators of impairment in interim periods. Refer to the table above for an overview of the carrying\nvalue of goodwill per CGU.\nVEON performed its annual impairment testing at September 30, 2024.

The term \"income statement\" as used in these financial statements is considered interchangeable with the term\n\"statement of profit and loss\" as defined in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual\nconsolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s audited annual consolidated financial\nstatements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCertain comparative amounts have been reclassified in this interim condensed consolidated income statement and the\nconsolidated statement of cash flows as follows:\n• On the interim condensed consolidated income statement: revenue relating to business-to-business activities of US$14\nand US$5 was classified from “Other revenue” to “Service revenues” for the nine and three-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThe preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements has required management to apply accounting\npolicies and methodologies based on complex and subjective judgments, estimates based on past experience and assumptions\ndetermined to be reasonable and realistic based on the related circumstances. The use of these judgments, estimates and\nassumptions affects the amounts reported in the statement of financial position, income statement, statement of cash flows,\nstatement of changes in equity, as well as the notes. The final amounts for items for which estimates and assumptions were\nmade in the consolidated financial statements may differ from those reported in these statements due to the uncertainties that\ncharacterize the assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based.\nGoing Concern\nAs of December 13, 2024, hostilities continue in Ukraine. Currently, we have 24 million subscribers in Ukraine, where they are\nsupported by 4,000 employees. VEON’s priority is to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. We\nhave developed and, in some cases, implemented additional contingency plans to relocate work and/or personnel to other\ngeographies and add new locations, as appropriate. As of December 13, 2024, most of our Ukraine subsidiary’s employees\nremain in the country. As of December 13, 2024, millions of people have fled Ukraine and the country has sustained significant\ndamage to infrastructure and assets.\nThe war has resulted in events and conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern. Except as explicitly detailed below, the events and conditions impacting the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern continue to be the same as those disclosed in the 2023 Form 20-F:\n• We may need to record future impairment charges in Ukraine or CGUs, which could be material, if the war continues or\nescalates and/or due to macroeconomic conditions.\n• Based on the current state of affairs, the Company currently has sufficient liquidity to satisfy our current obligations at\nleast over the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements without the need of additional financing\nassuming no early repayments of our long-term debt. Cash on hand was US$1,176 as of October 31, 2024 after the full\nrepayment of the RCF (refer to details in Note 1). As a result of the full repayment and cancellation of the RCF, the\nCompany no longer has any financial covenants. However, these continue to be uncertain times and it is not possible to\npredict with certainty how certain developments will impact our liquidity position, non-financial provisions in our debt\nagreements, and our equity levels on a regular and continuous basis both at the group and operating company levels.\nWe may also be impacted by conditions or local legal requirements in international markets that could make it more\ndifficult to service our existing debt obligations or refinance existing debt. If the assumptions behind our liquidity forecast\nare not correct, we may not have sufficient liquidity to continue to operate as outlined above. If we are unable to raise\nadditional capital in the markets in which we seek to raise it, or at all, or if the cost of raising additional capital\nsignificantly increases, which has been the case since the onset of the ongoing war due to monetary policy in response\nto global inflationary pressures and a number of other factors, we may be unable to make necessary or desired capital\nexpenditures, take advantage of investment opportunities, refinance existing indebtedness or meet unexpected financial\nrequirements, and our growth strategy and liquidity may be negatively affected. This could cause us to be unable to\nrepay indebtedness as it comes due, to delay or abandon anticipated expenditures and investments or otherwise limit\noperations. For example, the ongoing war in Ukraine has caused us to reconsider our capital outlay to ensure we have\nsufficient liquidity for maintenance capital expenditures and other key operational spend while at the same time\nservicing our indebtedness. As a result, capital expenditures that are more discretionary in nature may be put on hold\nVEON Ltd | Unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024 32\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\nuntil the impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine, and particularly its effects on our liquidity and financial profile, becomes\nmore certain.\n• As of December 13, 2024, the Company continues to conclude that neither VEON Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries is\ntargeted by sanctions imposed by any of the United States, European Union (and individual EU member states) and the\nUnited Kingdom. However, the interpretation and enforcement of these new sanctions and counter-sanctions may result\nin unanticipated outcomes and could give rise to material uncertainties, which could complicate our business decisions.\nFor example, to protect U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, the U.S. government has broad discretion to\nat times impose a broad range of extraterritorial “secondary” sanctions under which non-U.S. persons carrying out\ncertain activities may be penalized or designated as sanctioned parties, even if the activities have no ties, contact with,\nor nexus to the United States or the U.S. financial system at all. These secondary sanctions could be imposed on the\nCompany or any of the Company’s subsidiaries if they were to engage in activity that the U.S. government determined\nwas undertaken knowingly and rose to the level of material or significant support to, for, or on behalf of certain\nsanctioned parties.\n• Ukraine has also implemented and may implement further sanctions or measures on individuals or entities with close\nties to Russia, which may negatively impact Kyivstar if VEON is considered by local Ukrainian authorities as being a\ncompany controlled by sanctioned persons. In October 2023, VEON received notification from its local custodian that\nthe following percentages of the corporate rights in our Ukrainian subsidiaries had been frozen: (i) 47.85% of Kyivstar,\n(ii) 100% of Ukraine Tower Company, (iii) 100% of Kyivstar.Tech, and (iv) 69.99% of Helsi Ukraine. On November 29,\n2024, the Shevchenkivskyi District Court of Kyiv ruled in favor of a request to unfreeze 47.85% of VEON’s corporate\nrights in Kyivstar and 100% of VEON’s corporate rights in its other Ukrainian subsidiaries. The decision fully removes\nthe restrictions on VEON’s corporate rights imposed by Ukrainian courts on its wholly owned Kyivstar and other\nUkrainian subsidiaries.\n• If further measures are adopted and applied in relation to our Ukrainian subsidiary, this could lead to the involuntary\ndeconsolidation of our Ukrainian operations, and could trigger certain financial covenants or non-financial provisions in\nour debt agreements, requiring accelerated repayment, potentially triggering a cross-default across other debt\nagreements and the revolving credit facility and negatively impact our liquidity.\nManagement has taken actions to address the events and conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern. Except for the updates detailed below, the actions taken by management to address these events\nand conditions are those disclosed in the audited consolidated financial statements of VEON Ltd. as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 which were included in the 2023 Form 20-F:\n• We have implemented business continuity plans to address known contingency scenarios to ensure that we have\nadequate processes and practices in place to protect the safety of our people and to handle potential impacts to our\noperations in Ukraine.\n• Management actively monitors the Company’s liquidity position, our non-financial provisions in our debt agreements,\nand our equity levels on a regular and continuous basis both at the group and operating company levels and should\nthey reach a level considered at-risk, management will take actions to ensure our liquidity position is sufficient and our\nnon-financial provisions in our debt agreements are met.\n• On March 28, 2024, VEON announced that it repaid in full the outstanding balance of US$805 (principal, excluding\naccrued interest) and cancelled its RCF, after paying the matured portion of US$250 in February 2024.\n• Management is actively monitoring any new developments in applicable international and domestic sanctions to ensure\nthat we continue to be in compliance therewith as well as to evaluate any potential impact on the Company’s financial\nperformance, operations, and governance. Management has also actively engaged with sanctions authorities where\nappropriate. Management continues to engage with relevant local authorities in Ukraine to address any concerns they\nhave about the ownership and management of Kyivstar and to provide all necessary assurances to confirm that\nRussian nationals, including any beneficial owners of LetterOne, do not participate in the management of Kyivstar nor\nare they able to derive any benefits from VEON’s assets in Ukraine.\n• On October 30, 2023, VEON announced that two appeals were filed with the relevant Kyiv courts, challenging the\nfreezing of the corporate rights in Kyivstar and Ukraine Tower Company, noting that corporate rights in Kyivstar and\nUkraine Tower Company belong exclusively to VEON, and that their full or partial freezing or seizure directly violates the\nrights of VEON and its international debt and equity investors, and requesting the lifting of the freezing of its corporate\nrights in Kyivstar and Ukraine Tower Company. In December 2023, the court rejected the Company’s appeals. On June\n4, 2024, the CEO of VEON, in his capacity as a shareholder of VEON, filed a motion with Shevchenkivskiy District Court\nof Kyiv requesting cancellation of the freeze of corporate rights in the VEON group's subsidiary Ukraine Tower\nCompany. On June 26, 2024, the motion was supplemented to request cancellation of the freezing of corporate rights in\nthe VEON group's other Ukrainian subsidiaries: Kyivstar, Kyivstar.Tech and Helsi Ukraine. VEON continued its\nsignificant government affairs efforts to protect our assets in Ukraine. On November 29, 2024, the Shevchenkivskyi\nDistrict Court of Kyiv ruled in favor of the request to unfreeze 47.85% of VEON’s corporate rights in Kyivstar and 100%\nof VEON’s corporate rights in its other Ukrainian subsidiaries. After the successful lifting of the court freeze of Kyivstar's\nshares, VEON is working with its local custodian to remove all remaining restrictions on Kyivstar and its Ukrainian\nVEON Ltd | Unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024 33\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\nsubsidiaries corporate rights. VEON is pursing steps to meet the conditions required by the local custodian to lift the\nstipulated freeze.\n• As disclosed in Note 14, in addition to filing its 2023 Form 20-F with the SEC on October 17, 2024, the Company filed\nits 2023 Dutch Annual Report on November 1, 2024. As a result of filing the 2023 Form 20-F, the Company regained\ncompliance, which has been confirmed by NASDAQ as announced on October 21, 2024. Further, as disclosed in Note\n1, the VEON Holdings consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 were filed on November 21, 2024\nand made available to bondholders pursuant to the non-financial covenants.\n• As disclosed in Note 14, on November 13, 2024, VEON announced that the VEON Board of Directors has re-appointed\nUHY as the independent registered public accounting firm for the audit of the Group's consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended December 31, 2024 in accordance with the standards established by the PCAOB.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In accordance\nwith IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, the Company has determined that the aforementioned conditions and events,\nincluding those set out in the Company’s Form 20-F with the SEC on October 17, 2024, considered in the aggregate, may cast\nsignificant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months after the date these\nconsolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance. Management expects the actions it has taken or will take will\nmitigate the risk associated with the identified events and conditions. However, given the uncertainty and exogenous nature of\nthe ongoing conflict and potential future imposed sanctions as well as potential new counter-sanctions, and given the possible\nfuture imposition of external administration over our Russian and Ukrainian operations in particular, management concluded that\na material uncertainty remains related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern, such that it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of\nbusiness.\nAs a U.S. SEC registrant, the Company is required to have its financial statements audited in accordance with PCAOB\nstandards. References in these IFRS financial statements to matters that may cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability\nto continue as a going concern also raise substantial doubt as contemplated by the PCAOB standards.\nNEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent\nwith those followed in the preparation of the Group’s audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nA number of new and amended standards became effective as of January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact on\nVEON financial statements. The Group has not early adopted any other standards, interpretations or amendments that have\nbeen issued but have not yet become effective.\nAmsterdam, December 13, 2024\nVEON Ltd.\nVEON Ltd | Unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024 34"

Current income tax is the expected tax expense,\npayable or receivable on taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting\ndate, and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. Deferred income tax is the tax asset or\nliability resulting from a difference in income recognition between enacted or substantively enacted local tax law and group IFRS\naccounting.\nIncome tax expense consisted of the following for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30:\nNine-month period Three-month period\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCurrent income taxes (190) (199) (48) (61)\nDeferred income taxes 35 89 (18) 11\nIncome taxes (155) (110) (66) (50)\nEffective tax rate 22.0 % 21.2 % 19.4 % 23.3 %\nThe difference between the statutory tax rate in the Netherlands (25.8%) and the effective corporate income tax rate for the\nGroup in the nine and three-month periods ending September 30, 2024 (22.0% and 19.4%, respectively) was primarily driven by\na number of non-deductible expenses of US$16 incurred by the Group in various countries, as well as withholding taxes on\ndividends from our operating companies of US$36, and a non-taxable income of US$38.\nThe difference between the statutory tax rate in the Netherlands (25.8%) and the effective corporate income tax rate for the\nGroup in the nine and three-month periods ending September 30, 2023 (21.2% and 23.3%, respectively) was primarily driven by\na number of non-deductible expenses of US$35 incurred by the Group in various countries, which are recorded in our condensed\nconsolidated income statement and withholding taxes accrued for forecasted dividends from our operating companies of US$27.\nGlobal Minimum Tax\nThe Group is in scope of the enacted Pillar Two legislation and has performed an assessment of the Group’s exposure to Pillar\nTwo income taxes. The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent tax filings,\ncountry-by-country reporting and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment, the\nPillar Two effective tax rates in majority of jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15%. However, there are a limited\nnumber of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief does not apply and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to\n15%. The Group does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes in those jurisdictions.\nThe Group has accumulated US$7,234 of tax losses and US$50 of other tax attributes in various jurisdictions which can be taken\ninto account for Pillar Two purposes.\nThe Group has applied the International Accounting Standards (\"IAS\") 12 exception to recognizing and disclosing information\nabout deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\nVEON Holdings B.V. | Special purpose unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period\nended September 30, 2024 13\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES OF THE GROUP\n4 SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024\nVEON announces sale of stake in Beeline Kyrgyzstan\nOn March 26, 2024, VEON announced that it signed a share purchase agreement (\"Kyrgyzstan SPA\") for the sale of its 50.1%\nindirect stake in Beeline Kyrgyzstan to CG Cell Technologies, which is wholly owned by CG Corp Global for cash consideration\nof US$32. Completion of the sale of VEON’s stake in Beeline Kyrgyzstan, which is held by VIP Kyrgyzstan Holding AG (an\nindirect subsidiary of the Company), is subject to customary regulatory approvals and preemption right of the Government of\nKyrgyzstan in relation to acquisition of the stake. VEON is currently liaising with Kyrgyzstan public authorities regarding the\nregulatory approvals and the Government’s preemption right.\nAs a result of this anticipated transaction and assessment that control of the Kyrgyzstan operations will be transferred, as from\nthe date of the Kyrgyzstan SPA signing, the Company classified its Kyrgyzstan operations as held for sale. Following the\nclassification as held for sale, the Company no longer accounts for depreciation and amortization for Kyrgyzstan operations.\nRefer to Note 5 for the detailed breakdown of the assets and liabilities held for sale relating to the Kyrgyzstan operations.\nSale of TNS+ in Kazakhstan\nOn May 28, 2024, VEON announced that it signed a share purchase agreement (\"TNS+ SPA\") for the sale of its 49% stake in\nKazakh wholesale telecommunications infrastructure services provider, TNS Plus LLP (\"TNS+\"), included within the Kazakhstan\noperating segment, to its joint venture partner, the DAR group of companies for total deferred consideration of US$138. As a\nresult of this anticipated transaction and assessment that control of TNS+ will be transferred, as from the date of the TNS+ SPA\nsigning, the Company classified its TNS+ operations as held for sale and thereafter, the Company no longer accounted for\ndepreciation and amortization for TNS+ operations. The closing of the transaction was subject to customary regulatory approvals\nin Kazakhstan which were subsequently obtained. Accordingly, the sale was completed on September 30, 2024 and the\nCompany recognized a US$66 gain on disposal of TNS+, which includes the recycling of currency translation reserve in the\namount of US$44. In November 2024, the Company has received US$38 of the total deferred consideration and the remaining\nUS$100 is expected to be settled during the remainder of 2024. Refer to Note 5 for the detailed breakdown of the result of the\ndisposal of TNS+.\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30 2023\nSignificant movements in exchange rates\nAn increase in demand for hard currencies, in part due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine (refer to Note 14) and\nother macroeconomic conditions, resulted in the devaluation of exchange rates in the countries in which VEON operates,\nparticularly in Pakistan and Russia. As such, in the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, the book value of assets and\nliabilities of our foreign operations, in U.S. dollar terms, decreased significantly, with a corresponding loss of US$556 recorded\nagainst the foreign currency translation reserve in the interim condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nVEON Holdings B.V. | Special purpose unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period\nended September 30, 2024 14\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\n5 HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nDuring nine-month period ended September 30, 2024\nAs disclosed in Note 4, the following table provides the details of the Kyrgyzstan assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale\nas of September 30, 2024:\nKyrgyzstan\nNon-current assets\nProperty and equipment 32\nIntangible assets excl. goodwill 8\nOther non-current assets 3\nOther current assets\nInventories 1\nTrade and other receivables 5\nCash and cash equivalents 12\nOther current assets 4\nTotal assets held for sale 65\nNon-current liabilities\nDebt and Derivatives 6\nOther non-current liabilities 1\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables 10\nOther non-financial liabilities 7\nTotal liabilities held for sale 24\nSale of stake in Beeline Kyrgyzstan\nNet assets of the held for sale operations of Kyrgyzstan include US$98 of cumulative currency translation losses as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, which is accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income and will be recycled through the\nconsolidated income statement upon the completion of the sale.\nThe fair value less cost of disposal (“FVLCD”) for the Kyrgyzstan operations as of September 30, 2024 was based on the sales\nconsideration as reflected in the SPA signed on March 26, 2024 (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). The fair value represented\nby the SPA exceeded the carrying value of the Kyrgyzstan CGU as of September 30, 2024, therefore no impairment was\nrecorded. There were no triggering events indicating any impairment or decline in the fair value of Kyrgyzstan operations\nsubsequent to its measurement as held for sale.\nSale of TNS+ in Kazakhstan\nThe following table shows the results for the disposal of TNS+ that are accounted for in these financial statements as of\nSeptember 30, 2024:\n2024\nDeferred consideration to be settled in cash 138\nCarrying amount of net assets at disposal (50)\nGain on sale before reclassification of foreign currency translation reserve and non-controlling interests 88\nDerecognition of non-controlling interest 22\nReclassification of foreign currency translation reserve (44)\nGain on disposal of TNS+ 66\nVEON Holdings B.V. | Special purpose unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period\nended September 30, 2024 15\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\nDuring nine-month period ended September 30 2023\nSale of Russia operations\nOn November 24, 2022, VEON entered into the Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) to sell VEON’s Russian operations to certain\nsenior members of the management team of PJSC VimpelCom (“VimpelCom”), led by the CEO at the time, Aleksander\nTorbakhov. Under the SPA, the consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294 on October 9, 2023), was expected to\nbe settled primarily by VimpelCom taking on and discharging certain VEON Holdings B.V.’s debt, thus significantly deleveraging\nVEON’s balance sheet. The SPA contained provisions amongst others that in the event VimpelCom acquires VEON Holdings\nB.V.’s debt in excess of the sales consideration, VEON will work with the purchasers to satisfy its obligations to them as a\nbondholder. The transaction was subject to certain closing conditions including the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals and\nlicenses from relevant government authorities in Russia and Western jurisdictions (the United States, the United Kingdom, the\nEuropean Union, and Bermuda) for the proposed structure of the sale.\nOn November 24, 2022, the signing date of the SPA, the Company classified its Russian operations as a disposal group held-for-\nsale and discontinued operations. Following the classification as disposal group held-for-sale, the Company did not account for\ndepreciation and amortization expenses of Russia’s assets.\nOn September 13, 2023, VEON agreed with the buyer, owned by certain senior members of VimpelCom’s management team,\namendments to the SPA, which had no material impact on the economic terms of the original transaction announced on\nNovember 24, 2022. With the amendments to the sale agreement, the entire consideration for the sale was agreed to be\nsatisfied by transferring the agreed value of VEON Holdings bonds acquired by VimpelCom to a wholly owned subsidiary of\nVEON Holdings (Unitel LLC) on or prior to the closing of the sale, which will hold such notes until their cancellation or maturity.\nU.S. and other regulatory approvals were received for the transfer of approximately 95% of such VEON Holdings bonds. The\nremaining VEON Holdings bonds will be transferred as soon as the outstanding regulatory approval have been obtained. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, US$274 of VEON Holdings bonds were transferred to Unitel LLC from VimpelCom.\nOn October 9, 2023, VEON announced the completion of its exit from Russia with closing of the sale of its Russian operations.\nUpon completion of the sale, control of VimpelCom was transferred to the buyer, and accordingly, a loss of US$3.7 billion\nrecorded within “Profit / (loss) after Tax from Discontinued Operations” in the Consolidated Income Statement was recognized,\nprimarily due to US$3.4 billion of cumulative currency translation losses which accumulated in equity through other\ncomprehensive income and recycled through the consolidated income statement on the date of the disposal. VEON Holdings\nredeemed US$406 of these debt securities from VimpelCom following their maturity. Upon the completion of the sale, the agreed\namount of the bonds of VEON Holdings acquired by VimpelCom representing a nominal value of US$1,576 were transferred to\nUnitel LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) and offset against the purchase consideration of RUB 130 billion\n(approximately US$1,294 on October 9, 2023) on a non cash basis resulting in no impact on the cash flows. The remaining\ndeferred consideration of US$72 as of December 31, 2023 was offset against VEON Holdings bonds acquired by VimpelCom\nrepresenting an aggregate total nominal value of US$72 in July 2024 after receiving the relevant regulatory approval.\nThe following table shows the profit/(loss) and other comprehensive income relating to Russia operations for the nine-month\nperiod ended September 30 2023:\nNine-month period\nIncome statement and statement of comprehensive income 2023\nOperating revenue 2,702\nOperating expenses (1,812)\nOther expenses 3\nProfit before tax for the period 893\nIncome tax expense (83)\nProfit after tax for the period 810\nOther comprehensive loss * (386)\nTotal comprehensive income 424\n* Other comprehensive income is relating to the foreign currency translation of discontinued operations.\nVEON Holdings B.V. | Special purpose unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period\nended September 30, 2024 16\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\nRussia impairment losses 2023\nAs of June 30, 2023, VEON recorded an impairment of US$281 against the carrying value of goodwill in Russia, resulting in a\nreduced carrying value of US$168 at the reporting date of which the VEON share amounts to US$152, excluding non-controlling\ninterest.\nThe recoverable amount of the net assets held for sale of US$152 as of June 30, 2023 was determined based on the fair value\nless costs of disposal and represents the remaining portion of the sales proceeds as per SPA (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).\nThis equates to the value of the VEON bonds remaining to be purchased by PJSC VimpelCom to reach the sales consideration\nof RUB 130 billion.\nAs of September 30, 2023 the carrying value of Russian net assets amounted to US$(165) due to increased external debt. The\nVEON share of net assets amounts to US$(179), excluding non-controlling interest. The sales proceeds as per the SPA of RUB\n130 billion will be fully settled upon closing against the receivable held by PJSC VimpelCom for the VEON bonds acquired by\nPJSC VimpelCom and subsequently transferred to Unitel LLC. Therefore the recoverable amount of the net assets, being the\nremaining portion of the sales proceeds as per SPA (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) to be settled against the net assets,\namounted to nil.

Kyivstar will invest approximately UAH 1.43\nbillion (US$34) in the Ukrainian economy through this spectrum acquisition.\nUnfreezing of VEON's Corporate Rights in Ukraine\nOn November 29, 2024, VEON announced that the Shevchenkivskyi District Court of Kyiv has ruled in favor of a request to\nunfreeze 47.85% of VEON’s corporate rights in Kyivstar and 100% of VEON’s corporate rights in other Ukrainian subsidiaries\n(Ukraine Tower Company, Kyivstar Tech and Helsi). The decision fully removes the restrictions on VEON’s corporate rights\nimposed by the Ukrainian courts on our wholly owned subsidiary Kyivstar and other Ukrainian subsidiaries.\nPakistan Mobile Communication Limited (\"PMCL\") short term credit facilities\nDuring November 2024, PMCL signed new short-term facilities of PKR 84 billion (US$302) from different local banks and\nwithdrew PKR 68 billion (US$245) from these short-term facilities.

The term \"income statement\" as used in these financial statements is considered interchangeable with the term\n\"statement of profit and loss\" as defined in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual\nconsolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s audited annual consolidated financial\nstatements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCertain comparative amounts have been reclassified in this interim condensed consolidated income statement and the\nconsolidated statement of cash flows as follows:\n• On the interim condensed consolidated income statement: revenue relating to business-to-business activities of US$14\nand US$5 was classified from “Other revenue” to “Service revenues” for the nine and three-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nThe preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements has required management to apply accounting\npolicies and methodologies based on complex and subjective judgments, estimates based on past experience and assumptions\ndetermined to be reasonable and realistic based on the related circumstances. The use of these judgments, estimates and\nassumptions affects the amounts reported in the statement of financial position, income statement, statement of cash flows,\nstatement of changes in equity, as well as the notes. The final amounts for items for which estimates and assumptions were\nmade in the consolidated financial statements may differ from those reported in these statements due to the uncertainties that\ncharacterize the assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based.\nGoing Concern\nAs of December 13, 2024, hostilities continue in Ukraine. Currently, we have 24 million subscribers in Ukraine, where they are\nsupported by 4,000 employees. VEON’s priority is to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. We\nhave developed and, in some cases, implemented additional contingency plans to relocate work and/or personnel to other\ngeographies and add new locations, as appropriate. As of December 13, 2024, most of our Ukraine subsidiary’s employees\nremain in the country. As of December 13, 2024, millions of people have fled Ukraine and the country has sustained significant\ndamage to infrastructure and assets.\nThe war has resulted in events and conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern. Except as explicitly detailed below, the events and conditions impacting the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern continue to be the same as those disclosed in the 2023 consolidated financial statements:\n• We may need to record future impairment charges in Ukraine or CGUs, which could be material, if the war continues or\nescalates and/or due to macroeconomic conditions.\n• Based on the current state of affairs, the Company currently has sufficient liquidity to satisfy our current obligations at\nleast over the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements without the need of additional financing\nassuming no early repayments of our long-term debt. Cash on hand was US$1,176 as of October 31, 2024 after the full\nrepayment of the RCF (refer to details in Note 1). As a result of the full repayment and cancellation of the RCF, the\nCompany no longer has any financial covenants. However, these continue to be uncertain times and it is not possible to\npredict with certainty how certain developments will impact our liquidity position, non-financial provisions in our debt\nagreements, and our equity levels on a regular and continuous basis both at the group and operating company levels.\nWe may also be impacted by conditions or local legal requirements in international markets that could make it more\ndifficult to service our existing debt obligations or refinance existing debt. If the assumptions behind our liquidity forecast\nare not correct, we may not have sufficient liquidity to continue to operate as outlined above. If we are unable to raise\nadditional capital in the markets in which we seek to raise it, or at all, or if the cost of raising additional capital\nsignificantly increases, which has been the case since the onset of the ongoing war due to monetary policy in response\nto global inflationary pressures and a number of other factors, we may be unable to make necessary or desired capital\nexpenditures, take advantage of investment opportunities, refinance existing indebtedness or meet unexpected financial\nrequirements, and our growth strategy and liquidity may be negatively affected. This could cause us to be unable to\nrepay indebtedness as it comes due, to delay or abandon anticipated expenditures and investments or otherwise limit\noperations. For example, the ongoing war in Ukraine has caused us to reconsider our capital outlay to ensure we have\nsufficient liquidity for maintenance capital expenditures and other key operational spend while at the same time\nservicing our indebtedness. As a result, capital expenditures that are more discretionary in nature may be put on hold\nVEON Holdings B.V. | Special purpose unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period\nended September 30, 2024 32\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\nuntil the impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine, and particularly its effects on our liquidity and financial profile, becomes\nmore certain.\n• As of December 13, 2024, the Company continues to conclude that neither VEON Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries is\ntargeted by sanctions imposed by any of the United States, European Union (and individual EU member states) and the\nUnited Kingdom. However, the interpretation and enforcement of these new sanctions and counter-sanctions may result\nin unanticipated outcomes and could give rise to material uncertainties, which could complicate our business decisions.\nFor example, to protect U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, the U.S. government has broad discretion to\nat times impose a broad range of extraterritorial “secondary” sanctions under which non-U.S. persons carrying out\ncertain activities may be penalized or designated as sanctioned parties, even if the activities have no ties, contact with,\nor nexus to the United States or the U.S. financial system at all. These secondary sanctions could be imposed on the\nCompany or any of the Company’s subsidiaries if they were to engage in activity that the U.S. government determined\nwas undertaken knowingly and rose to the level of material or significant support to, for, or on behalf of certain\nsanctioned parties.\n• Ukraine has also implemented and may implement further sanctions or measures on individuals or entities with close\nties to Russia, which may negatively impact Kyivstar if VEON is considered by local Ukrainian authorities as being a\ncompany controlled by sanctioned persons. In October 2023, VEON received notification from its local custodian that\nthe following percentages of the corporate rights in our Ukrainian subsidiaries had been frozen: (i) 47.85% of Kyivstar,\n(ii) 100% of Ukraine Tower Company, (iii) 100% of Kyivstar.Tech, and (iv) 69.99% of Helsi Ukraine. On November 29,\n2024, the Shevchenkivskyi District Court of Kyiv ruled in favor of a request to unfreeze 47.85% of VEON’s corporate\nrights in Kyivstar and 100% of VEON’s corporate rights in its other Ukrainian subsidiaries. The decision fully removes\nthe restrictions on VEON’s corporate rights imposed by Ukrainian courts on its wholly owned Kyivstar and other\nUkrainian subsidiaries.\n• If further measures are adopted and applied in relation to our Ukrainian subsidiary, this could lead to the involuntary\ndeconsolidation of our Ukrainian operations, and could trigger certain financial covenants or non-financial provisions in\nour debt agreements, requiring accelerated repayment, potentially triggering a cross-default across other debt\nagreements and the revolving credit facility and negatively impact our liquidity.\nManagement has taken actions to address the events and conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern. Except for the updates detailed below, the actions taken by management to address these events\nand conditions are those disclosed in the audited consolidated financial statements of VEON Ltd. as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 which were included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements:\n• We have implemented business continuity plans to address known contingency scenarios to ensure that we have\nadequate processes and practices in place to protect the safety of our people and to handle potential impacts to our\noperations in Ukraine.\n• Management actively monitors the Company’s liquidity position, our non-financial provisions in our debt agreements,\nand our equity levels on a regular and continuous basis both at the group and operating company levels and should\nthey reach a level considered at-risk, management will take actions to ensure our liquidity position is sufficient and our\nnon-financial provisions in our debt agreements are met.\n• On March 28, 2024, VEON announced that it repaid in full the outstanding balance of US$805 (principal, excluding\naccrued interest) and cancelled its RCF, after paying the matured portion of US$250 in February 2024.\n• Management is actively monitoring any new developments in applicable international and domestic sanctions to ensure\nthat we continue to be in compliance therewith as well as to evaluate any potential impact on the Company's financial\nperformance, operations, and governance. Management has also actively engaged with sanctions authorities where\nappropriate. Management continues to engage with relevant local authorities in Ukraine to address any concerns they\nhave about the ownership and management of Kyivstar and to provide all necessary assurances to confirm that\nRussian nationals, including any beneficial owners of LetterOne, do not participate in the management of Kyivstar nor\nare they able to derive any benefits from VEON’s assets in Ukraine.\n• On October 30, 2023, VEON announced that two appeals were filed with the relevant Kyiv courts, challenging the\nfreezing of the corporate rights in Kyivstar and Ukraine Tower Company, noting that corporate rights in Kyivstar and\nUkraine Tower Company belong exclusively to VEON, and that their full or partial freezing or seizure directly violates the\nrights of VEON and its international debt and equity investors, and requesting the lifting of the freezing of its corporate\nrights in Kyivstar and Ukraine Tower Company. In December 2023, the court rejected the Company’s appeals. On June\n4, 2024, the CEO of VEON, in his capacity as a shareholder of VEON, filed a motion with Shevchenkivskiy District Court\nof Kyiv requesting cancellation of the freeze of corporate rights in the VEON group's subsidiary Ukraine Tower\nCompany. On June 26, 2024, the motion was supplemented to request cancellation of the freezing of corporate rights in\nthe VEON group's other Ukrainian subsidiaries: Kyivstar, Kyivstar.Tech and Helsi Ukraine. VEON continued its\nsignificant government affairs efforts to protect our assets in Ukraine. On November 29, 2024, the Shevchenkivskyi\nDistrict Court of Kyiv ruled in favor of the request to unfreeze 47.85% of VEON’s corporate rights in Kyivstar and 100%\nof VEON’s corporate rights in its other Ukrainian subsidiaries. After the successful lifting of the court freeze of Kyivstar's\nshares, VEON is working with its local custodian to remove all remaining restrictions on Kyivstar and its Ukrainian\nVEON Holdings B.V. | Special purpose unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period\nended September 30, 2024 33\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)\nsubsidiaries corporate rights. VEON is pursing steps to meet the conditions required by the local custodian to lift the\nstipulated freeze.\n• As disclosed in Note 1, the VEON Holdings consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 were filed on\nNovember 21, 2024 and made available to bondholders pursuant to the non-financial covenants.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In accordance\nwith IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, the Company has determined that the aforementioned conditions and events,\nincluding those set out in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 filed on November 21,\n2024, considered in the aggregate, may cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for at\nleast twelve months after the date these consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance. Management expects\nthe actions it has taken or will take will mitigate the risk associated with the identified events and conditions. However, given the\nuncertainty and exogenous nature of the ongoing conflict and potential future imposed sanctions as well as potential new\ncounter-sanctions, and given the possible future imposition of external administration over our Russian and Ukrainian operations\nin particular, management concluded that a material uncertainty remains related to events or conditions that may cast significant\ndoubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, such that it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its\nliabilities in the normal course of business.\nNEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent\nwith those followed in the preparation of the Group’s audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nA number of new and amended standards became effective as of January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact on\nVEON financial statements. The Group has not early adopted any other standards, interpretations or amendments that have\nbeen issued but have not yet become effective.\nAmsterdam, December 13, 2024\nVEON Holdings B.V.\nVEON Holdings B.V. | Special purpose unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period\nended September 30, 2024 34"

(the “Company” or \"VEON Holdings\"), was incorporated as a private company (‘besloten\nvennootschap’) with limited liability under the laws of the Netherlands by notarial deed executed on 29 June 2009. The Company\nchanged its name from VimpelCom Holdings B.V. to VEON Holdings B.V., effective as of September 29, 2017.\nThe Company has its statutory seat and its principal place of business in Amsterdam. The Company is registered at the\nTrade Register of the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam under number 34345993.\nThe Directors’ Report as presented is prepared by the management of the Company and in line with the business and\nstrategic decisions of VEON Ltd. together with VEON Holdings B.V. (“VEON” or the “Group” and also referred to as “We”, “Our”\nand “Us”), the ultimate parent company. The strategic and business decisions made by management of VEON Ltd. are pertinent\nto VEON Holdings B.V. and its subsidiaries. In this directors’ report we will therefore often refer to the governance structure being\nin place at the level of VEON Ltd. as the Company will be impacted directly and indirectly by this governance structure and the\nrelated processes and procedures.\nVEON is a leading global provider of connectivity and internet services. Present in some of the world’s most dynamic\nmarkets, VEON currently provides nearly 160 million customers with voice, fixed broadband, data and digital services. VEON\ncurrently offers services to customers in the following countries: Pakistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, and\nKyrgyzstan. VEON’s reportable segments currently consist of the following five segments: Pakistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan,\nBangladesh and Uzbekistan. Kyrgyzstan is not a reportable segment; we therefore present our result of operations in Kyrgyzstan\nseparately under “Other” within our segment information disclosures. We provide key services, among others, under the\n“Kyivstar,” “Banglalink,” and “Jazz” brands. As of December 31, 2023, we had 17,131 employees For a breakdown of total\nrevenue by category of activity and geographic segments for each of the last three financial years, see —Operating and\nFinancial Review and Prospects.\nIn late 2019, we announced a new strategic framework at the Group level to boost long-term growth beyond traditional\nconnectivity services. This is laid out over three vectors: “Infrastructure” – its fundamental mobile and fixed\nline connectivity services and the drive of 4G adoption; “Digital Operator” – a portfolio of new services built around digital\ntechnologies with the active involvement of big data and artificial intelligence; and “Ventures” (now “Digital Assets”) – which\nseeks to identify, acquire and develop digital capabilities and assets into entities with potential for investment while also\nidentifying external assets fit for acquisition and investment. Since 2021, as part of our “Digital Operator” vector, our operating\ncompanies have been executing our “digital operator 1440” model pursuant to which we aim to enrich our connectivity offering\nwith proprietary digital applications and services. With this model, we aspire to grow not only the market share of our operators,\nbut also the relevance and the wallet share of our businesses and industry by delivering value via, for example, mobile\nentertainment, mobile health, mobile education, and mobile financial services.\nAs part of our initiative to digitize our core telecommunications business, ensuring we address 4G penetration levels across the\nGroup is vital as 4G services remain a core enabler of our digital strategy. We intend to continue focusing on increasing our\ncapital investment efficiency, including with respect to our IT, network, and distribution costs. We have secured network sharing\nagreements and intend to maintain our focus on achieving an asset-light business model in certain markets, where we own only\nthe core assets needed to operate our business. Across our markets, we are looking into opportunities to create stand-alone\nentities for our infrastructure assets and encourage industry-wide efficient usage of these companies. In certain markets, we\nhave progressed with tower deals which include the sale of our assets in exchange for long-term service agreements, liberating\ntime and resources for our operators to focus on customer-facing and digital initiatives. For further information on our capital\nexpenditures, see —Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Future Liquidity and\nCapital Requirements. We anticipate that we will finance the investments with operational cash flow, cash on our balance sheet\nand external financing. For more information on our recent developments, including the ongoing impact that the ongoing war\nbetween Russia and Ukraine has and may continue to have on our capital expenditure, see—Operating and Financial Review\nand Prospects—Key Developments for the year ended December 31, 2023 and —Operating and Financial Review and\nProspects—Key Developments after the year ended December 31, 2023.\nHistory\nOur predecessor PJSC VimpelCom (formerly OJSC “VimpelCom”) was founded in 1992. In 1996, VimpelCom listed on\nthe New York Stock Exchange. Its successor, VimpelCom Ltd., a Bermuda company, remained listed on the New York Stock\nExchange until 2013 when its listing moved to the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In March 2017, the company rebranded as\nVEON and on April 4, 2017, VEON began trading its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam. In October 2022, our listing was\ntransferred to the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nIn the early 2000s, we began an expansion into certain markets in Eastern Europe and Central Asia by acquiring local\noperators or entering into joint ventures with local partners, including, but not limited to, in Kazakhstan (2004), Ukraine (2005),\n4\nand Uzbekistan (2006). In 2010, we established our headquarters in Amsterdam. In 2011, we completed the acquisition of Global\nTelecom Holding (GTH, previously known as Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E.) and through a series of transactions beginning in\nJuly 2019 through September 2019, VEON Holdings B.V. acquired substantially all of GTH’s operating assets in Pakistan and\nBangladesh. In March 2021, the group successfully completed its acquisition of the 15% minority stake in Pakistan Mobile\nCommunication Limited (“PMCL”), its Pakistan operating business, from the Dhabi Group for US$273 million. In July 2021,\nVEON exercised its put option to sell the entirety of its 45.57% stake in its Algerian subsidiary, Omnium Telecom Algérie SpA,\nwhich owns Algerian mobile network operator, Djezzy, to the Algerian National Investment Fund, Fonds National\nd’Investissement (FNI), which sale was completed on August 5, 2022 for a sale price of US$682 million. On November 24, 2022,\nfollowing a competitive process, we entered into an agreement to sell our Russian Operations to certain senior members of the\nmanagement team of VimpelCom, led by the CEO at the time, Aleksander Torbakhov. Under the agreement, as amended and\nrestated on September 13 2023, (the “Sale and Purchase Agreement”) we received consideration equal to RUB 130 billion\n(approximately US$1,294 million equivalent). The Sale and Purchase Agreement allowed for the entire consideration of the sale\nto be satisfied by transferring the VEON Holdings bonds acquired by VimpelCom to a wholly owned subsidiary of VEON\nHoldings, to hold such notes until their cancellation or maturity. The sale was completed on October 9, 2023. An additional\nUS$72 million equivalent of VEON Holdings bonds were transferred to VEON Holdings’ wholly owned subsidiary upon the receipt\nof an OFAC license in June 2024, to offset the remaining deferred purchase price for our Russian Operations in July 2024.\n5\nKey Developments\nKey Developments for the year ended December 31, 2023\nCompletion of Sale of Russian operations\nOn October 9, 2023, VEON announced the completion of its exit from Russia with closing of the sale of its Russian\noperations. On September 13, 2023, VEON and the buyer agreed on certain amendments to the Share Purchase Agreement\n(“SPA”) which had no material impact on the economic terms of the original transaction announced on November 24, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, VimpelCom independently purchased US$2,140 million equivalent of\nVEON Holdings bonds (based on applicable foreign exchange rates on the relevant purchase dates) in order to satisfy certain\nRussian regulatory obligations. VEON Holdings B.V. redeemed US$406 million of these notes from VimpelCom following their\nmaturity in September 2023.\nUpon the completion of the sale of our Russian Operations, VEON Holdings B.V. bonds representing a nominal value of\nUS$1,576 million which were acquired by VimpelCom were transferred to Unitel LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany) and offset against the purchase consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294 million on October 9,\n2023) on a non cash basis resulting in no impact on our cash flows.\nThe remaining deferred consideration of US$72 million as of December 31, 2023 was offset against VEON Holdings\nB.V. bonds acquired by VimpelCom representing a nominal value of US$72 million, in July 2024, in compliance with applicable\nregulatory licensing after receiving the relevant regulatory approvals. In addition, there was a US$11 million receivable against\nthe sale of towers in Russia recognized in prior periods that was also assigned to the Company as part of the sale transaction.\nRefer to Note 22 for further details.\nThe financial impact of the sale of our Russian operations is a loss of US$3,746 million recorded within (Loss) / Profit\nafter Tax from Discontinued Operations” in the Consolidated Income Statement, primarily due to US$3,414 million of cumulative\ncurrency translation losses which accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income and recycled through the\nconsolidated income statement on the date of the disposal. Overall, the sale of the Russian Operations resulted in significant\ndeleveraging of VEON’s balance sheet. For further details, refer to Note 10.\nBased on the applicable USD / RUB exchange rates at the applicable purchase dates (which took place between\nFebruary 2023 and September 2023).\nAgreement between Banglalink and Summit regarding the sale of its Bangladesh tower assets\nOn November 15, 2023, VEON announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Banglalink, has entered into an Asset Sale\nand Purchase Agreement (“APA”) and Master Tower Agreement (“MTA”), to sell a portion of its tower portfolio (2,012 towers,\nnearly one-third of Banglalink's infrastructure portfolio) in Bangladesh to the buyer, Summit, for BDT 11 billion (US$97 million).\nThe closing of the transaction was subject to regulatory approval which was received on December 21, 2023. Subsequently, the\ndeal closed on December 31, 2023. Under the terms of the deal, Banglalink entered into a long-term lease agreement with\nSummit under which Banglalink will lease space upon the sold towers for a period of 12 years, with up to seven optional renewal\nperiods of 10 years each. The lease agreement became effective upon the closing of the sale.\nAs of November 15, 2023, the Bangladesh towers were classified as assets held for sale. Following the classification as\ndisposal group held-for-sale, the Company did not account for depreciation and amortization expenses of the Bangladesh tower\nassets. As a result of the closing of the sale on December 31, 2023, control of the towers was transferred to Summit and\nBanglalink recognized the purchase consideration of BDT 11 billion (US$97 million) net of cost of disposals containing legal,\nregulatory and investment bankers costs amounting to BDT 855 million (US$8 million). The consideration was receivable as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and payment was subsequently received in January 2024 upon the final completion date under the terms of\nthe APA. As a result of applying sale and leaseback accounting principles to the lease agreement under the terms of the deal,\nBanglalink recognized a gain on sale of assets of BDT 4 billion (US$34 million), right-of-use assets of BDT 550 million (US$5\nmillion) representing the proportional fair value of assets (towers) retained with respect to the book value of assets (towers) sold\namounting to BDT 950 million (US$9 million) and lease liabilities of BDT 6 billion (US$52 million) based on a 12 year lease term,\nwhich are at market rates. Additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of BDT 4 billion (US$40 million) were recognized for\ntotal right-of-use assets of BDT 5 billion (US$45 million) and total lease liabilities of BDT 10 billion (US$92 million).\nCybersecurity Incident in Ukraine\nOn December 12, 2023, VEON announced that the network of its Ukrainian subsidiary Kyivstar had been the target of a\nwidespread external cyber-attack causing a technical failure. This resulted in a temporary disruption of Kyivstar's network and\nservices, interrupting the provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and fixed networks, international roaming, and SMS\nservices, amongst others, for Kyivstar customers in Ukraine and abroad. The Company’s technical teams, working relentlessly\nand in collaboration with the Ukrainian law enforcement and government agencies and the Security Service of Ukraine, restored\nservices in multiple stages starting with voice and data connectivity. On December 19, 2023, VEON announced that Kyivstar had\nrestored services in all categories of its communication services, and that mobile voice and internet, fixed connectivity and SMS\nservices as well as the MyKyivstar self-care application were active and available across Ukraine.\nAfter stabilizing the network, although there was no legal obligation to do so, Kyivstar immediately launched offers to\nthank its customers for their loyalty, initiating a “Free of Charge” program offering one month of free services on certain types of\n6\ncontracts. Furthermore, on December 21, 2023, Kyivstar announced a donation of UAH 100 million (US$3 million) would be\nmade towards Ukrainian charity initiatives.\nLargely due to the limited period during which the critical services were down, there was no material financial impact on\nour consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to these service disruptions, or due to costs associated with\nadditional IT capabilities required for restoring services, replacing lost equipment or compensating external consultants and\npartners in 2023. The incident had a significant impact on consolidated revenue results for the six-months ended June 30, 2024\nassociated with the revenue loss arising from the customer loyalty measures taken by Kyivstar in order to compensate for the\ninconvenience caused during the disruptions. The impact of these offers on operating revenue in 2024 was US$46 million. VEON\nexpects no further impact on its financial results arising from the customer loyalty measures under the retention programs, which\nended during the first half of 2024.\nVEON and Kyivstar conducted a thorough investigation, together with outside cybersecurity firms, to determine the full\nnature, extent and impact of the incident and to implement additional security measures to protect against any recurrence. The\nUkrainian government also conducted an investigation to support the recovery efforts. All investigations were concluded as of\nJune 30, 2024, and has resulted in an in depth analysis into details of how the attack was executed and how this can be\nprevented in the future.\nKyivstar has initiated remediation and mitigation actions to reduce current risks and establish a robust framework to\nmanage evolving cyber threats, protect business continuity and maintain customer trust by investing in immediate response\nactions, enhanced security infrastructure, proactive threat management, compliance with cybersecurity regulations and\nstandards, employee awareness, and long-term adaptive measures. Further, VEON Group has executed a group-wide\nassessment of cybersecurity maturity in alignment with the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity\nFramework 2.0 (NIST2).\nVEON’s Scheme of arrangement (the “Scheme”)\nFollowing the announcement made by VEON on November 24, 2022 to launch a scheme of arrangement to extend the\nmaturity of the 2023 Notes (the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and 7.25% notes due April 2023), the initial proposed scheme\nwas amended on January 11, 2023 and on January 24, 2023, the Scheme Meeting was held and the amended Scheme was\napproved by 97.59% of the Scheme creditors present and voting.\nOn January 30, 2023, VEON announced that the Scheme Sanction Hearing had taken place, at which the Court made\nan order sanctioning the Scheme in respect of VEON Holdings B.V.’ 2023 Notes (the “Order”). On January 31, 2023, VEON\nconfirmed that the Order had been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The amendments to the 2023 Notes were subject to\nthe receipt of relevant licenses to become effective, at which time the maturity dates of the February 2023 and April 2023 notes\nwould be amended to October and December 2023, respectively.\nOn April 3, 2023, VEON announced that each of the conditions had been satisfied in accordance with the terms of the\nScheme, including receipt of all authorizations and/or licenses necessary to implement the amendments to the 2023 Notes (as\nset out in the Scheme). On April 4, 2023, the Scheme became effective.\nPursuant to the amendments, Noteholders were entitled to payment of an amendment fee of 200bps payable on the 2023\nNotes outstanding on their respective amended maturity dates and a put right was granted requiring VEON Holdings B.V. to\nrepurchase 2023 Notes held by 2023 Noteholders exercising such right, at a purchase price of 102% of the principal amount\n(“2023 Put Option”), together with accrued and unpaid interest. The 2023 Put Option closed on April 19, 2023 with holders of\nUS$165 million of the October 2023 Notes and holders of US$294 million of the December 2023 Notes exercising the Put\nOption. The aggregate put option premium paid was US$9 million. The 2023 Put Option was settled on April 26, 2023. The\nremaining October 2023 notes were repaid at maturity including an amendment fee of US$1 million.

The tenor of the facility is five years.\nKaR-Tel Limited Liability Partnership (\"KaR-Tel\") credit facility\nKaR-Tel utilized KZT 9.8 billion (US$22 million) from the bilateral credit facility with ForteBank JSC during the period of\nSeptember to December 2023. Through a deed of amendment signed in February 2024, the maturity of the facility was extended\nto November 2026 and facility amount enhanced to KZT 15 billion from KZT 10 billion.\nRepayment of VEON Holdings B.V. 5.95% Senior Notes\nOn October 13, 2023 VEON Holdings B.V. repaid its outstanding 5.95% Senior Notes amounting to US$39 million at their\nmaturity date.\nEarly redemption of VEON Holdings B.V. 2023 and 2024 Notes\nOn September 13, 2023, VEON Holdings B.V. issued two redemption notices for the early repayment of its bonds\nmaturing in December 2023 and June 2024, with a planned redemption date of September 27, 2023.

Please refer to Note 16-Investments, Debt and Derivatives for further details.\nU.S. Treasury expands general license to include both VEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings B.V.\nOn January 18, 2023, VEON announced that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control\n(OFAC) replaced the General License 54 originally issued on November 18, 2022 with General License 54A to now include both\nVEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings.\nThis general license authorizes all transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to the purchase and receipt of any\ndebt or equity securities of VEON Ltd. or VEON Holdings B.V. that would otherwise be prohibited by section 1(a)(i) of Executive\nOrder (E.O.) 14071. OFAC General License 54A applies to all debt and equity securities of VEON Ltd. or VEON Holdings B.V.\nthat were issued before June 6, 2022, and confirms that the authorization applies not only to the purchase and receipt of debt\nand equity securities, but also to transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to facilitating, clearing and settling of such\ntransactions. This General License ensures that all market participants can trade the relevant securities with confidence that\nsuch trading is consistent with E.O. 14071, which targeted “new investment” in Russia.\nFreezing of corporate rights in Kyivstar\nOn October 6, 2023, the Security Services of Ukraine (SSU) announced that the Ukrainian courts were seizing all\n“corporate rights” of Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and Andriy Kosogov in 20 Ukrainian companies that these individuals beneficially\nown, while criminal proceedings, unrelated to Kyivstar or VEON, were in progress. This announcement was incorrectly\ncharacterized by some Ukrainian media as a “seizure” or “freezing” of “Kyivstar’s assets” as the assets of Kyivstar had not been\nseized or frozen and the court’s ruling did not impact the assets of Kyivstar directly. On October 9, 2023, Ukrainian media further\nreported, with a headline which incorrectly targeted Kyivstar, that the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine was separately finalizing a\nlawsuit in the Ukraine High Anti-Corruption Court to confiscate any Ukrainian assets of M. Fridman. Subsequent clarification by\nthe SSU noted that “The seizure of corporate rights of Ukrainian companies does not affect the protection of the interests of\nforeign investors and owners of shares of corporate rights, does not hinder their economic activity and the possibility of receiving\ndividends.” We have received notification from our local custodian that 47.85% of Kyivstar shares have been blocked, which will\nprevent any transaction involving our Kyivstar shares, including transfer of such shares, from proceeding. On October 30, 2023\nVEON announced that VEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings B.V. had filed two appeals with the relevant Kyiv court of appeals,\nchallenging the freezing of the corporate rights in Kyivstar, noting that corporate rights in Kyivstar belong exclusively to VEON\nand that their full or partial seizure directly violates the rights of VEON and its international debt and equity investors, and\nrequesting the lifting of the freezing of its corporate rights in Kyivstar. In December 2023, the court rejected our appeals. On June\n4, 2024, the CEO of VEON, in his capacity as a shareholder of VEON, filed a motion with Shevchenkiv District Court of Kyiv\nrequesting cancellation of the seizure of corporate rights in the VEON group's subsidiary Ukraine Tower Company. On June 26,\n2024, the motion was supplemented to request cancellation of the seizure of corporate rights in the VEON group's other\nUkrainian subsidiaries: Kyivstar, Kyivstar.Tech and Helsi. VEON is continuing significant government affairs efforts to protect our\nassets in Ukraine. Restrictions applicable in Ukraine to all foreign-owned companies have already led to restrictions on the\nupstreaming of dividends from Ukraine to VEON. Additionally, to the extent that VEON and/or Kyivstar are deemed to be\ncontrolled by persons sanctioned in Ukraine, potential prohibitions on renting property and land, on participating in public\nprocurement and on the transfer of technology and intellectual property rights to Kyivstar from VEON impacting B2G revenue\nwould also apply.\nBased on the above development, VEON assessed whether the court order and subsequent motions result in an event\nthat VEON has lost control over its Ukrainian subsidiary (“Kyivstar”) and concluded that, under the requirements of relevant\nreporting standards (IFRS 10, Consolidated financial Statements), VEON continues to control Kyivstar and as such, will continue\nto consolidate Kyivstar in these financial statements.\n8\nVEON Ltd. implements new Clawback Policy\nOn November 27, 2023, VEON Ltd. announced governance enhancements to its executive remuneration structure, in\nline with its commitment to ethical corporate governance practices and financial integrity. The Board of Directors of VEON Ltd.\nintroduced a robust Policy for the Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation (the “Clawback Policy”) to align with Section\n10D and Rule 10D-1of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the listing standards adopted by NASDAQ.\nEffective October 2, 2023, the Clawback Policy enables VEON Ltd. to recover erroneously awarded incentive-based\ncompensation from current and former Executive Officers (as defined in the Clawback Policy) in the event that it is required to\nprepare an accounting restatement. This step is crucial in maintaining transparency and accountability, particularly in instances\nrequiring accounting restatements.\nIn tandem with the adoption of the Clawback Policy, the Board of Directors has also revised existing incentive-based\ncompensation plans to further align executive remuneration with shareholder interests and corporate objectives. Refer to Note 21\nRelated Parties for further details.\nVEON Ltd.'s Management increases ownership\nOn February 21, 2023, VEON Ltd. announced the completion of the transfer of 52,550 shares in VEON Ltd. to Joop\nBrakenhoff.

These events and\nthe political unrest have negatively impacted the populations’ disposable income and influenced telecom spending patterns, while\nincreased operation costs for the business unit identified indicators of an impairment event with respect to our Bangladesh CGU\nin the third quarter of 2024. Management has not yet finalized the quantitative and qualitative assessments and valuation tests\nrequired to determine the estimated financial impact of such triggers in Bangladesh during the third quarter of 2024. Preliminary\nanalysis suggests that we may incur a substantial impairment charge to the carrying value of the Bangladesh CGU for the period\nended September 30, 2024. As of the date of November 20, 2024, we do not have enough certainty to provide an estimate of the\ncharge or range of potential outcomes, but initial results of quantitative and qualitative assessments and valuation tests indicate\nthat an impairment charge is likely to be material. We, however, cannot rule out the possibility that the final results of our\nimpairment analysis may deviate significantly from our preliminary assessment. Final results of the analysis will be published in\nour interim unaudited consolidated condensed financial statement for the period ended September 30, 2024. Following the\nannual impairment goodwill test as at September 30, 2023 and the subsequent triggering event analysis as at December 31,\n2023, no impairments were found at our Bangladesh CGU as, amongst other factors, it was operating in a revenue growth period\n(which period lasted through our second quarter of 2024), however, the Bangladesh CGU did have limited headroom in its\ncarrying value; as a result, the impairment charge is expected to have a direct impact on our operating profit. See Note 11—\nImpairment of Assets to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. The circumstances in Bangladesh\ncould also impact our assessment relating to the recognition and recoverability of our deferred tax assets in Bangladesh.\nChanges in Directors of VEON Holdings B.V.\nOn March 7, 2024, Bruce John Leishman and Maciej Bogdan Wojtaszek were appointed statutory directors of the\nCompany, while on the same date Jochem Benjamin Postma and Paul Klaassen stepped down as statutory directors of the\nCompany.\nIssuance of PKR Sukuk bond by Pakistan Mobile Communication Limited (\"PMCL\")\nIn October 2024, Pakistan Mobile Communication Limited (\"PMCL\") issued short term PKR sukuk bond of PKR 15\nbillion (US$54) with a maturity of six months.

Unless\nnoted otherwise, we plan to apply for renewal of these licenses prior to their expiration.\nServices License Expiration\nFixed-line, long distance and international Nationwide Unlimited\nData Nationwide Unlimited\n40\nRegulatory\nFor a description of certain laws and government regulations to which our main telecommunications businesses are\nsubject, see —Regulation of Telecommunications.\nThe voice, data, value-added, connectivity, and other services that we provide may expose us to sanctions and\nembargo laws and regulations of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the\njurisdictions in which we operate. We currently face civil instability within our geographic footprint, and in this context, changes in\nlocal regulation and laws can be unpredictable, arbitrary and/or politically motivated, and such changes may result in material\nadverse consequences for the Group. Under the circumstances of the ongoing war in Ukraine, military conflicts, and civil unrest\nin other countries in which we have a footprint, governments have in the past and could in future pass and enforce sanctions and\nother measures that materially and adversely impact our operations or our ownership in our businesses, without regard to pre-\nexisting laws and foreign investment assurances. In addition, as a global telecommunications company, we have roaming and\ninterconnect arrangements with mobile and fixed-line operators located in the majority of countries throughout the world,\nincluding in countries that are the target of certain sanctions restrictions. For a discussion of the sanctions regimes we are\nsubject to, including the risks related to such exposure, see —Risk Factors—Regulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks—\nViolations of and changes to applicable sanctions and embargo laws, including export control restrictions, may harm our\nbusiness.\nSeasonality\nTelecommunications services are often impacted by seasonality, with certain months seen as higher consumption\nperiods and others as low. Given the geographical diversity of our markets and the re-distribution of our Group revenues in a way\nthat each operating company has a noticeable impact, it is not possible to talk about high and low seasons for the Group as a\nwhole. Seasonality trends might be further disrupted, somewhat materially, but not fully predictably, by the changing time of\nRamadan and the Islamic religious festivals in Pakistan and Bangladesh, the timing or timings of our operating companies’\nrepricing actions and the large-scale network rollouts. In 2023, our business continued to be impacted, to some extent, by each\nof these trends. We continued to experience impacts on business as a result of the onset of the war in Ukraine (including the\ninfrastructure damage and the population displacement it generated as well as the depreciation of local currencies). We were\nalso impacted by the cyber-attack on Kyivstar in December 2023, the subsequent network shutdown and the customer retention\nprograms which followed. We were further impacted by extreme climate events, such as the cyclone in Bangladesh and floods in\nPakistan as well as the pre-election climate and consumer sentiment in those markets. These irregularities, as well as some\nresidual impacts of COVID in 2021 and 2020, make it impossible to isolate the specific impact of seasonality, if any, on our\nbusiness through 2023.\nCorporate Governance\nAs a Bermuda incorporated exempt company with ADSs listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, VEON follows a set of\ngovernance principles other than the Dutch ones, and as the Dutch Corporate Governance Code only applies to companies\nincorporated in the Netherlands, we have chosen not to comply with the best practice provisions of the Dutch Corporate\nGovernance Code as at the date of this report. However, annually, we do consider and make an assessment of our directors’\nindependence, as if the Dutch Corporate Governance Code applied to us, and we also consider the principles of the Dutch\nCorporate Governance Code from time to time in other matters. There is also no other external corporate governance code that\nthe company follows.\nThe Company has implemented a Code of Conduct that sets forth the framework and principles in key areas, including\nour zero tolerance for bribery, to ensure we adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct. The Company also has a\nBusiness Code of Conduct which established basic requirements and responsibilities for our business partners. Please refer to\nCode of Ethics for further information on the Company.\nThe Company’s zero tolerance for bribery is underpinned by VEON’s Anti-bribery and Corruption policy which outlines\nthe Company’s risks related to bribery and corruption, highlights VEON Group personnel’s responsibilities under the relevant\nanti-corruption laws and Company policies, and provides the tools and support necessary to identify and combat those Bribery\nand Corruption risks. Other related policies include the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Policy (AML/CTF\nPolicy), Sanctions and Export Controls Policy, Conflict of Interest Policy, Third Party Risk Management Policy, Group Contracting\nFramework and Speak Up: Raising Concerns and Non-Retaliation Policy.\nRegarding third party due diligence and standards for the selection, screening, engagement, retention, and monitoring of all third\nparties. Key requirements include:\na. all third parties must be screened for sanctions and restricted party risk in accordance with the requirements of the\nSanctions Policy and the AML/CTF Policy;\nb. selection, engagement, and retention of business partners, are subject to a risk-based evaluation, including risk\nassessment and due diligence -the risk assessment must also include a check against our “red flag vendors list”; and\n41\nc. implementation of a risk-based approach for conducting ongoing monitoring of business partners throughout the course\nof the relationship to ensure, amongst other criteria, the business partners are in compliance with the Business Partner\nCode of Conduct.\nThe Guidelines for OpCo CSR Strategies and Social Contributions codify that the Company does not make donations of\nany type, either in cash or in kind, to political parties, organizations, factions or movements of public or private nature, whose\nactivity is clearly linked with political or religious activities. In adherence with the principles of transparency the Company also\npublishes its corporate citizenship strategy, performance and programs in its annual sustainability report.\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity\nWe have restructured VEON’s cybersecurity policy landscape to properly reflect our ambitions to become an information\nsecurity certified company through reworking all of our cybersecurity standards to provide tactical cybersecurity guidance in\naccordance with ISO 27001 and certain process handbooks (especially risk management and incident management handbooks)\nat the operational level. In order to enhance collaboration across the VEON Group, we commenced a new roadmap initiative to\nenhance alignment and transparency between HQ and our operating company cybersecurity teams. We have conducted several\ncollaboration sessions with various operating company teams to identify potential improvement areas and to align on a future\nroadmap plan with special focus placed on potential cybersecurity threats. In December 2023, we engaged an independent\nexternal service provider to assess the maturity and compliance level of our HQ information security management system\nagainst industry standard ISO 27001 and achieved ISO 27001 certification in September 2024.\nAs part of our overall strategy and ambition, in 2023, a special focus was given to the development, improvement and\nmaintenance of our information technology and cybersecurity systems as well as to the development and execution of our\ncybersecurity policy. In 2023, we completed a project to enhance the anti-phishing mechanisms and safeguards for our email\nsystems to provide an additional layer of security against phishing attacks that target our personnel through malicious emails. In\n2023, we also replaced our content management system (“CMS”) service provider in order to improve the performance and\nsecurity of the VEON corporate website and the content published there. The vendor selection process for the CMS migration\nwas carried out diligently to avoid service and access disruptions on the VEON website. In order to effectively manage the third-\nparty provider associated risks, a vendor management handbook was introduced to establish a well-defined third-party\nmanagement process. The goal of this vendor management handbook is to provide a detailed and systematic approach for\neffectively handling cyber security aspects of supplier relationships and service delivery within the VEON group environment. The\nvendor management process established at VEON is mainly composed of three phases including vendor onboarding, regular\nperformance monitoring and exit or change actions depending on the measured performances of third-party providers.\nWe also initiated and in some cases completed upgrades to our digital business support systems (DBSS) across all of\nour operating companies in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and DBSS has been deployed in our\nUzbekistan Operating Company with completion expected in early 2025. The enhancement of our IT and cybersecurity\ncapabilities optimizes controls, performance and the experience of our stakeholders as they use our core services. At the same\ntime our advanced capabilities enables our operators to offer IT, cybersecurity and big data/artificial intelligence-based products\nas a part of their B2B portfolios. Our portfolio of advanced IT/big data services includes data-driven marketing (“AdTech”), risk\nscoring models, geo-analytics, video/audio analytics, cybersecurity as a service, private industrial networks, integration and cloud\ninfrastructure services. Jazz, our operating company in Pakistan, extended the deployment of Kron’s PAM solution in the\ngovernment and banking sector to utilize the cybersecurity-as-a-service model for revenue generation. Jazz also completed and\nunveiled Pakistan’s largest Tier III certified data center on January 25, 2022, which serves the business needs of our Pakistan\noperations, as well as those of the broader business community in Pakistan. A major technical upgrade was executed in\nBangladesh to ensure efficient operations of our TV/media service enjoying 24 million monthly active users during the Football\nWorld Cup in 2022. Our operations in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan offer cybersecurity as a service proposition on a commercial\nbasis to major clients in the banking sector.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nOur cybersecurity risk management strategy consists of:\na. investment in IT security and cybersecurity infrastructure;\nb. detailed cybersecurity policies, procedures and robust educational trainings for our personnel;\nc. an overall strategy to develop, improve and monitor our cybersecurity systems, processes, policies and governance\nframeworks that have been embedded into our overall risk management framework;\nd. integrated third-party cybersecurity technologies and tools; and\ne. governance through Board and management oversight.\nIn 2023, we have restructured VEON’s cybersecurity policy landscape to properly reflect our ambitions to become an\ninformation security certified company through reworking all of our cybersecurity standards to provide tactical cybersecurity\nguidance in accordance with ISO 27001 and certain process handbooks (specially risk management and incident management\n42\nhandbooks) at the operational level. In order to enhance collaboration across the VEON Group, we commenced a new roadmap\ninitiative to enhance alignment and transparency between HQ and our operating company cybersecurity teams. We have\nconducted several collaboration sessions with various operating company teams to identify potential improvement areas and to\nalign on a future roadmap plan with special focus placed on potential cybersecurity threats. In December 2023, we engaged an\nindependent external service provider to assess the maturity and compliance level of our HQ information security management\nsystem against industry standard ISO27001 and achieved ISO 27001 certification in September 2024. Our operating companies\nin Bangladesh, Ukraine and Pakistan completed ISO 27001 (Information Security Management System) certification during\n2022. Our Bangladesh and Ukraine operating companies re-certified under ISO 27001 in 2023 and Jazz extended the scope of\nits ISO 27001 certification to cover telco core network, in addition to upgrading certain legacy cybersecurity solutions to enhance\nsecurity incident detection and response coverage and implementing a multiple tier 1 systems at its disaster recovery site to\nensure service availability where the primary site is affected by a cyber-attack or other disaster. Our operating companies in\nKyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan similarly obtained ISO 27001 certification in early 2023. Further, in 2023, our microfinancing\nsubsidiary in Mobilink Bank launched initiatives aiming to achieve ISO 27001 in 2024 with solid commitment and support\nprovided from the management team and our Uzbekistan operating company has similarly launched initiatives to become ISO\n27001 complaint. Our Bangladesh operating company also has also implemented multiple tier 1 systems at its disaster recovery\nsite to ensure service availability where the primary site is affected by a cyber-attack or other disaster.\nPenetration tests and so-called “ethical hacking” tests are being carried out frequently across our operating companies\nto assess the current cybersecurity levels and proactively detect possible weaknesses in different systems. This allows us to act\non potential cybersecurity problems before they materialize. To increase cybersecurity awareness even further a new email\n“phishing campaign” has been launched. As a next step, employees’ cybersecurity awareness will be regularly monitored through\nnew campaigns and an online awareness test.\nFinally, as part of the sale of our Russian Operations, starting in 2023, all our IT and cybersecurity applications which\nwere operated from Russia have been relocated either to Kazakhstan (including, geo-redundant storage) or Amsterdam.\nGovernance\nCybersecurity and compliance with data protection regulations remain key priorities. The Audit and Risk Committee\nreceives reports on our IT and cybersecurity activities on a semi-annual basis and any significant cybersecurity developments or\nincidents are reported to the Board of Directors if and when they arise. Chief information security officers of operating companies\nhave distinguished professional certifications within cyber security relevant domains such as certified information systems\nsecurity professional, certified information security manager, global information assurance certification, accompanied by\nexperience gained especially in the telecom industry over the course of several years. Within their organizations they are usually\npositioned with a direct reporting function to chief information or technology officers so as to retain required empowerment to\nserve in a best way to defend cyber security interests of the operating companies. The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible\nfor regularly assessing cybersecurity risk and provides oversight of our IT and cybersecurity policies, procedures and strategies\nand receives regular reports from management, including the chief cybersecurity officers, relating to our cybersecurity practices,\nto assist with fulfilling this mandate.\nOur updated cybersecurity policy came into effect on February 2023. We regularly run cybersecurity forums to allow for\nstructured and consistent governance throughout VEON, which is used to enforce the implementation of our cybersecurity policy,\nshare best practices, lessons learned, industry developments, and other industries’ experiences. We have also established and\ncontinue to improve our VEON group-wide horizontal experience exchange mechanism to share best practices in cybersecurity\nas well as to report and track operational alarms, ongoing attacks and more across operating companies to enable us to respond\nto cyber threats of global scale.\nCybersecurity Incidents\nIn December 2023, our Ukrainian subsidiary, Kyivstar was the target of a widespread hacker attack that caused\ntechnical failure and disruption to its services. As a result of the attack, provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and\nfixed networks, international roaming, and SMS services, amongst others were temporarily unavailable for Kyivstar customers in\nUkraine and abroad. In collaboration with the Ukrainian law enforcement, the Security Service of Ukraine and government\nagencies, Kyivstar was able to restore its services in multiple stages starting with voice and data connectivity and immediately\nlaunched offers to thank its customers for their loyalty once the network was stabilized from the attack.\nThere was no material financial impact on VEON’s consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to\nthe service disruptions and related direct costs of the attack. However, there was a material impact on VEON’s consolidated\nrevenue and EBITDA results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 associated with the revenue loss arising from the customer\nloyalty measures taken by Kyivstar in order to compensate for the inconvenience caused during the disruptions. In total, the\ncyber-attack and dedicated customer retention program has resulted in a loss of UAH 0.8 billion (US$23 million) on revenue and\na loss of UAH 0.9 billion (US$24 million) in EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2023. The incident had a significant\nimpact on consolidated revenue results for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 associated with the revenue loss arising from\nthe customer loyalty measures taken by Kyivstar in order to compensate for the inconvenience caused during the disruptions.\nThe impact of these offers on operating revenue for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 was US$46 million. We expect no\n43\nfurther impact on our financial results arising from the customer loyalty measures under the retention programs, which ended\nduring the first half of 2024.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks and domain name registrations, copyright protection and\ncontractual restrictions to establish and protect our technologies, brand name, logos, marketing designs and internet domain\nnames. We have registered and applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in connection with our\ntelecommunications and digital businesses in accordance with the laws of our operating companies. Our registered trademarks\nand service marks include our brand name, logos and certain advertising features. Our copyrights and know-how are principally\nin the area of computer software for service applications developed in connection with our mobile and fixed-line network platform,\nour internet platforms and non-connectivity service offerings and for the language and designs we use in marketing and\nadvertising our communication services. For a discussion of the risks associated with new technology, see Risk Factors—\nOperational Risks—The loss of important intellectual property rights as well as third-party claims that we have infringed on their\nintellectual property rights could significantly harm our business.\nSustainability\nThe Group CFO oversees the corporate sustainability (ESG) program and confers with our management in\nconnection with executing its duties. VEON’s approach with respect to corporate sustainability is defined and reviewed\nperiodically by the “ESG Steering Committee” chaired by the Group CFO with all relevant Group-level directors as members of\nthe ESG Steering Committee.\nOur approach to sustainability goes beyond corporate social responsibility and is centered around our mission to\nprovide customers with connectivity, access to information and other vital digital services. We believe that connectivity and\ncommunication are essential humanitarian needs, whether it be connecting with loved ones, seeking help or searching for\ninformation and news from reliable sources, which entails a strong emphasis on the “social” pillar of the ESG framework.\nThrough our strategy based on three pillars – “Digital Operator 1440”, “Digital Assets”, and “Infrastructure” – we transform lives,\ncreate opportunities for greater digital inclusion, empower people and drive economic growth. We engage with VEON\nstakeholders aiming to the sustainable value creation and long-term success of our business. Our digital entrepreneurship and\ndigital skills and literacy programs help us to contribute to long-term socioeconomic value for the communities we serve. Through\npromoting digital equity and inclusion and creating new opportunities for participants, these programs also contribute to the\ndemand for digital products and services, which in turn creates new opportunities for our business. In parallel with the “social”\nelements of our approach to ESG, we simultaneously ensure due attention is paid to the “governance” pillar. Indeed, we strive to\nact as good corporate citizens, promoting and reinforcing ethical business behavior with responsible corporate governance all\nwith the aim of delivering on operational performance. VEON is committed to creating social and business value by making\nimpactful investments that help create new services, partnerships and forums, which in turn enable and empower the people we\nserve across our markets.\nOur Integrated Annual Report 2023 is guided by the principles of stakeholder engagement and materiality of the Global\nReporting Initiative (GRI), utilizes ESG KPIs for the Mobile Industry recommended by GSMA as well as WEF’s Stakeholder\nCapitalism metrics and is aligned with the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development goals.\nAs part of our reporting cycle, we assess the effectiveness of our sustainability strategy and revise it when needed.\nOur approach to the identification, management and evaluation of sustainability is guided by three main principles:\n• Stakeholders: By engaging with our stakeholders, we understand their concerns and expectations, and consider their\nopinions in our decision-making;\n• Materiality: We conducted our most recent materiality assessment in 2022, which defined our priority topics to focus on\nas a Company, following engagement with internal and external stakeholders. Over the past year, the Board and\nmanagement reviewed this materiality analysis, and believe these issues are still the most relevant to VEON and its\nstakeholders. VEON has therefore remained focused on progressing with the economic, social, environmental and\ngovernance issues that are most material to our business and stakeholders. VEON’s material topics shape our\napproach to earning and preserving value for our stakeholders, while our license to operate focuses on efforts aimed at\nimproving and sustaining our operations. Altogether, these are VEON’s material matters, emphasizing the most critical\nareas that provide long-term sustainable benefits to all our stakeholders; and\n• Accountability: We are accountable to our stakeholders through the publication of our Integrated Annual Report. We\nalso share periodic updates with internal stakeholders, including members of management, to inform them about key\nsustainability-related developments and our sustainability performance.\nOur approach to sustainability disclosures meets Global Reporting Initiative standards at the “core” level, follows the guidance in\nthe AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard and is influenced by International Integrated Reporting Council guidance. For the\nAA1000 Principles, our assured engagement was planned and performed to meet the requirements of a Type 1 “moderate level”\nof assurance as defined by AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS) 2008.\n44\nIn February 2024, MSCI upgraded VEON’s ESG rating from “A” to “AA” for its Environmental, Social, and Governance\nperformance1. We are also proud to be a member of the GSM Association’s (GSMA) climate action taskforce and are planning to\nalign with the organization’s goal of achieving net-zero GHG emissions for our industry by 2050. By taking this step, we are\nworking towards setting climate action targets for our business that help our industry meet its emissions objectives. Furthermore,\nall our operating companies participated, for the first time in 2023, in the GSMA’s “Energy Benchmark Initiative.”\nOur support for our industry’s ambitions corresponds with a variety of existing initiatives to reduce the energy intensity\nof our business. VEON continues to work to further reduce the Group’s emissions wherever possible, committing and acting by\nmoving more toward focusing on how to further reduce energy consumption. We are committed to mitigating our carbon footprint\nand the rollout of network energy-efficiency measures, which will contribute to a low-carbon economy as well as offer us the\npotential to reduce our operating costs over time. We continue to upgrade existing diesel- and petrol-powered units with more\nenergy-efficient, hybrid and renewable energy-powered network equipment and, where practical, increase the number of base\ntransceiver stations situated outside to reduce the energy use involved in keeping them cool. In some markets we share tower\ncapacity with other operators, which has had a direct positive impact on our energy consumption and our environmental footprint.\nWe keep abreast of local environmental legislation and strive to reduce the environmental impact of our operations through\nresponsible use of natural resources and by reducing waste and emissions.\nOur operating companies continue to develop innovative solutions to reduce energy intensity, such as powering\ntelephone exchange stations on solar energy, installing state-of-the-art on-grid photovoltaic systems and carrying out training on\nrenewable energy solutions to ensure stakeholders are aware of our carbon– and cost-saving benefits. Across our organization,\nwe continued working on reducing the carbon footprint of our offices, with a variety of initiatives including switching to LED\nlighting. Additionally, our recent decision to encourage hybrid working as a permanent change to our HR policy at our Amsterdam\nand Dubai offices will enable us to make an additional contribution to reducing the carbon footprint of our headquarters function.\n1 The use by VEON of any MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC or its affiliates (“MSCI”) data, and the use of MSCI logos, trademarks, service marks or index names herein,\ndo not constitute a sponsorship, endorsement, recommendation, or promotion of VEON by MSCI.

MSCI names and logos are trademarks or service marks of MSCI.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWithin ESG, a particular focus for the Company, as a major employer, is diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I). In\nDecember 2022, the Company appointed Ana de Kok Reyes as Group Diversity and Inclusion officer to strengthen our\ncommitment to DE&I, ensuring our vision is aligned across our footprint and deploying best practices across our workforce. In\n2023, the Company also adopted a 360-degree approach to DE&I which considers a multitude of perspectives which captures\npeople, product, partner and community.\nWe have also undertaken a number of DE&I initiatives at the operating company level. For example, in 2023, Jazz, our\noperating company in Pakistan, launched an industry-first program for female leadership development in collaboration with the\ncountry’s top business school in hopes of addressing the gender leadership gap. This five-year program provides scholarship for\nleadership development training programs and aims to train 1,000 women leaders to serve the nation by 2028. At Jazz, we have\nalso adopted “She’s Back,” which is a women returnship platform for bringing women back to work after a career break. In our\nKazakhstan operating company, we have implemented initiatives that provide or promote the establishment of waiting rooms for\nchildren in major offices, remote and hybrid work schedules, access to educational platforms during maternity/paternity leave and\nmaternity leave pay above the mandatory minimum level to help parents and women stay productive and build fulfilling careers\nwithout sacrificing their family lives.\nEU Taxonomy Regulation\nThis section below is specifically prepared from view of VEON Ltd., the ultimate shareholder of the Company and are\nnot applicable to VEON Holdings B.V.\nIn 2019, the European Commission (EC) presented the Green Deal of the European Union (EU), to reach a climate-\nneutral EU economy by 2050 – an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a GHG-reduction of 55%\nimplemented in 2030.\nIn this context, the EU Taxonomy Regulation became effective mid-2020 (Regulation (EU) 2020/852), which up to now\nhas been supplemented and amended by Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2021/2139, 2021/2178, 2023/2485 and\n2023/2486). The EU Taxonomy is mandatory when assessing and considering economic activities ‘environmentally sustainable’\nin line with the Article 3 of the Regulation (EU) 2020/852.\nThe EU published a catalog of sustainable activities in the manner of the EU Taxonomy ('EU Catalog') relating to six\nsustainability objectives as stated in Article 9 of the Regulation (EU) 2020/852: climate change mitigation; climate change\nadaptation; sustainable use of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control;\nprotection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\nBy Delegated Regulations (EU) 2021/2139 Article 1, it is determined which economic activities can be considered. By\nimplementing the first stage of the EU’s taxonomy in 2021 (reporting on eligibility for potentially sustainable activities), we\nconcluded that the impact of the framework in relation to the first two environmental objectives is limited under VEON’s business\n45\nmodel. As of 2022, it was required to report if eligible activities on the first two environmental objectives can be considered\n‘environmentally sustainable’, i.e. Taxonomy-aligned.\nThis alignment depends on technical screening criteria that must be fulfilled as mentioned in Annexure referred to in the\nArticle 1 of Delegated Regulations (EU) 2021/2139. These technical screening criteria determine the conditions under which an\neconomic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to environmental objectives - and determine whether that economic\nactivity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives and comply with minimum safeguards. As of June\n2023, the remaining four of the six objectives have been added. Regarding new activities prescribed: this has little impact on\nVEON.\nWe performed an analysis based on the activities and criteria as described in the relevant Delegated Act (Annexure I\nreferred to in Article 1 of the EU 2021/2139) for each theme to determine substantial contribution (SC) and substantiate the do no\nsignificant harm criterion (DNSH). The third criterion is compliance with minimum social safeguards: here we performed an\nanalysis on three levels: product level, organizational level and responsible supply chain level.\nOn product level, reference was made to eligible product passports or supplier-self-declaration when available. In the\nnon-EU market activities of VEON, these eligible product passports or supplier declarations are not always available (yet). On\norganizational level VEON’s risk management and incident reports were analyzed. Compliance with minimum safeguards is\nenforced by suppliers accepting the VEON Supplier Code of Conduct and in case of shortcomings by corrective actions.\nJudgments and assumptions made by management regarding the EU Taxonomy\nBased on our assessment of the current EU Taxonomy Regulation, we conclude that various aspects are open to\nmultiple interpretations. In preparation of the required EU Taxonomy disclosures, management made judgments and\nassumptions. We concluded that we have eligible activities in one out of six environmental objectives stated in Article 9 of the\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852: climate change mitigation. The amount and proportion of eligible, aligned, and non-eligible activities\nare reported in the tables on the next pages.\nWe conclude that the below economic activities described in the EU Taxonomy apply to VEON as eligible. Based on our\nassessment we found that our eligible 2022 economic activities cannot be considered ‘environmentally sustainable’, i.e.\nTaxonomy-aligned. For 2023 we have found a small portion of our activities related to maintenance and repair of energy efficient\nequipment to be ‘environmentally sustainable’.\nClimate change mitigation eligible activities\n4.2 - Energy generation using concentrated solar power technology\n6.5 - Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles\n7.3 - Installation, maintenance, and repair of energy efficiency equipment\n7.6 – Installation, maintenance, and repair of renewable energy technologies\n7.7 - Acquisition and ownership of buildings\n8.1 - Data processing, hosting, and related activities\nClimate change mitigation alignment analysis\nOn November 24, 2022, VEON announced the sale of its Russian operations, and the Russian business was, in line\nwith the IFRS 5, (Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations,) requirements, treated as a discontinued\noperation, and accounted for as an “Asset held for sale (refer to Note 10 —Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations in our\nConsolidated Financial Statements for further details). The Turnover, Operational expenditure (Opex) and Capital expenditure\n(Capex) in this disclosure exclude our Russian operations. In 2023, our Russian operations did not include eligible taxonomy\nturnover, nor taxonomy aligned Opex or Capex.\nClimate change mitigation means the process of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below\n2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, as laid down in the Paris Agreement. Below we describe\nthe nature of our Taxonomy eligible and aligned economic activities.\nThe eligible capital and operating expenditure includes those that are related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-\naligned economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to GHG-\nreductions. To determine whether eligible activities are Taxonomy aligned, the activities were assessed to the 3 alignment\ncriteria:\n1. Substantial contribution (SC) to climate change mitigation\n2. Does not do significant harm (DNSH) to climate change adaptation, nor to transition to a circular economy and/or\npollution prevention and control\n3. Compliance with minimum safeguards\nWe found our Taxonomy aligned 2023 Opex and Capex economic activities in relation to climate change mitigation to be\nnegligible (0%). The proportion of 2023 eligible, aligned, and non-eligible climate change mitigation activities are reported below\nin terms of EU Taxonomy Opex and Capex:\nTable 1 - Proportion of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-non-eligible economic activities 2023\n46\nProportion of Taxonomy- Proportion of Taxonomy-non-\neligible economic eligible economic activities\nTotal (USD million)* activities (in %)\n(in %)\nTurnover 3,698 — % 100 %\nOperating expenditure (Opex) (2,770) 0.03 % 99.97 %\nCapital expenditure (Capex) 998 10.33 % 89.67 %\n*Note: FY 2023 Turnover, Opex, and Capex amounts exclude Russian operations, which were reclassified as ‘held for sale’ and ‘discontinued\noperations’ in 2022, Refer Note 10- Held for sale and discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEU Taxonomy Turnover KPI\nWe concluded that VEON’s eligible EU Taxonomy Turnover is nil, as VEON's core economic activities are not described\nin the Delegated Acts on the six environmental objectives.\nIn addition, as electronic communications networks (telecommunication) as such are not included as an activity under\nthe current coverage of the Taxonomy delegated act, management is not able to qualify certain network roll-out activities as\nenvironmentally sustainable under the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Industry alignment on treatment of this topic is ongoing.\nAs our core economic activities are not covered by the listed activities in Annex I of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU)\n2021/2139) and are consequently Taxonomy-non-eligible, we have not performed Taxonomy-Alignment assessment for turnover.\nOur assessment of Taxonomy-eligibility is focused on economic activities defined as the provision of goods or services\non a market, thus (potentially) generating revenues. In this context, we, as a telecommunications group, define voice, fixed\nbroadband, data- and digital services as the core of our business activities.\nWe define activities such as the acquisition/construction of new buildings (for our shops, front and back offices,\nwarehouses, data centers) and towers or the transport for our administrative and engineering staff as support activities for our\ncore business activities. They are not reported as Taxonomy-eligible activities and not included in our turnover KPI as they are\nnot generating external turnover on a standalone basis.\nAccounting Policies\nThe key performance indicators (“KPIs”) include the turnover KPI, the Opex KPI and the Capex KPI. The specification of the\nKPIs is determined in accordance with Annex I of the Art. 8 Delegated Act. We describe our accounting policy in this regard as\nfollows:\nTurnover KPI\nThe proportion of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities in our total turnover has been calculated as the part of net\nturnover derived from products and services associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities (numerator) divided by the\nnet turnover (denominator). The denominator of the turnover KPI is based on our consolidated net turnover in accordance with\nIAS 1.82(a). For further details on our accounting policies regarding our consolidated net turnover, please refer to Note 24 of our\nAnnual Report 2023. With regard to the numerator, under the current environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy, climate\nchange mitigation, VEON had no eligible 2023 turnover-generating activities.\nOpex KPI\nThe Opex KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible Opex (numerator) divided by our total Opex (denominator). With regard\nto the numerator, we refer to our explanations below. Total Opex consists of direct non-capitalized costs that relate to purchase of\nrenewable energy, short-term lease, and maintenance and repair of equipment.\nCapex KPI\nThe Capex KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible Capex (numerator) divided by our total Capex (denominator). With\nregard to the numerator, we refer to our explanations below.\nTotal Capex consists of additions to Property and Equipment and Intangible assets during the financial year. Total\nCapex can be reconciled to our consolidated financial statements as the reference to the sum of total Additions line of Note 12\nand Note 13.\n47\nExplanations on the numerator of the Opex KPI and the Capex KPI\nOpex and Capex with regard to support activities are included in table 2 and 3 below - and were considered for\ncalculating of the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-non-eligible economic activities in Opex and Capex (Table 1).\nFor the allocation of Opex and Capex management have identified the relevant purchases and measures and identified\nthe primarily related economic activity in the Climate Delegated Act. In this way, no Opex or Capex was considered more than\nonce. Of 2023 Opex, a negligible percentage of 0.002% (2022: 0%) is considered aligned under the current EU Taxonomy\nRegulations (Annex I referred to in Article 1 of Delegated Regulations (EU) 2021/2139), 0% of 2023 Capex is considered aligned\n(2022: 0%). This low percentage of alignment is partly related to unavailability of product certifications regarding purchased\ngoods and services in VEON’s non-EU core markets. A higher percentage of aligned activities from elements of Opex and Capex\ncould have existed, but management was not able to validate such alignment due to lack of substantial information available.\nWe have identified the following economic activities in the Climate Delegated Act (Article 1) resulting in Opex which are\nconsidered eligible:\nTable 2 - Individually Taxonomy-eligible Opex and the respective 2023 economic activities\nDescription of the individually Taxonomy-eligible Respective economic activity (s) Amount,\npurchased output/measure USD million\nPurchase of electricity generated from renewables 4.2. Electricity generation using concentrated solar -0.16\npower (CSP) technology\nVehicle fleet (leasing) 6.5. Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light -0.6\ncommercial vehicles\nMaintenance and repair of the energy efficient 7.3. Installation, maintenance, and repair of energy -0.05\nequipment related to base stations efficiency equipment\nTotal (0.8)*\n* 2023 Opex related to climate change limitation is limited to 0.03% of 2023 Opex and considered immaterial. The results of the management’s\nanalyses are therefore not included in this disclosure.\nWe have identified the following economic activities in the Climate Delegated Act (Article 1) resulting in Capex which are\nconsidered eligible:\nTable 3 - Individually Taxonomy-eligible Capex and the respective 2023 economic activities\nDescription of the individually Taxonomy-eligible Respective economic activity (Annex I to Climate Amount,\npurchased output/measure Delegated Act) USD million\nMaintenance and repair of energy efficient equipment 7.3.

Also,\nwe concluded that the roll-out of fiber is currently not eligible, however we believe this is an important enabler for climate change\nmitigation, by providing significant energy savings compared to copper.\nFurthermore, we found our Taxonomy eligible and aligned 2023 Opex-economic activities in relation to climate change\nmitigation to be negligible (2022: 0%) and that 2023 aligned Capex was 0% in both 2022 and 2023.\nThe proportion of 2023 eligible, aligned, and non-eligible climate change mitigation activities are reported below in terms\nof EU Taxonomy Opex and Capex.\nOf 2023 Opex, 0.00% is considered aligned under the current EU Taxonomy Regulations, 0.00% of Capex is\nconsidered aligned. This low percentage of alignment is partly related to unavailability of product certifications regarding\npurchased goods and services in VEON’s non-EU core markets. A higher percentage of aligned activities from elements of Opex\nand Capex could have existed, but management was not able to validate such alignment due to lack of substantial information\navailable.\nEU Taxonomy Turnover table\nSubstantial contribution Does not significant harm\ncriteria (DNSH)\nsedoC\nDSU\nni(\nrevonruT\netulosbA\n)noillim\nrevonruT\nfo\nnoitroporP\nnoitagitim\negnahc\netamilC\nnoitatpada\negnahc\netamilC\nretaW noitulloP\nymonoce\nralucriC\nytisrevidoiB\nnoitagitim\negnahc\netamilC\nnoitatpada\negnahc\netamilC\nretaW noitulloP\nymonoce\nralucriC\nytisrevidoiB\nsdraugefas\nmuminiM\nfo\nnoitroporp\ndengila\nymonoxaT\n3202\nrevonruT\nytivitca\n.lbane\nyrogetaC\nytivitca\n.snart\nyrogetaC\nA.

Our global headquarters activities are currently hosted in Amsterdam which consists\nof a 1020 square meter office with 33 workplaces, and we have subleased parts of our Amsterdam office since February 2020.\nOn December 31, 2022, we entered into a lease for office space in the DIFC consisting of 500 square meters with 26\nworkspaces. Our DIFC office became operational in mid-June 2023 at which time we closed our small satellite office in Dubai\nInternet City which preciously opened in March 2022. On October 14, 2024, we announced our intention to relocate our Group\nheadquarter activities from Amsterdam to the DIFC . Our London office at 15 Bonhill Street, London EC2A 4DN has been fully\nsubleased since January 2019, and accordingly, we no longer have any designated office space in London. Our operating\ncompanies and subsidiaries each own and lease property used for a variety of functions, including administrative offices,\ntechnical centers, data centers, call centers, warehouses, operating facilities, sales offices, main switches for our networks and\nIT centers. We also own office buildings in some of our regional license areas and lease space on an as-needed basis.\nTelecommunications Equipment and Operations\nThe primary elements of our material tangible fixed assets are our networks.\nMobile network infrastructure\nOur mobile networks, which use mainly Ericsson, Huawei, ZTE and Nokia equipment, are integrated wireless networks\nof radio base station equipment, circuit and packet core equipment and digital wireless switches connected by fixed microwave\ntransmission links, fiber optic cable links and leased lines. We select suppliers based mainly on compliance with technical and\nfunctional requirements and total cost.\nSince late 2019, as part of our “infrastructure” strategy, we have been focused on optimizing our tower portfolio by\nselling certain mobile tower assets and concurrently entering into lease arrangements with the buyer for the same assets,\nthereby monetizing our asset base while increasing operating costs.\nFor the mobile network structure that we do not own, we enter into agreements for the location of base stations in the\nform of either leases or cooperation agreements that provide us with the use of certain spaces for our base stations and\nequipment. Under these leases or cooperation agreements, we typically have the right to use such property to place our towers\nand equipment shelters. We are also party to certain network managed services agreements to maintain our networks and\ninfrastructure.\nWe also enter into agreements with other operators for radio network sharing, where we either share the passive\nequipment, physical site and towers or combine the operation of the radio equipment with other operators. Network sharing\nbrings not only substantial savings on site rentals and maintenance costs but also on investments in equipment for the rollout of\nnew base stations.\nFixed-lined infrastructure\nOur infrastructure supports our mobile businesses in all of our markets and enables provision of fixed-line services to\nour customers in Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Our infrastructure in these markets include: a transport network designed\nand continually developed to carry voice, data and internet traffic of mobile network, FTTB and our fixed-line customers using\nfiber optics and microwave links; and a transport network based on our optical cable network utilizing DWDM, SDH and IP/MPLS\nequipment with all DWDM and SDH optical networks being fully ring-protected (except for secondary towns).\n51\nFor more information on our property, plants and equipment, see Note 12—Property and Equipment to our Audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nDIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES\nDirectors and Senior Management\nThe statutory directors of VEON Holdings B.V. are Kaan Terzioğlu, Jochem Postma and Paul Klaassen.

On May 31, 2024, VEON Ltd. further amended and restated their bye-laws to\ncorrect a legacy formatting error and to standardize the wording enabling the VEON Ltd. Board of Directors to convene electronic\nmeetings of shareholders.\nVEON Ltd.'s bye-laws empower the Board of Directors to direct the management of VEON Ltd.’s business and affairs,\nand require that the Board of Directors approves important matters including, among others, the annual budget and audited\naccounts, organizational or reporting changes to the management structure, significant transactions and changes to share capital\nor other significant actions of the group of subsidiary companies for which VEON Ltd. is the ultimate parent entity (“VEON\nGroup”). Additionally, under Bermuda law, the Board of Directors has the right to require that any matter be brought to the\nattention of the Board of Directors for approval and any member of the Board of Directors may bring forward an item for the\nagenda of a meeting of the Board of Directors. Together, these decision-making channels help to ensure that the Board of\nDirectors provides appropriate oversight over matters relevant to the VEON Group.\nUpdates to the VEON Ltd.

In order to ensure alignment with the long-term interests of the VEON Ltd.'s shareholders,\nthe VEON Ltd. RGC, evaluated the compensation of the VEON Ltd.'s Board of Directors and the GEC during the period taking\ninto account the competitive landscape, the compensation of directors at other comparable companies and recommendations\nregarding best practices. Following review by the RGC, it made recommendations to the VEON Ltd. Board of Directors on the\ncompensation of the VEON Ltd. Board of Directors and the GEC.\nWe incurred remuneration expense in respect of our directors and senior managers in an aggregate amount of\napproximately US$22 million for services provided during 2023. For more information regarding our director and senior\nmanagement compensation, including individual remuneration amounts for each our directors and senior managers, see Note 21\n—Related Parties to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The remuneration received by the VEON's non-executive\ndirectors was in compliance with the Board fee structure established by the VEON\nTo stimulate and reward leadership efforts that result in sustainable success, value growth cash and equity-based multi-\nyear incentive plans (“Incentive Plans”) were designed for members of our recognized leadership community. The participants in\nthe Incentive Plans may receive cash payouts or share awards after the end of each relevant award performance period. These\nIncentive Plans are key in aligning the interests of the members of our leadership team with the long-term success of VEON as\nwell as shareholders’ interests while also acting as a tool to enhance retention among our leadership team. VEON’s non-\nexecutive directors did not receive variable remuneration and did not participate in the Company’s incentive plans in 2023. To\nensure that the interests of the VEON’s non-executive directors are aligned with those of the shareholders and that their\nremuneration supports the long-term company performance, in 2023 VEON introduced the new Board fee structure, whereby a\ncertain portion of the Board of Directors’ compensation is paid in the VEON shares which can be settled in either equity or cash\ndepending on the circumstances.\nVEON has adopted a malus and claw back policy in respect of short-term and long-term incentives. The provisions of\nthe policy allow the Group to reduce or recoup short-term or long-term incentives awards in the event of fraud or gross\nnegligence by an employee (“trigger events”). Malus applies before awards have vested or been paid to an employee while claw\nback applies for a period of three years from the date the award has vested or payment has been made to an employee. In\naddition, the Company has adopted a policy with respect to the Clawback Policy, effective from October 2, 2023. The Clawback\nPolicy applies to “incentive-based compensation” (i.e. compensation that is granted/earned/vested based wholly or in part upon\nthe attainment of financial reporting measures, including stock price and total shareholder return) and provides a mechanism\nwhereby the VEON, in response to the restatement of its financial statements, claw-back any compensation received by an\nexecutive officer which exceeds the amount of incentive-based compensation that executive would have otherwise received had\nsuch compensation been determined based on the restated financial figures.\nShort-Term Incentive Plan\nThe Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”) provides cash pay-outs and share rewards to participating employees based\non the achievement of established Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) over the period of one calendar year. Under the STIP\nScheme the target award for a Group CEO is 125% of annual base salary and for the remainder of the executives is 100% of\nannual base salary, delivered 50% cash and 50% shares with the 50% share element restricted for two years. The shares are\nrestricted for two years after grant with no further performance conditions. The maximum opportunity for the executive is 120% of\nthe target level. KPIs are set every year at the beginning of the year and evaluated in the first quarter of the next year. The KPIs\nare partially based on the operational performance (50%), financial health (30%) and strategic projects (20%) of the Company. In\n2023, operational performance KPIs consist of total operating revenue (20%), EBITDA (20%), and cost intensity (10%). The\nweight of each KPI was decided on an individual basis and pay-out of the STI award was dependent upon final approval by the\nRGC. Based on results achieved for the year 2023, the RGC has confirmed that all of the set targets for this year were generally\nachieved.\nThe cash pay-out of the STIP award is scheduled in March of the year following the assessment year and is subject to\ncontinued active employment during the year of assessment (except in limited “good leaver” circumstances in which case there\nis a pro-rata reduction) and is also subject to a pro-rata reduction if the participant commenced employment after the start of the\nyear of assessment. The share awards are also scheduled to be granted in March of the year following the assessment year and\nsubject to the same conditions. Both the cash pay-out of the STIP award as well as any share awards granted were dependent\nupon final approval by the RGC.\nLong-Term Incentive Plan\nThe LTIP is granted in a rolling three-year performance cycle and subject to a three year vesting period from the date of\nthe grant as well as a performance condition related to target shareholder return in line with shareholder interests. The target\nshareholder return performance condition is relative to a customized peer group of companies. The threshold level (50% of the\non-target award) is achieved at the median of the peer group and maximum payout (200% of the on-target award) at\nperformance in the top quartile of the peer group. In respect of the Company’s 2021-2023 LTIP awards, vested on December 31,\n2023, the RGC has assessed that the target shareholder return performance condition has not been satisfied, accordingly no\npayout will be initiated to the proposed award recipients. For the Company’s 2021–2023 LTIP award, which was vested on\nDecember 31, 2023, the RGC confirmed that the targets for the target shareholder return have not been met, and, therefore, no\npayout will be executed in respect thereof.\n57\nVesting of certain of our share awards are based on the attainment of certain KPIs, such as absolute share price, etc.\nOptions may be exercised by the participant at any time during a defined exercise period, subject to the Company’s insider\ntrading policy.\nDeferred Share Plan (“DSP”)\nThe Deferred Share Plan (DSP) is an equity-settled scheme established in 2021, which enables the Board to award\noptions to the selected staff (participants) on a discretionary basis at no cost to the participants. The awards are conditional on\nthe ongoing employment for a specified period, typically a two-year vesting period.\nOther\nExecutive shareholding requirements are set at six times annual base salary for the Group CEO and two times annual\nbase salary for the Group CFO and Group General Counsel. There is no post-employment holding period for the Group CFO and\nGroup General Counsel, while the Group CEO must maintain his shareholding requirement for two years post-employment. The\nrationale behind the shareholding requirements is to align executive and shareholder interests by creating personal holdings of\nVEON equity.\nSee Note 21—Related Parties to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our various\nIncentive Plans.\nPursuant to our bye-laws, we indemnify and hold harmless our directors and senior managers from and against all\nactions, costs, charges, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses in connection with any act done, concurred in or omitted in the\nexecution of our business, or their duty, or supposed duty, or in their respective offices or trusts, to the extent authorized by law.\nWe may also advance moneys to our directors and officers for costs, charges and expenses incurred by any of them in\ndefending any civil or criminal proceedings. The foregoing indemnity will not apply (and any funds advanced will be required to\nbe repaid) with respect to a director or officer if any allegation of fraud or dishonesty is proved against such director or officer. We\nhave also entered into separate indemnification agreements with our directors and senior managers pursuant to which we have\nagreed to indemnify each of them within substantially the same scope as provided in the bye-laws.\nWe have obtained insurance on behalf of our senior managers and directors for liability arising out of their actions in\ntheir capacity as a senior manager or director and we did not make any distributions to the Company’s Board of Directors in 2023\nas a result of any termination of employment. Further, there are currently no loans, advances or guarantees outstanding on\nbehalf of any director of the Company.\nWe do not have any pension, retirement or similar benefit plans available to our directors or senior managers and we\ndid not make any distributions to the Company directors in 2023 on termination of employment or any payments for pension\nobligations, early retirement arrangements or sabbaticals.

GEC consisted of Kaan Terzioglu, Omiyinka Doris, and Joop Brakenhoff with all other VEON Ltd.\nGEC members stepping down from their executive roles effective October 1, 2023.\nBoard Practices\nVEON Ltd. is governed by our Board of Directors, consisting of seven directors. Our bye-laws provide that our Board of\nDirectors shall consist of at least five and no more than nine directors, as determined by the Board of Directors and subject to\n59\napproval by a majority of the shareholders voting in person or by proxy at a general meeting. We have not entered into any\nservice contracts with any of our current directors providing for benefits upon termination of service.\nThe Board of Directors has delegated to the Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) the power to manage the business and\naffairs of the company, subject to certain material business decisions reserved for the Board of Directors or shareholders in our\nbye-laws, within the framework of our new governance model announced in the third quarter of 2020. The CEO and his\nleadership team manage and operate the company on a day-to-day basis. The Board of Directors may appoint such other senior\nexecutives as the Board may determine.\nUnder the new governance model, our Board of Directors and the CEO have delegated to each VEON operating\ncompany considerable authority to operate their businesses independently. A Group Authority Matrix and updated policy\nframework has also been implemented, establishing clear decision-making parameters, reporting and other requirements.\nSpecifically, each operating company is accountable for operating its own business subject to oversight by their respective\noperating company boards and our Board of Directors; and they are also obligated to operate in accordance with Group policy\nand controls framework. The new governance model forms the cornerstone of governance and delegation of authority across the\nGroup.\nThe Board of Directors has established a number of committees to support it in review and fulfillment of the Board’s\noversight and governance duties. The charters establishing these committees set out the purpose, membership, meeting\nrequirement, authorities and responsibilities of the committees.\nVEON has adopted the criteria set forth in the Enterprise Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and\nPerformance – 2017, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), as the\nfoundation of our enterprise risk management (ERM) approach. Through VEON’s ERM framework, we aim to identify, assess,\nadequately manage, monitor and report risks that could jeopardize the achievement of our strategic objectives. On an annual\nbasis, our GEC, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board of Directors define our risk profile for the categories of risk we\nencounter in operating our business, which are then integrated into our business through global policies and procedures. Our\nGEC review significant risks assessed and prioritized based on the Group’s ERM framework. The top Group risks are also\nreported to the Board of Directors, in particular to the Audit and Risk Committee (at least on a quarterly basis), to evaluate\nmaterial Group risks. In line with our new governance model, local risk assessments are also reviewed by the senior\nmanagement of each operating company and are reported to the business risk committees of our operating companies (the\n“BRCs”) and the boards of our operating companies (“OpCo Boards”). The Board of Directors maintains the Audit and Risk\nCommittee, OpCo Boards and BRCs, to provide independent oversight of the ERM framework and the timely follow-up on critical\nactions based on the progress updates.\nIn the composition of our Board of Directors and senior executives, we are committed to diversity of nationality, age,\neducation, gender and professional background. In March 2021, we implemented a diversity and inclusion policy to formalize our\ncommitment to diversity and inclusion at the Board of Directors’ level and throughout the organization.\nOn August 6, 2021, the SEC approved the NASDAQ Stock Market’s proposal to amend its listing standards to\nencourage greater board diversity and to require board diversity disclosures for NASDAQ-listed companies. Pursuant to the\namended listing standards, we, as a foreign private issuer, are required to have at least two diverse Board members or explain\nthe reasons for not meeting this objective, starting with a phase-in during 2023 (at least one diverse Board member) that lasts\nuntil 2026 (at least two diverse Board members including at least one Board member who self-identifies as female). Furthermore,\na Board of Directors diversity matrix is required to be included in the Annual Report containing certain demographic and other\ninformation regarding members of the Board of Directors. To see our Board of Directors’ diversity matrix prior to our 2023 annual\ngeneral meeting held on June 29, 2023, please see Item 6.C—Board Practices from our 2022 Form 20-F filed with the SEC on\nJuly 24, 2023 (our “2022 20-F”).

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we\nhave filed a registration statement on Form F-3 with the SEC using a “shelf” registration process. However, our shelf registration\nstatement was rendered ineffective as a result of the delay in our filing of this Annual Report on Form 20-F, for which periodic\nreporting is required under the Exchange Act to be filed on time to utilize a “shelf” registration process. As a result, in the event\nany of our shareholders under the Registration Rights Agreement elect to exercise their registration rights, we will likely incur\nadditional expense to register such securities until we are able to once again utilize a Form F-3.\nWe have also agreed to endeavor to include any applicable VEON common shares awarded to Impact Investments that\nare not freely tradable on any registration statement filed by VEON Ltd. or any of its subsidiaries under the Securities Act during\nthe term of the 2024 Agreement (defined below) and for 12 months following its termination.

On June 7, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Agreement with Impact\nInvestments, which will provide strategic support and board advisory services to VEON Ltd. and JSC Kyivstar (a wholly owned\nindirect subsidiary of VEON). On June 7, 2024, we also entered into a termination letter with Impact Investments in connection\nwith a letter agreement between VEON Ltd., JSC Kyivstar and Impact Investments dated November 16, 2023, and subsequently\nawarded shares pursuant to the termination letter. See Note 22—Events After the Reporting Period—Agreement with Impact\nInvestments LLC for Strategic Support and Board Advisory Service to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more\ninformation about our transactions with Impact Investments\n67\nHOW WE MANAGE RISKS\nVEON has adopted the criteria set forth in the Enterprise Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and Performance – 2017,\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), as the foundation of our enterprise\nrisk management (ERM) approach. Through VEON’s ERM framework, our management aims to identify, assess, adequately\nmanage, monitor and report risks that could jeopardize the achievement of our strategic objectives. The VEON ERM framework\nis implemented and consistently applied throughout the organization through a well-defined governance structure and a robust\nERM process. The ERM framework also supports identifying opportunities that enable us to achieve our strategic objectives and\nenable sustainable growth.\nStrengthening our risk culture: three lines of defense\nThe ‘three lines of defense’ approach provides a simple and effective way to enhance communications around governance, risk\nmanagement and control by clarifying roles and responsibilities. VEON has adopted this model to provide reasonable assurance\nthat risks to achieving strategic objectives are identified and mitigated.\nFirst line of defense\nVEON recognizes that the first line of defense consists of the business, who owns and is responsible and accountable\nfor directly assessing, controlling and mitigating risks. Since 2016, targeted communication campaigns have been launched\nglobally to foster risk and control awareness across the Group.\nTo embed a culture aligned to our risk appetite and individual responsibilities in relation to risk management we\nembarked on a program in 2019 which continued through 2023. This program involved an awareness campaign using sport,\ngames and the idea of teamwork to highlight the importance of every individual’s contribution to effective risk management and a\nstrong control environment, which was launched to reinforce accountability and ownership for risk management and the internal\ncontrol environment. During 2022, a Risk Culture survey assessment was performed for the second time since 2021, across our\noperating companies (OpCos) and our HQ with the help of an external consultancy firm. This exercise was aimed at supporting\nmanagement in assessing the risk culture within the organization based on eight risk culture dimensions, and to identify potential\nactions to strengthen or improve VEON’s risk culture in comparison with an external benchmark. Based on the results of the\nsurvey, all risk culture dimensions at VEON outperformed the external consultant’s benchmark with exception of two that were in\nline with the external consultant’s benchmark, which demonstrates a continued very positive outcome. To further improve risk\nculture and capitalise on survey results, a set of recommendations was provided by the external consultant tailored for each\nOpCo and HQ based on the assessment of each of the eight risk culture dimensions. The recommendations were not mandatory\nin nature but were embraced as an opportunity to ensure a continuous improvement in risk culture and served as the basis for\naction plans development. Status of the action plans and progress of the OpCos was tracked periodically and reported to each\nOpCos’ Business Risk Committees (BRC) until completion. The Risk Culture survey is expected to be conducted again in 2025\nwith the primary objective of systematically assessing and evaluating the progress and development of our risk culture within\neach operating company.\nSecond line of defense\nThe second line of defense monitors and facilitates the implementation of effective risk management practices and\ninternal controls by the first line. The second line comprises Group Internal Control, Group Enterprise Risk Management, Group\nEthics and Compliance and Group Legal, amongst other Group functions. The second line supports the business functions in\nidentifying what could go wrong and provides the methods, tools and guidance necessary to support the first line in managing\ntheir risks.\nGroup ERM provides general oversight on ERM activities in the OpCos, such as quarterly risk reporting as well as\nfacilitating the Group functions with the performance of regular deep dives on specific risks, for example, Regulatory and Tax\nrisks, and assessments of Anti-bribery and Corruption (ABC), Anti-money Laundering (AML), and International Sanctions and\nExport Controls risks. The ERM process is also embedded into the strategy setting and business planning process to ensure\nconsistency and completeness of VEON’s risk profile and that informed risk-based decisions are taken. Group ERM also\nprovides guidance on ERM reporting to the OpCo BRCs and leads the annual process of reviewing and revising VEON’s Risk\nAppetite with the VEON Group Executive Committee members, approving it with the Group CEO and presenting the outcome to\nthe ARC. The Risk Appetite is then formally communicated to OpCos for local application in decision making and submission of\nbusiness decision approvals to their respective OpCo Board.\nThird line of defense\nThe Group Internal Audit function comprises the third line of defense and is responsible for providing independent\nassurance to senior management on the effectiveness of the first and second lines of defense. The function conducts financial,\ninformation technology, strategic and operational audits in accordance with its annual plan and special investigations or audits,\nas and when considered necessary. Throughout, Internal Audit conducts its activities in a manner based on a continuous\nevaluation of perceived business risks.\n68\nDefining our risk appetite\nDefining our risk appetite in line with the COSO Framework, the VEON Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework\ngroups risk into four risk categories: Strategic, Operational, Financial and Compliance.\nOur risk appetite is defined for each of the four risk categories by considering our strategic and business objectives, as\nwell as potential threats to achieving these objectives. On an annual basis, the VEON appetite statements for each category of\nrisk are revised and approved by the VEON Group Executive Committee and presented to the ARC. These statements are then\nintegrated into the business through our group policies and procedures and our risk management cycle.\nRisk Appetite Table\nRisk Management in Execution\nEffective risk management requires a continuous and iterative process and involves the following five steps:\n1. Clarify objectives and identify risks:\nVEON’s strategy is developed with a comprehensive understanding of the inherent risks involved in doing business. We\nconsider the potential effects of the business context on our risk profile as well as possible ways of mitigating the risks we are\nexposed to.\n2. Assess and prioritize risks:\nRisks identified as relevant for VEON are assessed in order to understand the severity of each risk on the ability to\nexecute VEON’s strategy and business objectives. The severity of risk is assessed at multiple levels of the business as it may\nvary same across functions and operating companies.\n69\n3. Respond to risk:\nThe assessed severity of the risk is utilized by management to determine an appropriate risk response (Take, Treat,\nTransfer or Terminate) which may include implementing mitigations, taking into account the risk appetite.\n4. Monitor, report and escalate:\nVEON’s Group Executive Committee review significant risks assessed and prioritised based on the Group’s ERM\nframework. The top Group risks are also reported to VEON’s Board of Directors, in particular to the ARC (at least on a quarterly\nbasis), to evaluate material Group risks. Top Group risks include HQ-specific risks, as well as consolidated assessment of key\nrisks from the OpCos. Local risk assessments are also reviewed by OpCo CEO and senior management and are reported to the\nBRCs and OpCo Boards.\nThe Board of Directors, including the ARC as a board committee, OpCo Boards and BRCs each provide independent\noversight of the ERM framework and ensure timely follow-up on critical actions based on progress updates provided.\nTo ensure strong governance and oversight of our risks, we established in each of our OpCos a BRC and an OpCo\nBoard. Each OpCo’s BRC, is chaired by either the Group Chief Financial Officer, his nominee or the Head of Internal Audit. The\npurpose of the OpCo BRCs is to consider the overall risk profile of the OpCo and the Group and ensure risk informed decision\nmaking. The OpCo BRC regularly reviews the OpCo’s governance and decision-making framework and compliance with VEON\nGroup and OpCo requirements, including those set out in the VEON Group Authority Matrix/Delegation as well as VEON Group\npolicies. Each BRC also receives, reviews and makes recommendations on reports from OpCo management regarding any\nnoncompliance with the VEON Group Authority Matrix/Delegation and VEON Group policies. Each BRC provides active VEON\nGroup-level governance, oversight and policy guidance and aligns the activities of the Group’s various assurance functions to\ncoordinate and manage actions efficiently in support of the local OpCo Board and the VEON Ltd. Board of Directors in its\noversight role for the VEON Group.\nEach of the OpCos are managed by their respective OpCo Board which comprises of the respective OpCo CEO, OpCo\nCFO (or another senior HQ finance representative designated by the Group CFO), members of Group senior management team\nand other individuals approved by the VEON Board. Each OpCo’s overall risk profile is presented to its OpCo Board regularly (at\nleast once per quarter) and is accompanied by recommendations from its OpCo BRC. This program is continuously monitored by\nOpCo management as well as the OpCo Boards, and reviewed by both OpCo and Group Internal Audit, with the ARC providing\nultimate oversight, with each OpCo BRC providing active monitoring and engagement with the OpCos on all enterprise risks,\ncontrol, compliance and assurance matters.\n5. Assure:\nOn a quarterly basis, through our management certification process, OpCo CEOs and CFOs certify that significant risks\nhave been considered and appropriate measures have been taken to manage the identified risks in accordance with the Group’s\nERM policies and procedures, including our risk appetite.\nControl framework\nVEON is publicly traded on a U.S. stock exchange and registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThus, it must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Section 404 of SOX requires that management perform an\nassessment of the Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) and disclosures to confirm both the design and operational\neffectiveness of the controls.\nOur internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation and fair presentation of VEON Ltd.’s published consolidated financial statements under generally accepted\naccounting principles. The VEON ICFR Framework incorporates risk assessment as part of our scoping process, an assessment\nof the design effectiveness of the required controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of the key control activities and\nmonitoring of our financial reporting at entity-wide and functional levels. VEON has established uniform governance, policies and\ncontrol standards that apply to controlled subsidiaries. Our ICFR testing results are reported into our OpCo BRCs, OpCo Boards,\nmembers of our Group Executive Committee, and the ARC at least on a quarterly basis as part of our assurance model. For a\nmore detailed overview of the governance changes in 2023 see Director's Report section in these Financial statements.\nOur Disclosure and Review Committee supports our Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer in\nensuring that public disclosures made by VEON are accurate and complete, fairly present VEON's financial condition and results\nof operations in all material respects, and are made on a timely basis, in compliance with applicable laws, stock exchange rules\nand other regulatory requirements.\nLocal management is responsible for business operations of our subsidiaries, including risk mitigation as well as\ncompliance with laws, regulations and internal policies and requirements. We have created uniform governance and control\nstandards for all our levels of operations. The standards apply to all our subsidiaries with the same expectation: that they conduct\nbusiness in accordance with ethical principles, internal policies and procedures, and applicable laws and regulations. The\nstandards are intended to define and guide conduct with respect to relevant compliance and ethics principles and rules, and to\ncreate awareness about when and where to ask for advice or report a compliance or ethics concern, which includes the use of\nVEON’s SpeakUp channels. The principles apply to all VEON employees in all operating businesses and headquarters.\n70\nEmployees receive annual training on the VEON Code of Conduct (Code), which includes certification to comply with the Code.\nOur group-wide Code applies to all VEON employees, officers and directors, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer. Our Code is available on our website at http://www.veon.com, under \"About Us/Values & Ethics” (information\nappearing on the website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nA Group Authority Matrix/Delegation has been established and is regularly reviewed and updated. It provides clarity on\nthe role and focus of VEON’s corporate HQ, empowers OpCos to ensure they have the appropriate scope of authority and\naccountability to operate and manage local businesses, and ensures requisite oversight and control across the Group by\nVEON’s Group Executive Committee, OpCo CEOs and their respective management teams as well as OpCo Boards and the\nVEON Board of Directors.\nWe have a Group-wide, quarterly management certification process in place, which requires the Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer at each of our OpCos, and certain Group functional directors at our HQ, certify compliance with the\nuniform governance and control standards established in VEON, including:\n• compliance with the Code and related Group policies and procedures, including compliance with VEON’s principles,\nprocedures and policies on ethics and compliance, fraud prevention and detection, accounting and internal control\nstandards, and disclosure requirements;\n• compliance with local laws and regulations;\n• compliance with the VEON Accounting Manual;\n• Business Partner Code of Conduct;\n• internal disclosure obligations; and\n• deficiencies, if applicable, in design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting have been reported\nKey risks table for VEON and examples of mitigation and 2023 developments\nBelow is a summary of the key risks we face in operating our business and a discussion of certain mitigation efforts associated\nwith these risks. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business, see the Risk Factors\nSection of this Annual Report. The risks listed may not be exhaustive, and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known\nto VEON or that it currently deems immaterial, may also have, or develop a material adverse effect on its business, operations,\nfinancial condition or performance, or other interests.\nPrioritization of Strategic, Operational and Financial risks is based on EBITDA business impact’s thresholds and likelihood\nscales from 1 to 5. Once the identified risks are assessed and prioritized based on the above scales, the risk response strategy\n(take, treat, terminate, transfer) is decided and mitigating action plans are defined and/or updated, the outcome of the risk\nassessment information is captured in our Global GRC Tool. The risk response strategy is determined based on the business\ncontext, risk appetite, severity and prioritization. Further the risk response must also consider the anticipated costs and benefits\ncommensurate with the severity and prioritization of the risk and address any obligations and expectations (e.g. industry\nstandards, shareholder expectations, etc.).\nPrioritization of some compliance risks such as Non-compliance to Anti-bribery and corruption laws, and Non-\ncompliance to International Sanction and export laws and regulations is performed qualitatively, due to their nature, based\non external factors sourced from independent non-governmental reports (where possible) and Internal factors sourced from\nVEON’s business processes by the Local Ethics and Compliance and Legal teams.\nThe sequence in which the risks and mitigating actions are presented below are not intended to be in any order of severity,\nchance or materiality.

continue to have, an impact on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nDirect Impact of the War\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and its direct and indirect consequences have impacted and, if the war continues\nor escalates, may continue to significantly impact VEON’s results and aspects of its operations in Ukraine. Due to the nature of\nthe war, we cannot assess with certainty whether events are likely to occur, and events may occur suddenly and without warning.\nSpecifically, the ongoing war has had a marked impact on the economy of Ukraine and has caused partial damage to our sites in\nUkraine. See “—From time to time, we recognize impairment charges in respect of our CGUs, some of which can be substantial,\nincluding the potential impairment charge for our Bangladesh CGU following recent political unrest” and Note—Operating and\nFinancial Review and Prospects. Our operations in Ukraine represented approximately 25% and 22% of our revenue for the year\nended December 31, 2023 and the six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, and related economic sanctions and export control actions against\nRussia, have also led to a surge in certain commodity prices (including wheat, oil and gas) and other inflationary pressures which\nmay have an effect on our customers (and their spending patterns) in the countries in which we operate. If additional sanctions\non fossil fuel exports from Russia are imposed, or the existing sanctions are accelerated or tightened, the price increases for\nrelated products may be exacerbated. Such price increases or other inflationary pressures may cause further strain on our\ncustomers in the countries in which we operate. Rising fuel prices also make it more expensive for us to operate and power our\nnetworks.\nCustomer demand for our services in Ukraine may increase or decrease depending on the fluctuations in the Ukrainian\npopulation as a result of Ukrainians relocating in or out of the country due to the ongoing war. For example, as of June 14, 2024,\nit is estimated by the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees that approximately 6.5 million people have fled Ukraine\nand the country has sustained significant damage to infrastructure and assets. If the ongoing war persists and Ukrainian\nrefugees choose to relocate permanently outside of Ukraine and switch to local providers, we estimate that we could lose\napproximately 1.3 million subscribers (around 5% of our customer base) in Ukraine. This will have a measurable impact on our\ncustomer base in Ukraine, as well as their use and spending on our services. We may also experience fluctuations in the\ndemand for our services if our customers experience difficulties in accessing or using our products and services outside of\nUkraine, either as a result of roaming arrangements with our network providers or as a result of switching to a different provider\non a temporary or permanent basis. We have experienced a decline in revenue generated from international mobile termination\nrates (“MTRs”) charged to Ukrainian customers due to EU policies implemented that regulate roaming charges for Ukrainians.\nWe expect these policies and decrease in rates charged to Ukrainian customers to continue, with Ukraine and the European\nUnion extending, in April 2023, the arrangements for Ukraine’s access to free roaming areas (first introduced in April 2022) for\n2024. Furthermore, the European Commission has continued its efforts to integrate Ukraine into the EU roaming area, which\ncould eliminate roaming charges for Ukrainian customers indefinitely throughout the European Union if adopted.\nWe have also incurred additional maintenance capital expenditures to maintain, and repair damage to, our mobile and\nfixed-line telecommunications infrastructure in Ukraine resulting from the ongoing war. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nour costs related to security, fuel for diesel generators, batteries, mitigation measures (which were aimed at protecting the energy\nindependence of our telecom network in the event of further attacks on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine) and other costs in\nUkraine were approximately UAH 822.0 million (US$22.5 million). In the prior year these costs were approximately UAH770.55\nmillion (US$19 million). As of June 30, 2024 for the year to date, these costs were approximately UAH 55.2 million (US$1.42\nmillion). We expect these costs will continue, and could increase, while the war in Ukraine persists.\nIn addition, our ability to provide services in Ukraine may be impaired if we are unable to maintain key personnel within\nUkraine, or our infrastructure within Ukraine is significantly damaged, destroyed or occupied. As of December 31, 2023 and June\n30, 2024, we have experienced partial destruction of our infrastructure in Ukraine (about 11.3 and 11.1%, respectively, of our\n80\ntelecommunication network has been damaged or destroyed, of which about 41.6% and 40.1%, respectively, has been restored).\nAs of June 30, 2024 approximately 5.7% of our telecommunication network is currently not functional and located in the Russian-\noccupied territories. While we have thus far managed to repair most of our network assets that incurred damage in Ukrainian\nterritory that is not under Russian occupation, as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine there can be no\nassurance that our Ukrainian network will not sustain additional major damage and that such damage can be repaired in a timely\nmanner as the war continues. In addition, with increased targeting of Ukraine’s electrical grid, we have faced challenges ensuring\nthat our network assets in Ukraine have a power source. We have installed additional generators and batteries, 2,191 power\nconversion systems and 121,188 power conversion systems, respectively, to ensure 72-hour energy backup capacity in order to\nmeet certain regulatory requirements. Furthermore, we have developed and, in some cases, implemented additional contingency\nplans to relocate work and/or personnel to other geographies and add new locations, as appropriate. Our business continuity\nplans are designed to address known contingency scenarios to ensure that we have adequate processes and practices in place\nto protect the safety of our people and to handle potential impacts to our operations. Our crisis management procedures,\nbusiness continuity plans, and disaster recovery capabilities may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of\nprolonged or multiple crises, such as civil unrest, military conflict or a pandemic in a concentrated geographic area. In December\n2023, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Kyivstar, was the target of a widespread cyber-attack that caused technical failure\nresulting in Kyivstar subscribers being unable to use its communication services. As part of our crisis management procedures\nand business continuity plans, we worked closely with Ukrainian law enforcement agencies to determine the cause of the\nattacks; the assessments conducted indicate that Kyivstar likely experienced these attacks as a part of the ongoing war in\nUkraine. See “We have experienced and are continually exposed to cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity threats, both to our\nown operations or those of our third party providers, that may lead to compromised or inaccessible telecommunications, digital\nand financial services and/or leaks or unauthorized processing of confidential information, and perceptions of such threats may\ncause customers to lose confidence in our services” for more information.\nThe current events in the regions where we operate in Ukraine and where we derive a significant amount of our\nbusiness may pose security risks to our people, our facilities, our operations and infrastructure, such as utilities and network\nservices, and the disruption of any or all of them could significantly affect our business, financial conditions and results of\noperations, and cause volatility in the price of our securities.\nIndirect Impact of the War\nAs a leading telecommunications provider in Ukraine, we have been adversely impacted by the ongoing war. We expect\nto continue to face challenges with our performance in Ukraine, which may be exacerbated as the war continues. Furthermore, if\nthere is an extended continuation or further increase in the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, it could result in further\ninstability and/or worsening of the overall political and economic situation in Ukraine, Europe and/or in the global economy and\ncapital markets generally. These are highly uncertain times, and it is not possible to predict with precision how certain\ndevelopments will indirectly impact our business and results of operations, nor is it possible to execute comprehensive\ncontingency planning in Ukraine due to the ongoing war and inherent danger in the country. The discussion below attempts to\nsurmise how prolongation or escalation of the war, expansion of current sanctions, the imposition of new and broader sanctions,\nand disruptions in our operations, transactions with key suppliers and counterparties could have an indirect impact on our results\nand operations. We cannot assure you that risks related to the war are limited to those described in this Annual Report 2023.\nOn February 24, 2022, Ukraine declared martial law and introduced measures in response to the ongoing war with\nRussia, which include local banking and capital restrictions that prohibit our Ukrainian subsidiary from making any interest or\ndividend payments to us, and introduced legal restrictions on making almost any payments abroad, including making payments\nto foreign suppliers (with a small number of exceptions expressly provided by law, or on the basis of separate government\napprovals). Currently, it is not possible to predict how long the martial law in Ukraine will last and accordingly how long the above\nrestrictions will last and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any separate government approvals for foreign\npayments, meaning our ability to make interest or dividend payments from our Ukrainian operations could be restricted for some\ntime.\nIn October 2022, Ukraine imposed sanctions for a ten-year period against Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and Andriy\nKosogov, who are some of our beneficial owners due to their ownership in LetterOne. These sanctions apply exclusively to the\nsanctioned individuals and do not have a direct impact on VEON as these individuals are not part of the Company’s corporate\ngovernance mechanisms nor are they able to exercise any rights regarding VEON. However, we cannot rule out the potential\nimpact of these sanctions on banks’ and other parties’ readiness to transfer dividends in the event the above restrictions are\nlifted, or the nationalization risk such measures pose to Kyivstar. Furthermore, the government of Russia has introduced\ncountermeasure sanctions which have subjected or could subject our legal entities and employees in Ukraine to restrictions or\nliabilities, including capital controls, international funds transfer restrictions, asset freezes, nationalization measures or other\nrestrictive measures. See “—Investing in emerging markets, where our operations are located, is subject to greater risks than\ninvesting in more developed markets, including significant political, legal and economic risks” for a discussion on the introduction\nof nationalization laws in Ukraine.\nFurthermore, while we have not been named as, and have concluded that we are otherwise not, the target of United\nStates, European Union or United Kingdom sanctions as a consequence of LetterOne being a 45.5% shareholder in VEON (as\nof September 30, 2024) (which has certain ultimate beneficial owners which are subject to sanctions), it cannot be ruled out that\nVEON or LetterOne could become the target of future sanctions or that certain other beneficial owners of LetterOne may be\nsanctioned in the future, which could materially adversely affect our operations, access to capital and the price of our securities.\nEven with the sale of our Russian operating company PJSC VimpelCom and its subsidiaries (collectively, our “Russian\n81\nOperations”), the sanctions against certain of our beneficial owners have continued to pose challenges to our business and\noperations. For example, we have faced challenges and expect we will continue to face challenges in conducting business with\npersons or entities subject to the jurisdiction of the relevant sanctions regimes, including international financial institutions, rating\nagencies, independent auditor and international equipment suppliers, which can impact our ability to raise funds from\ninternational capital markets, acquire equipment from international suppliers or access assets held abroad. In addition, we may\nface increased challenges with appointing international financial institutions as a result of the issuance of Executive Order 14114\nin December 2023, which amended Executive Order 14024, to authorize the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions\non non-US financial institutions in the event it determines such institutions have conducted or facilitated any significant\ntransaction or transactions, or provided any service, involving companies operating in Russia’s technology sector among others\nsectors. While we do not believe the nature of any remaining ties that we have with VimpelCom, including our Beeline license,\nwould fall within the scope of such sanctions, international financial institutions could take the position that VimpelCom operates\nin Russia’s technology sector and therefore decline to process any transactions that we have involving VimpelCom. Financial\ninstitutions may also reexamine their relationships with VEON given our prior nexus to VimpelCom. Moreover, if we become the\ntarget of US, EU or UK sanctions, investors subject to the jurisdiction of an applicable sanctions regime may become restricted in\ntheir ability to sell, transfer or otherwise deal in or receive payments with respect to our securities. For more information, see “—\nViolations of and changes to applicable sanctions and embargo laws, including export control restrictions, may harm our\nbusiness”.\nIn addition, certain of our key infrastructure and assets located within Ukraine may be seized or may be subject to\nappropriation if Russian forces obtain control of the regions within Ukraine where those assets are situated and, therefore, may\nhave an adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate in Ukraine. In May 2023, pursuant to existing Ukrainian\nnationalization laws (the “Nationalization Laws”), the President of Ukraine signed an initial package of restrictive measures\nrelating to 41 entities, including against Zaporizhstal, one of Ukraine’s largest metallurgical companies, due to Russian\nownership in the company’s structure. Furthermore, as part of the measures adopted by Ukraine in response to the ongoing war\nwith Russia, amendments to the Nationalization Laws have been approved by the Ukrainian Parliament and, as of June 30,\n2024, are awaiting signing by the President of Ukraine (the “Nationalization Laws Amendments”). Among other things, the\nNationalization Laws Amendments extend the definition of “residents” whose property in Ukraine (whether owned directly or\nindirectly) can be seized under the Nationalization Laws to include property owned by the Russian state, Russian citizens, other\nnationals with a close relationships to Russia, residing or having a main place of business in Russia, or legal entities operating in\nUkraine whose founder or ultimate beneficial owner is the Russian state or are controlled or managed by any of the individuals\nidentified above. It is currently unclear when the President of Ukraine will sign the Nationalization Laws Amendments into law, if\nat all.\nFurther, in April 2023, the Ukrainian Parliament approved measures to allow for the nationalization of Sense Bank\n(previously known as Alfa Bank), one of Ukraine’s largest commercial banks, on the basis that Sense Bank is a systemically\nimportant bank in Ukraine and it had shareholders that were sanctioned by Ukraine, including Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven,\nwho are shareholders in LetterOne.\nIn November 2022, the Ukrainian government invoked martial law, which allows the Ukrainian government to take\ncontrol of stakes in strategic companies in Ukraine in order to meet the needs of the defense sector. In February 2024, the\nUkrainian government announced the extension of the martial law period to May 14, 2024. In May 2024, the Ukrainian\ngovernment announced an extension of the period from May 14, 2024 to August 11, 2024. The Ukraine Security Council\nSecretary indicated that, at the end of the application of martial law, assets which the Ukrainian government has taken control of\npursuant to the martial law can be returned to their owners or such owners may be appropriately compensated.\nOn October 6, 2023, the Security Services of Ukraine (SSU) announced that the Ukrainian courts froze all “corporate\nrights” of Mikhail Fridman in 20 Ukrainian companies in which he holds a beneficial interest, while criminal proceedings initiated\nin Ukraine against Mikhail Fridman and which are unrelated to VEON or any of our subsidiaries are in progress. We have\nreceived notification from our local custodian that the following percentages of the corporate rights in our Ukrainian subsidiaries\nhave been frozen: (i) 47.85% of Kyivstar, (ii) 100% of Ukraine Tower Company, (iii) 100% of Kyivstar.Tech, and (iv) 69.99% of\nHelsi Ukraine. The freezing of these corporate rights prevents any transactions involving our shares in such subsidiaries from\nproceeding. On October 30, 2023, we announced that two appeals were filed with the relevant Kyiv courts, challenging the\nfreezing of the corporate rights in Kyivstar and Ukraine Tower Company and requesting the lifting of the freezing of our corporate\nrights. In December 2023, the court rejected the appeals. On June 4, 2024, the CEO of VEON, in his capacity as a shareholder\nof VEON, filed a motion with Shevchenkivskiy District Court of Kyiv requesting cancellation of the freezing of corporate rights in\nUkraine Tower Company. On June 26, 2024, the motion was supplemented to request cancellation of the freezing of corporate\nrights in our other Ukrainian subsidiaries: Kyivstar, Kyivstar.Tech and Helsi Ukraine. Such action remains pending.\nFurthermore, in April 2024, draft amendments to the Law of Ukraine “On Sanctions” of August 14, 2014 were introduced\nin the Ukrainian Parliament (the “Sanctions Law Amendments”), which could be applicable to our subsidiaries in Ukraine. Under\nthe proposed Sanctions Law Amendments, the Ukrainian government may petition the relevant Ukrainian court to confiscate\n100% of the corporate rights in any Ukrainian company if a person sanctioned by Ukraine, directly or indirectly holds a stake in\nsuch company, regardless of the percentage of the stake or the manner in which it is held. Following such confiscation, shares in\nsuch companies that are attributable to non-sanctioned persons would be held in escrow and would eventually be redistributed to\nsuch non-sanctioned persons upon application for redistribution. The voting and dividend rights of non-sanctioned persons would\nbe suspended from the moment the shares are placed into escrow until redistribution. If non-sanctioned persons fail to apply for\nformalization of their ownership within five years from the confiscation, their shares would be transferred to the state of Ukraine\nwithout compensation. In August 2024, the Sanctions Law Amendments were withdrawn but the possibility cannot be excluded\nthat similar proposals may be introduced in the Ukrainian Parliament at a later date.\n82\nFinally, according to press reports, on September 25, 2024, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine filed a suit with the Ukraine High\nAnti-Corruption Court seeking confiscation of the shares in various companies related to Mikkail Fridman, Petr Aven and Adriy\nKosogov and the company Rissa Investments Limited, in which certain of these individuals hold an interest. None of the shares\nreported to be targeted by such action are related to VEON or any of our subsidiaries.\nIt is possible that the Ukrainian authorities may continue to propose or implement further measures, including sanctions targeting\ncompanies that have Russian shareholders, and any such measures or similar measures, if applied in relation to our Ukrainian\nsubsidiaries, could lead to the involuntary deconsolidation of our Ukrainian subsidiaries, a loss in our assets and/or significant\ndisruption to our operations, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report 2023 have been prepared on a going concern\nbasis as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report 2023 have been prepared on a going concern\nbasis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and\ncommitments in the normal course of business. Due to the unknown duration and extent of the ongoing war between Russia and\nUkraine and the uncertainty of further sanctions in response to the ongoing war that may be imposed, there are material\nuncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern. These\nmaterial uncertainties relate to our ability to maintain our financial and non-financial debt covenants and positive equity levels,\npotential new sanctions and export controls imposed by the United States, European Union, and the United Kingdom that could\nfurther impact our liquidity position and ability to attract new financing or our ability to source relevant network equipment from\nvendors as well as VEON’s financial performance as a whole, as a result management has concluded that there is substantial\ndoubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months after the date that the consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Annual Report 2023 have been issued. Although we have taken a number of measures to protect our\nliquidity and cash provisions, given the uncertainty and exogenous nature of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and\npotential for further sanctions and counter-sanctions, and future imposition of external administration over our Ukrainian\noperations in particular, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these initiatives or that the\ncontingencies outside of our control will not materialize. See Note 23—Basis of Preparation of the Consolidated Financial\nStatements to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nFrom time to time, we recognize impairment charges in respect of our CGUs, some of which can be substantial,\nincluding the potential impairment charge for our Bangladesh CGU following recent political unrest\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, substantial impairment charges as a result of significant differences\nbetween the actual performance of our operating companies and the forecasted projection for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and/or\ncapital expenditure which could require us to write-down the value of our non-current assets, including property and equipment\nand intangible assets (e.g., goodwill). The possible consequences of a financial, economic or geopolitical crises, including the\nongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and political uncertainty in Bangladesh, and the impact such crises may have on\ncustomer behavior, the reactions of our competitors in terms of offers and pricing or their responses to new entrants in the\nmarket, regulatory adjustments in relation to changes in consumer prices and our ability to adjust costs and investments in\nresponse to changes in revenue, may also adversely affect our forecasts and lead to a write-down of tangible and intangible\nassets, including goodwill. In addition, significant adverse developments in our share price, and the resulting decrease in our\nmarket capitalization may also lead to a write-down of our goodwill balances. A write-down recorded for tangible and intangible\nassets resulting in a lowering of their book values could impact certain covenants and provisions under our debt agreements,\nwhich could result in a deterioration of our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, significant adverse\ndevelopments in our share price, and the resulting decrease in our market capitalization may also lead to a write-down of our\ngoodwill balances. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024 our consolidated balance sheet had US$349 million and\nUS$345 million, respectively, in goodwill.\nWe regularly test our property and equipment and intangible assets for impairment by calculating the fair value less cost\nof disposal (“FVLCD”) for our cash generating units (“CGU”) to determine whether any adjustments to the carrying value of\nCGUs are required. Our assessment of the FVLCD of our CGUs involves estimations about the future performance of the CGU,\naccordingly, our estimate can be quite sensitive to significant assumptions of projected discount rates, EBITDA growth, projected\ncapital expenditures, long term revenue growth rate and related terminal values. The Company assesses, at the end of each\nreporting period, whether there exists any indicators (“triggers”) that indicate an asset may be impaired (e.g, asset becoming idle,\ndamaged or no longer in use). If there are such indicators, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually (at September 30) or when circumstances indicate the carrying value may be\nimpaired. During 2023, we reported US$1 million (US$36 million in 2022) in impairment charges with respect to assets in\nUkraine, which included impairments to property and equipment as a result of physical damages to sites in Ukraine caused by\nthe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. We determined there were no other impairments for the year ended December\n31, 2023.\nDuring July and August 2024 there was increased political uncertainty in Bangladesh culminating in network outages\nand blockages experienced by our Bangladesh subsidiary in connection with mass protests, civil unrest and riots that resulted in\nthe fall of the government of Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina and the establishment of an interim government. These events and\nthe political unrest have negatively impacted the populations’ disposable income and influenced telecom spending patterns, while\nincreased operation costs for the business unit identified indicators of an impairment event with respect to our Bangladesh CGU\nin the third quarter of 2024. Management has not yet finalized the quantitative and qualitative assessments and valuation tests\n83\nrequired to determine the estimated financial impact of such triggers in Bangladesh during the third quarter of 2024. Preliminary\nanalysis suggests that we may incur a substantial impairment charge to the carrying value of the Bangladesh CGU for the period\nended September 30, 2024. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 20-F, we do not have enough certainty to provide an\nestimate of the charge or range of potential outcomes, but initial results of quantitative and qualitative assessments and valuation\ntests indicate that an impairment charge is likely to be material. We, however, cannot rule out the possibility that the final results\nof our impairment analysis may deviate significantly from our preliminary assessment. Final results of the analysis are expected\nto be published in our interim unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024.\nFollowing the annual impairment goodwill test as at September 30, 2023 and the subsequent triggering event analysis as at\nDecember 31, 2023, no impairments were found at our Bangladesh CGU as, amongst other factors, it was operating in a\nrevenue growth period (which period lasted through our second quarter of 2024), however, the Bangladesh CGU did have limited\nheadroom in its carrying value; as a result, the impairment charge is expected to have a direct impact on our operating profit.\nSee Note 11—Impairment of Assets and Note 13—Intangible Assets to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther detail. The circumstances in Bangladesh could also impact our assessment relating to the recognition and recoverability\nof our deferred tax assets in Bangladesh. See “Changes in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations, including our determination\nof the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets, could harm our business, and the unpredictable tax systems and our\nperformance in the markets in which we operate give rise to significant uncertainties and risks that could complicate our tax and\nbusiness decisions” for more information.\nFor further information on the impairment of tangible and intangible assets and recoverable amounts (particularly key\nassumptions and sensitivities), see Note 10—Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, Note 11—Impairment of Assets and\nNote 13—Intangible Assets to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of the risks associated with the\nmarkets where we operate, see —The international economic environment, inflationary pressures, geopolitical developments\nand unexpected global events could cause our business to decline, —Investing in emerging markets, where our operations are\nlocated, is subject to greater risks than investing in more developed markets, including significant political, legal and economic\nrisks and —The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is having, and will continue to have, an impact on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe have suffered reputational harm as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed.\nOn February 28, 2022, the European Union imposed sanctions on Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven; on March 15, 2022,\nthe United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the LetterOne shareholders, Mr. Fridman, Mr. Aven, Alexey Kuzmichev and German\nKhan, and the European Union additionally designated Mr. Khan and Mr. Kuzmichev; and on August 11, 2023, the United States\ndesignated Mr. Fridman, Mr. Aven, Mr. Khan, and Mr. Kuzmichev (collectively, the “Designated Persons”). Mr. Fridman resigned\nfrom VEON’s board of directors effective February 28, 2022. None of the other Designated Persons were members of the Board\nof Directors. We understand, based on a letter provided by LetterOne, a 45.5% shareholder in VEON, that Mr. Fridman and Mr.\nAven are shareholders in LetterOne (approximately 37.86% and 12.13%, respectively) and that Mr. Khan and Mr. Kuzmichev are\nno longer shareholders in LetterOne. In October 2022, Ukraine imposed sanctions for a ten-year period against Mikhail Fridman\nand Petr Aven, as well as Andriy Kosogov, who is also a shareholder in LetterOne (holding approximately 47.24% of LetterOne’s\nshares based on a LetterOne memorandum dated May 24, 2022 and updated February 28, 2023) (Andriy Kosogov, along with\nthe Designated Persons, the “Sanctioned Persons”). On October 6, 2023, the Security Services of Ukraine (“SSU”) announced\nthat the Ukrainian courts are seizing all “corporate rights” of Mr. Fridman in 20 Ukrainian companies that he beneficially owns,\nwhile criminal proceedings, unrelated to Kyivstar or VEON, are in progress. This announcement was incorrectly characterized by\nsome Ukrainian media as a “seizure” or “freezing” of “Kyivstar’s assets”. On October 9, 2023, Ukrainian media further reported,\nwith a headline which incorrectly references Kyivstar, that the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine is separately finalizing a lawsuit in the\nUkraine High Anti-Corruption Court to confiscate any Ukrainian assets of Mikhail Fridman. We have received notification from our\nlocal custodian that 47.85% of Kyivstar shares have been blocked, which will prevent any transaction involving our shares from\nproceeding. On October 30, 2023 VEON announced that VEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings B.V. have filed two motions with the\nrelevant Kyiv court of appeals, challenging the freezing of the corporate rights in Kyivstar, noting that corporate rights in Kyivstar\nbelong exclusively to VEON, and that their full or partial seizure directly violates the rights of VEON and its international debt and\nequity investors, and requesting the lifting of the freezing of its corporate rights in Kyivstar. In December 2023, the court rejected\nthe Company’s appeals. On June 4, 2024, the CEO of VEON, in his capacity as a shareholder of VEON, filed a motion with\nShevchenkiv District Court of Kyiv requesting cancellation of the seizure of corporate rights in the VEON group's subsidiary\nUkraine Tower Company. On June 26, 2024, the motion was supplemented to request cancellation of the seizure of corporate\nrights in the VEON group's other Ukrainian subsidiaries: Kyivstar, Kyivstar.Tech and Helsi. VEON is continuing significant\ngovernment affairs efforts alongside these court actions, however, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be\nsuccessful. Restrictions applicable in Ukraine to all foreign-owned companies have already led to restrictions on the upstreaming\nof dividends from Ukraine to VEON, prohibitions on renting state property and land and prohibitions on participation in public\nprocurement impacting B2G revenue. Additionally, to the extent that VEON and/or Kyivstar are deemed to be controlled by\npersons sanctioned in Ukraine, potential prohibitions on the transfer of technology and intellectual property rights to Kyivstar from\nVEON would also apply. For further information on the freezing of VEON’s corporate rights in Kyivstar and the legal actions the\nCompany is taking to challenge the freeze, see Note 1— General Information about the Group—Freezing of corporate rights in\nKyivstar.\nWe have not been named as, and have concluded that we are otherwise not, the target of the United States’, United Kingdom’s,\nthe European Union’s or Ukraine’s sanctions, including as a consequence of LetterOne being a 45.5% shareholder in VEON.\n84\nHowever, as a result of the association of Sanctioned Persons with our largest shareholder, even after the sale of our Russian\nOperations, we have suffered and may continue to suffer reputational harm. Moreover, notwithstanding this sale, many\nmultinational companies and firms, including certain of our service providers, partners and suppliers, have chosen of their own\naccord to cease transacting with us along with all Russia-based or Russian-affiliated companies or those that they perceive to be\naffiliated with Russia (i.e. self-imposed sanctions), as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. To the extent that\nthe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine continues or further escalates, the list of companies and firms refusing to transact\nwith companies they determine or perceive to be Russian or Russian-affiliated, including as a result of ultimate beneficial\nowners, may continue to grow.\nSuch actions have the equivalent effect, insofar as the ability to transact with such companies is concerned, as if the\ncompanies that are perceived to be Russia-based or Russian-affiliated companies were the target of government-imposed\nsanctions. In the event the association of our largest shareholder continues to have an impact on certain of our operations, the\ninability or reduction in business with our key suppliers, business partners and other key counterparties could have a material\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects and price of our securities.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange loss, fluctuation and translation risks, including as a result of the ongoing war\nbetween Russia and Ukraine.\nA significant amount of our costs, expenditures and liabilities, including capital expenditures and borrowings, is\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, while our operating revenue is denominated in Ukrainian hryvnia, Pakistani rupee, Kazakhstani\ntenge, Bangladeshi taka and Uzbekistani som and other local currencies. In general, declining values of these and other local\ncurrencies against the U.S. dollar make it more difficult for us to repay or refinance our debt, make dividend payments, comply\nwith covenants under our debt agreements or purchase equipment or services denominated in U.S. dollars, and may impact our\nability to exchange cash reserves in one currency for use in another jurisdiction for capital expenditures, operating costs and\ndebt servicing. Furthermore, following the completion of the sale of our Russian Operations, we have retained some of our\nRussian ruble denominated debt, even though we no longer generate revenue in Russian rubles. Currently the international\nclearing systems have stopped payments in Russian ruble which prevents the repayment of our Russian ruble denominated\nnotes in Russian ruble, as a result of which we will be subject to currency fluctuations when repaying or refinancing our debt and\ndeclining values of the local currencies in which we generate revenue against the Russian ruble will also pose risk similar to\nthose we face in relation to our U.S. dollar denominated costs, expenditures and liabilities. See —Operational Risks—As a\nholding company with a number of operating subsidiaries, we depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to\npay dividends or make other transfers to VEON Ltd., as well as the ability to make certain intercompany payments and transfers\nand —Liquidity and Capital Risks—Our substantial amounts of indebtedness and debt service obligations could materially\ndecrease our cash flow, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Our operating metrics, debt coverage\nmetrics and the value of some of our investments in U.S. dollar terms have been negatively impacted in recent years, and will be\nnegatively impacted in the current period by foreign currency transactions and translations. More broadly, future currency\nfluctuations and volatility may result in losses or otherwise negatively impact our results of operations despite our efforts to better\nalign the currency mix of our debt and derivatives with the currencies of our operations.\nWe primarily generate revenue in currencies which have historically experienced greater volatility than the U.S. dollar. As a\nresult, we may be exposed to greater foreign currency exchange losses, fluctuations and translation risks than in prior years\nwhen we primarily generated revenue in both Russian ruble and U.S. dollar. The value of the Ukrainian hryvnia experienced\nsignificant volatility following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which resulted in the National Bank of Ukraine\nfixing the Ukrainian hryvnia to a set rate of 29.25 to the U.S. dollar in February 2022. In July 2022, the National Bank of Ukraine\ndevalued the Ukrainian hryvnia to a set rate of 36.57 to the U.S. dollar, representing a devaluation of 25%, which it later removed\nin October 2023, replacing it with a more flexible exchange rate. The National Bank of Ukraine will continue to significantly limit\nexchange-rate fluctuations, preventing both a significant weakening and a significant strengthening of the Ukrainian hryvnia and\nwe cannot be certain that the Ukrainian hryvnia will be pegged to the U.S. dollar at a later date. Because of the effects of the\nongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, Ukraine’s economy is expected to continue to contract, which could further impact the\nUkrainian hryvnia to U.S. dollar rate. Any change to the Ukrainian hryvnia/U.S. dollar exchange rate could cause the Group’s\nresults of operations and financial condition to fluctuate due to currency translation effects. When the Ukrainian hryvnia\ndepreciates against the U.S. dollar in a given period, the results of our Ukrainian business expressed in U.S. dollars will be lower\nperiod-on-period, even assuming consistent Ukrainian hryvnia revenue across the periods. Furthermore, we could be materially\nadversely impacted by a further decline in the value of the Ukrainian hryvnia against the U.S. dollar due to the decline of the\ngeneral economic performance of Ukraine (including as a result of the continued impact of the war with Russia), investment in\nUkraine or trade with Ukrainian companies decreasing substantially, the Ukrainian government experiencing difficulty raising\nmoney through the issuance of debt in the global capital markets or as a result of a technical or actual default on Ukrainian\nsovereign debt. Depreciation of the Ukrainian hryvnia could be sustained over a long period of time due to rising inflation levels in\nUkraine as well. However, it may be possible that such depreciation is not reflected in any rate that could be set by the National\nBank of Ukraine due to its efforts to control inflation. Although such changes could have a positive impact on our local currency\nresults in Ukraine, such gains could be offset by a corresponding depreciation of the Ukrainian hryvnia in U.S. dollar terms. In\naddition, a significant depreciation of the Ukrainian hryvnia could also negatively affect our leverage ratio and equity balances,\nwhich would have an impact on certain covenants and provisions under our debt agreements. See —Liquidity and Capital Risks\n—Our substantial amounts of indebtedness and debt service obligations could materially decrease our cash flow, which could\nadversely affect our business and financial condition for a further discussion on this risk.\n85\nIn addition to the Ukrainian hryvnia, the values of the Pakistani rupee, Kazakhstani tenge, Kyrgyzstani som and\nUzbekistani som have experienced significant volatility in recent years in response to certain political and economic issues,\nincluding the recent global inflationary pressure, and such volatility may continue and result in depreciation of these currencies\nagainst the U.S. dollar. We have also seen the currencies of the countries in which we operate experience periods of high levels\nof inflation from high state budget expenditures, the global rise in prices for goods, increased political instability, climate and war-\nrelated impacts, and energy grid shortages which all resulted in high inflation rates in 2023 and continued in 2024. While in 2023\ninflation levels began to decrease in some of our markets of operation, it is still relatively high compared to previous years, and\nany increase in inflation or sustained period of high inflation in any of our markets of operation could have a significant impact on\nour loan portfolio as a result of the impact that inflation can have on the exchange rate of the local currencies of our operations.\nInflationary pressures can exacerbate the risks associated with currency fluctuation with respect to a given country. Our profit\nmargins in countries experiencing high inflation could be harmed if we are unable to sufficiently increase our prices to offset any\nsignificant future increase in the inflation rate, manifested in inflationary increases in salary, wages, benefits and other\nadministrative, supply and energy costs, and such price increases may be difficult with our mass market and price-sensitive\ncustomer base.\nTo counteract the effects of the aforementioned risks, we engage in certain hedging strategies. However, our hedging\nstrategies may prove ineffective if, for example, exchange rates fluctuate in response to legislative or regulatory action by a\ngovernment with respect to its currency. For more information about our foreign currency translation and associated risks, see\nNote —Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Factors Affecting Comparability and Results of Operations, Note —\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note 18—Financial Risk Management to our Audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nThe international economic environment, inflationary pressures, geopolitical developments and unexpected global events could\ncause our business to decline.\nAs a global telecommunications company operating in a number of emerging markets, our operations are subject to\nmacroeconomic risks, geopolitical developments and unexpected global events that are outside of our control. Unfavorable\neconomic conditions in the markets in which we operate may have a direct negative impact on the financial condition of our\ncustomers, which in turn will affect a significant number of our current and potential customers’ spending patterns, in terms of\nboth the products and services they subscribe for and usage levels. During such downturns, it may be more difficult for us to\ngrow our business, either by attracting new customers or by increasing usage levels among existing customers, and it may be\nmore likely that customers will downgrade or disconnect their services, making it more difficult for us to maintain ARPUs and\nsubscriber numbers at existing levels. In addition to the potential impact on revenue, ARPUs, cash flow and liquidity, such\neconomic downturns may also impact our ability to decrease our costs, execute our strategies, take advantage of future\nopportunities, respond to competitive pressures, refinance existing indebtedness or meet unexpected financial requirements.\nAdverse global developments such as wars, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, pandemics and the ongoing war\nbetween Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas and the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran has impacted and could\ncontinue to impact the global economy for the foreseeable future, and the conflicts with Israel are threatening to spread, and may in the future\nspread, into other Middle Eastern countries. These adverse global developments and any spread or intensification of the forementioned\nconflicts could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects directly or\nindirectly. For example, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, and the effect of such developments on the Ukrainian\neconomy (and other economies that are closely tied to the Russian or Ukrainian economies), affected our results of operations\nand financial condition in 2022, 2023 and in the first half of 2024, and will likely continue to affect our operations and financial\ncondition for the remainder of 2024 and the foreseeable future. In addition, the increasing price of fossil fuels and uncertainty\nregarding inflation rates are expected to have broader adverse effects on many of the economies in which we operate and may\nresult in recessionary periods and lower corporate investment, which, in turn, could lead to economic strain on our business and\non current and potential customers. Outside of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, we are exposed to other\ngeopolitical and diplomatic developments that involve the countries in which we operate, such as the current political uncertainty\nin Pakistan which has persisted since the no-confidence vote in April 2022 and the recent anti-government protests in\nBangladesh during which our subsidiary experienced network outages and blockages that disrupted our operations. We are also\nimpacted by other geopolitical and diplomatic developments in countries in which we do not operate as such developments may\nhave a knock-on effect on our business. For example, heightened tensions between the major economies of the world, such as\nthe United States and China, can have an adverse effect to the economies in which we operate, and therefore an adverse impact\non our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.\nOur financial performance has been and may also continue to be affected by macroeconomic issues more broadly,\nincluding risks of inflation, deflation, stagflation, recessions, sovereign debt levels and the stability of currencies across our key\nmarkets and globally. In particular, global economic markets ‎have seen extensive volatility over the past few years owing to the\noutbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the war ‎between Russia and Ukraine, and the war between Israel and Hamas, the\nescalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, the closing of certain financial institutions by ‎regulators from March 2023, and\npolitical instability. These events have created, and may continue to create, ‎significant disruption of the global economy, supply\nchains and distribution channels, and financial and labor ‎markets. If such conditions continue, recur or worsen, this may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on customer demand, the Company’s ‎business, financial condition and results of operations and its ability\nto access capital on ‎favorable terms, or at all, and we could be negatively impacted as a result of such conditions and\nconsequences. ‎Furthermore, such economic conditions have produced downward pressure on share prices and on the\navailability ‎of credit for financial institutions and corporations while also driving up interest rates, further complicating ‎borrowing\nand lending activities. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or increase, the ‎Company might continue to\nexperience reductions in business activity, increases in funding costs, decreases in asset values, ‎additional write-downs and\nimpairment charges and lower profitability. In addition, rising energy costs, as a result of, among other things, the ongoing war\n86\nbetween Russia and Ukraine, has resulted in many countries across the world experiencing high levels of inflation and lower\ncorporate profits, causing increased uncertainty about the near-term macroeconomic outlook as central bank interest rates are\nbeing raised to combat the high inflation. The war between Russia and Ukraine has adversely impacted, and may continue to\nadversely impact, our customer numbers in Ukraine, and the war and these other pressures could negatively impact customers’\ndiscretionary spending, which could, in turn, affect our revenue, ARPU, cash flow and liquidity or our customers’ ability to pay for\nour services.\nInvesting in emerging markets, where our operations are located, is subject to greater risks than investing in more developed\nmarkets, including significant political, legal and economic risks.\nOur operations are located in the world’s emerging markets. Investors should fully appreciate the significance of the\nrisks involved in investing in an emerging markets company and are urged to consult with their own legal, financial and tax\nadvisors. Emerging market governments and judiciaries often exercise broad discretion and are susceptible to the rapid reversal\nof political and economic policies. Furthermore, we operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential\nviolations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws, based on measurements such as\nTransparency International’s Corruption Perception Index. The political and economic relations of our countries of operation are\noften complex and have resulted, and may in the future result, in wars, which could materially harm our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. The outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine is an illustration of\nthis.\nThe economies of emerging markets are also vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns in the global\neconomy. As has happened in the past, a slowdown in the global economy or an increase in the perceived risks associated with\ninvesting in emerging economies could dampen foreign investment in these markets and materially adversely affect their\neconomies. In addition, turnover of political leaders or parties in emerging markets as a result of a scheduled election upon the\nend of a term of service or in other circumstances may also affect the legal and regulatory regime in those markets to a greater\nextent than turnover in developed countries. Any of these developments could severely limit our access to capital and could\nmaterially harm the purchasing power of our customers and, consequently, our business. Such events could also create\nuncertain regulatory environments, which, in turn, could impact our compliance with license obligations and other regulatory\napprovals. The nature of much of the legislation in emerging markets, the lack of consensus about the scope, content and pace\nof economic and political reform and the rapid evolution of the legal and regulatory systems in emerging markets place the\nenforceability and, possibly, the constitutionality of laws and regulations in doubt and result in ambiguities, inconsistencies and\nanomalies. The legislation often contemplates implementing regulations that have not yet been promulgated, leaving substantial\ngaps in the regulatory infrastructure. Any of these factors could affect our ability to enforce our rights under our licenses or our\ncontracts, or to defend our company against claims by other parties. See —Regulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks—The\ntelecommunications industry is a highly regulated industry and we are subject to an extensive variety of laws and operate in\nuncertain judicial and regulatory environments, which may result in unanticipated outcomes that could harm our business for a\nmore detailed discussion on our regulatory environment.\nMany of the emerging markets in which we operate are susceptible to experiencing significant social unrest or military\nconflicts. Our ability to provide service in Ukraine following the onset of the war with Russia has been impacted due to power\noutages and damage to our infrastructure. Similarly, our subsidiary in Pakistan has also been ordered to shut down parts of its\nmobile network and services from time to time due to the security or political situation in the country (including a four-day blanket\ndata closure in 2023 during the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan). More recently, in July and August 2024, our\nsubsidiary in Bangladesh experienced network outages and blockages during weeks of anti-government protests that toppled\nlong-serving Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina, and the subsequent establishment of an interim government in Bangladesh. To a\nlesser degree, we continue to be impacted in Bangladesh and Pakistan by severe flooding in the region in 2023 and 2024. Local\nauthorities may also order our subsidiaries to temporarily shut down part or all of our networks due to actions relating to military\nconflicts or nationwide strikes. See Market Risks —The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is having, and will continue to\nhave, an impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects for a detailed discussion on\nthe impact that the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has had and could have on our business.\nFurthermore, governments or other factions, including those asserting authority over specific territories in areas of war,\ncould make inappropriate use of our networks, attempt to compel us to operate our network in war zones or disputed territories\nand/or force us to broadcast propaganda or illegal instructions to our customers or others (and threaten consequences for failure\nto do so). Forced shutdowns or broadcasts, inappropriate use of our network or being compelled to operate our network in war\nzones could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. The spread of\nviolence, or its intensification, could have significant political consequences, including the imposition of a state of emergency,\nwhich could materially adversely affect the investment environment in the countries in which we operate. Social instability in the\ncountries in which we operate, coupled with difficult economic conditions, could lead to increased support for centralized\nauthority, a rise in nationalism and potential nationalizations or expropriations by governments. These sentiments and adverse\neconomic conditions could lead to restrictions on foreign ownership of companies in the telecommunications industry or\nnationalization, expropriation or other seizure of certain assets or businesses. In most of the countries in which we operate, there\nis relatively little experience in enforcing legislation enacted to protect private property against nationalization or expropriation. As\na result, we may not be able to obtain proper redress in the courts, have and may continue to be required to expend resources to\nseek redress for such measures, and we may not receive adequate compensation if in the future the governments decide to\nnationalize or expropriate some or all of our assets. In addition, ethnic, religious, historical and other divisions have, on occasion,\ngiven rise to tensions and, in certain cases, military war.\n87\nOur revenue performance can be unpredictable by nature, as a large majority of our customers have not entered into long-term\nfixed contracts with us.\nOur primary source of revenue comes from prepaid mobile customers, who are not required to enter into long-term fixed\ncontracts, and we cannot be certain that these customers will continue to use our services and at the usage levels we expect.\nRevenue from postpaid mobile customers represents a small percentage of our total operating revenue and such customers can\ncancel our postpaid contracts with limited advance notice and without significant penalty. For example, as of December 31, 2023,\napproximately 97% and 80% of our customers in Pakistan and Ukraine respectively and as of June 30, 2024 approximately 98%\nand 78% of our customers in Pakistan and Ukraine respectively were on prepaid plans. Furthermore, as we incur costs based on\nour expectations of future revenue, the sudden loss of a large number of customers or a failure to accurately predict revenue in a\ngiven market could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nFor a description of the key trends and developments with respect to our business, including further discussion of the\npotential for a further loss of customers as a result of impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine and its impact on our\noperations and financial performance, see —Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Factors Affecting Comparability\nand Results of Operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, which we expect only to become more competitive, and as a result may have difficulty\nexpanding our customer base or retaining existing customers.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive in nature, and we expect that competition will continue to\nincrease. Competition may be intensified by further consolidation of or strategic alliances amongst our competitors, as well as\nnew entrants in our markets. Our strategy is aimed at mitigating against competitive risks by focusing on not only the growth in\nthe number of connections, but also increasing the engagement of and ways of interacting with customers, therefore increasing\nthe revenue generation potential of each of our customers. Our digital services portfolios contribute to the execution of this\nstrategy of higher engagement, contribute to revenue diversification, and help us serve a wider customer base than our\nconnectivity customers. Furthermore, we seek to expand our business-to-business and, separately, digital services, which allow\nfor various revenue generation opportunities beyond traditional connectivity revenues.\nOur financial performance has been and will continue to be impacted by our success in adding, retaining and engaging\nour customers. If our customers do not find our connectivity and digital services valuable, reliable or trustworthy, or otherwise\nbelieve competitors in our markets can offer better services, we may have difficulty retaining and engaging customers, see—\nBusiness Overview.\nEach of the items discussed immediately below regarding the competitive landscape in which we operate could\nmaterially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects:\n• society - or industry-wide impacts creating fundamental changes to customer behavior or customers’ purchasing power,\nand potential regulatory or competitive practices encouraging price-based competition or price caps may harm our\nrevenue growth potential;\n• with the increasing pace of technological developments, including new digital technologies and regulatory changes\nimpacting our industry, we cannot predict future business drivers with certainty and we cannot assure you that we will\nadapt to these changes at a competitive pace, see —We may be unable to keep pace with technological changes and\nevolving industry standards, which could harm our competitive position and, in turn, materially harm our business;\n• we may be forced to utilize more aggressive marketing schemes to retain existing customers and attract new ones that\nmay include lower tariffs, lower fees for digital services, handset subsidies or increased dealer commissions;\n• in more mature or saturated markets, the continued growth of our business and results of operations will depend, in\npart, on our ability to extract greater revenue from our existing customers, including through the expansion of data\nservices and the introduction of next generation technologies, which may prove difficult to accomplish, see —We may\nbe unable to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards, which could harm our competitive\nposition and, in turn, materially harm our business;\n• we may be unable to deliver better customer experience relative to our competitors or our competitors may reach\ncustomers more effectively through better use of digital and physical distribution channels, which may negatively impact\nour market share;\n• as we expand the scope of our services, such as new networks, fixed-line residential and commercial broadband, cloud\nservices, Digital Financial Services (“DFS”) offering (which encompasses a variety of financial services), content\nstreaming, digital health and other services, we may encounter a greater number of competitors that provide similar\nservices;\n• the liberalization of the regulations in certain markets in which we operate could greatly increase competition;\n• competitors may operate more cost-effectively or have other competitive advantages such as greater financial\nresources, market presence and network coverage, stronger brand name recognition, higher customer loyalty and\ngoodwill, and more control over domestic transmission lines;\n88\n• competitors, particularly current and former state-controlled telecommunications service providers, may receive\npreferential treatment from the regulatory authorities and benefit from the resources of their shareholders;\n• current or future relationships among our competitors and third parties may restrict our access to critical systems and\nresources;\n• reduced demand for our traditional voice and, messaging and commoditization of data coupled with the development of\nservices by application developers (commonly referred to as “over-the-top” OTT players) could impact our future\nprofitability;\n• competition from OTT players offering similar functionality to us may increase, including digital providers offering VoIP\ncalling, internet messaging and other digital services which compete with our telecommunications services;\n• our competitors may partner with such OTT players to provide integrated customer experiences, or may choose to\ndevelop their own OTT services, including in bundles, which may increase the customer appeal of their offers and\nconsequently the competition we are facing; and\n• our existing service offerings could become disadvantaged as compared to those offered by competitors who can offer\nbundled combinations of fixed-line, broadband, public Wi-Fi, TV and mobile.\nWe may be unable to execute our current growth strategy due to, among other factors, various barriers to 4G smartphone\nadoption in our markets and may incur capital expenditure intensity above forecasted levels to capture available growth\nopportunities.\n4G-based growth in mobile connectivity, digital services and increasing our customers’ spend across our services (i.e.\nour multiplay strategy) is the cornerstone of our growth strategy. This pursuit of growth by cross selling to our customers across\nour mobile connectivity and digital services has led to higher capital expenditures in some of our markets in 2023, including as a\nresult of investments into our network infrastructure as well as spectrum acquisition and renewals. Our capex intensity was 18%\nas 4G network roll outs continued in 2023 and in the first half of 2024 and, while we aspire to keep our capex intensity between\n18-19% in 2024, we may need to invest more heavily than anticipated to capture the growth opportunities available in some of\nour markets.\nSince 2021, our operating companies have been executing our “digital operator 1440” model pursuant to which we aim\nto enrich our connectivity offering with proprietary digital applications and services. With this model, we aspire to grow not only\nthe market share of our operators, but also the relevance and the wallet share of our businesses and industry by delivering value\nvia, for example, mobile entertainment, mobile health, mobile education, and mobile financial services. However, barriers to 4G\nsmartphone adoption in some of our markets, including heavy taxation of smartphones, price-based competition adopted by\nsome of our competitors, import restrictions, potential introduction of excessive quality-of-service requirements, potential\nlimitations on provision of digital services by connectivity providers, as well as regulatory expectations around the premature\nadoption of 5G in some of our markets together with highly regulated and often times bureaucratic and slow moving licensing\nand regulatory regimes potentially out of step with market requirements, are among the risks we face in the execution of this\nstrategy. For more information on the competition we face in our markets, see —We operate in highly competitive markets, which\nwe expect only to become more competitive, and as a result may have difficulty expanding our customer base or retaining\nexisting customers. For more information on our growth strategy, see —Information on the Company.\nWe may be unable to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards, which could harm our competitive\nposition and, in turn, materially harm our business.\nThe telecommunications industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology, industry standards and service\ndemands, which may vary by country or geographic region. Accordingly, our future success will depend on our ability to\neffectively anticipate and adapt to the changing technological landscape and the resulting regulations.\nWe continue to focus on deploying 4G/LTE which we believe carries significant growth potential in the emerging market\neconomies that we serve, especially when coupled with other measures that can reduce the mobile internet usage gap among\npopulations already within mobile data coverage such as affordability, increased smartphone penetration and relevant content.\nWe invest in expanding the coverage of 4G networks and improving the quality of the mobile voice and data experience,\nincluding through partnerships where relevant. We also upgrade our network for efficient delivery of our services and for 5G-\nready technologies. For example, in Pakistan, we have expanded our network to support advanced 4G technologies, voice over\nLTE and voice over Wi-Fi technologies. However, it is possible that the technologies or equipment we use today will become\nobsolete or subject to competition from new generation technologies for which we may be unable to deploy, or obtain the\nappropriate license, in a timely manner or at all. Also, in some of our markets, 5G is on the regulatory agenda. If our licenses and\nspectrum are not appropriate or sufficient to address changing technology, we may require additional or supplemental licenses\nand spectrum to implement 5G technology or to upgrade our existing 2G, 3G and 4G/LTE networks to remain competitive, and\nwe may be unable to acquire such licenses and spectrum on reasonable terms or at all. Technological change is also impacting\nthe capabilities of equipment our customers use, such as mobile handsets, and potential changes in this area may impact\ndemand for our services in the future. Implementing new technologies requires substantial investment and there can be no\nguarantee that we will generate our expected return on any such investments. We may be unable to develop or maintain\nadditional revenue market share in markets where the potential for additional growth of our customer base is limited and we may\nincur significant capital expenditures as our customers demand new services, technologies and increased access, for example\nour inability to obtain 5G spectrum in Kazakhstan during 2022.\n89\nIf we are not able to effectively anticipate or adapt to these technological changes in the telecommunications market or\nto otherwise compete in a timely and cost-effective manner, we could lose customers, fail to attract new customers, experience\nlower ARPU or incur substantial or unanticipated costs and investments in order to maintain our customer base, all of which\ncould materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nThe changes in regulatory requirements in banking and other financial systems in our countries of operation, and currency\ncontrol requirements in certain countries restrict our activities, including in relation to the ongoing war between Russia and\nUkraine.\nThe banking and other financial systems in our countries of operation are underdeveloped and/or under-regulated, and\nlaws relating to banks and bank accounts are subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application. Uncertain banking\nlaws may also limit our ability to attract future investment in these countries. Such banking risk cannot be completely eliminated\nby diversified borrowing and conducting credit analyses. In addition, underdeveloped banking and financial systems are more\nsusceptible to a banking crisis, which would affect the capacity for financial institutions to lend or fulfill their existing obligations,\nor lead to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the banks from which we receive, or with which we hold, our funds, and could result in\nthe loss of our deposits, the inability to borrow or refinance existing borrowings or otherwise negatively affect our ability to\ncomplete banking transactions in these countries.\nIn addition, the central banks and governments in the markets in our countries of operation may also restrict or prevent\ninternational transfers, or impose foreign exchange controls or other currency restrictions, which could prevent us from making\npayments, including paying dividends and third-party suppliers. Furthermore, banks have limitations on the amounts of loans that\nthey can provide to single borrowers, which could limit the availability of local currency financing and refinancing of existing\nborrowings in these countries. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain approvals under the foregoing\nrestrictions or limitations, which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations or prospects.\nLiquidity and Capital Risks\nOur substantial amounts of indebtedness and debt service obligations could materially decrease our cash flow, which could\nadversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe have substantial amounts of indebtedness and debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30,\n2024, the outstanding principal amount of our external debt for bonds, bank loans and other borrowings amounted to\napproximately US$3.7 billion and US$3.0 billion, respectively, excluding bonds held by our subsidiary. In addition to these\nborrowings, we also have lease liabilities amounting to US$1.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024. For more\ninformation regarding our outstanding indebtedness and debt agreements, see —Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\n—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Indebtedness.\nSome of the agreements under which we borrow funds contain covenants or provisions that impose certain operating\nand financial restrictions on us, including balance sheet solvency, and may prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring\nadditional debt. As our earnings are in local currency, while the majority of our debt is denominated in U.S. dollars, devaluations\nof the currencies of our key markets would make it more difficult to repay our debt. In addition, capital controls and other\nrestrictions, including limitations on payment of interest, dividends or international funds transfers, along with punitive taxes and\npenalties targeted at foreign entities may also impact our liquidity or ability to comply with certain of the above-mentioned ratios.\nSee —Market Risks—Investing in emerging markets, where our operations are located, is subject to greater risks than investing\nin more developed markets, including significant political, legal and economic risks for a further discussion of the risk of\ndeconsolidation. Failure to comply with the covenants or provisions of the agreements under which we borrow funds may result\nin a default, which could increase the cost of securing additional capital, lead to accelerated repayment of our indebtedness or\nresult in the loss of any assets that secure the defaulted indebtedness or to which our creditors otherwise have recourse. A\ndefault or acceleration of the obligations under one or more of these agreements (including as a result of cross-default or cross-\nacceleration) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and in\nparticular on our liquidity and our shareholders’ equity. In addition, covenants in certain of our debt agreements could restrict our\nliquidity and our ability to expand or finance our future operations. For a discussion of agreements under which we borrow funds\nand a description of how that has changed since December 31, 2023, see Note 16—Investments, Debt and Derivatives and Note\n23—Events After the Reporting Period to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Aside from the risk of default, given our\nsubstantial amounts of indebtedness and the limits imposed by our debt obligations, our business could suffer significant\nnegative consequences such as the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of\nour debt, thereby reducing funds available for paying dividends, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures\nand other purposes necessary for us to maintain our competitive position, flexibility and resiliency in the face of general adverse\neconomic or industry conditions.\nFollowing the onset of the war between Russia and Ukraine, our ability to upstream cash from Ukraine has been\nmaterially impaired, due to increased volatility of the Ukrainian hryvnia and tightened currency controls within Ukraine, currently\nrestricting cash upstreaming from this country. In addition, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the developments since with\nrespect to sanctions have limited our access to the debt capital markets in which we have traditionally refinanced maturing debt\nand has impacted our ability to refinance our indebtedness. As a result of the sanctions and regulations, the international clearing\nsystems have stopped payments in Russian ruble which prevents the repayment of our Russian ruble denominated notes in\nRussian ruble, as a result of which we anticipate the settlement of the coupon and principal of Russian ruble denominated notes\n90\nwill continue to be in United States Dollars, subject to compliance with sanctions. For more information, please refer Item 5—\nOperating and Financial Review and Prospects— Key Developments after the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2024, we had approximately US$1.9 billion (including US$165 million at\nMobilink Microfinance Bank Ltd. (“MMBL”)) and US$0.9 billion (including US$140 million MMBL) of cash, respectively, of which\nUS$1.3 billion and US$0.4 billion was held at the HQ-level at these respective dates. Despite our current liquidity levels, there\ncan be no assurance that our existing cash balances will be sufficient over the medium term to service our existing indebtedness,\nincluding to address our bond maturities. See —Operational Risks—As a holding company with a number of operating\nsubsidiaries, we depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or make other transfers to\nVEON Ltd., as well as the ability to make certain intercompany payments and transfers. For a discussion of our current liquidity\nprofile in the wake of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, see —Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital, or we may only be able to raise additional capital at significantly increased costs.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, including through debt financing. If we incur additional\nindebtedness, the risks that we now face related to our indebtedness and debt service obligations could increase. See—Our\nsubstantial amounts of indebtedness and debt service obligations could materially decrease our cash flow, which could adversely\naffect our business and financial condition above.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, and the cost of raising additional capital, is affected by the strength of our credit\nrating by rating agencies. In March 2024, Fitch and S&P each published their assigned credit ratings to VEON, after withdrawing\nit in 2022 due to our then-significant Russian operations. If VEON’s credit ratings were lowered or withdrawn again in the future,\nit could negatively impact our ability to utilize the capital markets to secure credit or funding.\nIn addition, economic sanctions that have been imposed in connection with the war between Russia and Ukraine have\nalso negatively affected our existing financing arrangements and may affect our ability to secure future external financing due to\nan unwillingness of banks, and other debt investors to transact with, provide loans or purchase bonds of entities with significant\nindirect share ownership by Russian entities or individuals. For example, the sanctions introduced have led certain vendors and\nbanking partners to reassess and, in some instances, to significantly scale back their services to us. See—Market Risks—We\nhave suffered reputational harm as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in the market in which we want to raise it, or at all, or if the cost of raising\nadditional capital significantly increases, as is the case when central banks raise benchmark interest rates, we may be unable to\nmake necessary or desired capital expenditures, take advantage of investment opportunities, refinance existing indebtedness or\nmeet unexpected financial requirements, and our growth strategy and liquidity may be negatively affected. This could cause us to\nbe unable to repay indebtedness as it comes due, to delay or abandon anticipated expenditures and investments or otherwise\nlimit operations. See—Market Risks—We are exposed to foreign currency exchange loss, fluctuation and translation risks,\nincluding as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and—Market Risks—The international economic\nenvironment, inflationary pressures, geopolitical developments and unexpected global events could cause our business to\ndecline.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, including the current rising interest rate environment due to\nour indebtedness.\nWe have issued bonds and have bank financing at our operating subsidiaries that are based on floating rates, such as the\nPakistan based KIBOR. Rising interest rates due to governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and\npolitical conditions and other factors beyond our control may escalate the interest amounts due on these bonds and may have a\nnegative impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, we had the\nfollowing principal amounts outstanding for floating rate interest-bearing loans and bonds: US$1,696 million and US$920 million,\nrespectively. For more information on our indebtedness, see —Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and\nCapital Resources—Indebtedness.\nA change in control of VEON Ltd. or VEON Holdings B.V. could require us to prepay certain indebtedness.\nCertain of our financing agreements have “change of control” provisions that may require us to make a prepayment if a\nperson or group of persons (with limited exclusions) directly or indirectly acquire beneficial or legal ownership of or control over\nmore than 50.0% of our share capital or the ability to appoint a majority of directors to our board. If such a change of control\nprovision is triggered, and we fail to agree necessary amendments to any given loan documentation, then the prepayment\nprovision will be triggered under such loan. Failure to make any such required prepayment could trigger cross-default or cross-\nacceleration provisions of our other financing agreements, which could lead to our obligations being declared immediately due\nand payable. A change of control could also impact other contracts and relationships with third parties and may require a\nrenegotiation or reorganization of certain contracts or undertakings.\nOperational Risks\nWe have experienced and are continually exposed to cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity threats, both to our own operations\nor those of our third party providers, that may lead to compromised or inaccessible telecommunications, digital and financial\n91\nservices and/or leaks or unauthorized processing of confidential information, and perceptions of such threats may cause\ncustomers to lose confidence in our services.\nDue to the nature of the services we offer across our geographical footprint and those we receive from third parties, we\nhave in the past experienced and are continually exposed to cybersecurity threats that have negatively impacted our business\nactivities and could continue to impact our business activities through service degradation, alteration or disruption, including a\nrisk of unauthorized access to our systems or those of third parties. These cybersecurity threats could be carried out against us\nor against third parties from which we receive services, networks or data by private or state-sponsored third parties through\nexploiting unidentified existing or new weaknesses or flaws in our or a third parties’ network or IT systems or disruption by\ncomputer malware or other technical or operational issues. Cybersecurity threats could also lead to the compromise of our\nphysical assets dedicated to processing or storing customer, employee, financial data and strategic business information, which\nhas in the past and could in the future result in exposing this information to possible leakage, unauthorized dissemination and\nloss of confidentiality.\nAs each of our operating subsidiaries is responsible for managing its own cybersecurity risks and putting in place all\noperational preventive, detective and response capabilities, our operations and business continuity is dependent on how well\nthese subsidiaries collectively protect and maintain our network equipment, information technology (“IT”) systems and other\nassets. While we invest in improving our IT and security systems at each of our operating subsidiaries, some of our subsidiaries\nrely on older versions of operating systems and applications that may lead to vulnerabilities in our IT network. Although we\ndevote significant resources to obtaining and maintaining ISO certification, best practices sharing, cyber security tools sharing,\ncross-border cooperation and continued improvement of our IT and security systems, we are and will continue to remain\nvulnerable to cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity threats that could lead to compromised or inaccessible telecommunications,\ndigital and financial services and/or leaks or unauthorized processing of confidential information, including customer information.\nOur systems can be potentially vulnerable to harmful viruses and the spread of malicious software that could compromise the\nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of technology assets. In addition, unauthorized users or hackers may potentially access and\nprocess the customer and business information we hold, or authorized users may improperly process such data. Though well-\nstructured work to address those challenges i ongoing, such risks are inherent in our business operations and we will never be\nable to fully insulate ourselves from these risks.\nMoreover, we may potentially experience cyber-attacks and IT and network failures and outages due to factors under\nour control, such as malfunction of technology assets or services caused by obsolescence, wear or defects in design or\nmanufacturing, faults during standard or extraordinary maintenance procedures, compromised staff user accounts (including due\nto credential theft and password reuse or sharing), unforeseen absence of key personnel, the inability to protect our systems\nfrom phishing attacks or as a result of attacks against third parties that provide IT and network services to us. There is also a\npossibility that we are not currently aware of certain undisclosed vulnerabilities in our IT systems, processes and other assets or\nthose at third parties that provide such services to us. In such an event, hackers or other cybercrime groups (whether private or\nstate-sponsored) may exploit such vulnerabilities, weaknesses or unidentified backdoors (including previously unidentified\ndesigned weaknesses embedded into network or IT equipment allowing access by private or government actors) or may be able\nto cause harm more quickly than we are able to mitigate (zero-day exploits). In addition, we have identified unauthorized access\nto some of our network systems, possibly with the intention to capture information or manipulate the communications. In some of\ncountries of operation, our equipment for the provision of mobile services resides in a limited number of locations or buildings,\nand disruption to the security or operation of these locations or buildings could result in disruption of our mobile services in those\nregions. Moreover, the implementation of our business transformation strategies may result in under-investments or failures in\ninternal business processes, which may in turn result in greater vulnerability to technical or operational issues, including harm\nfrom failure to detect malware.\nFurthermore, due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, there is an increased risk of cyber-attacks or\ncybersecurity incidents that could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. While most cyber security attacks have been\nsuccessfully mitigated, any attempts by cyber-attackers to disrupt our services or systems, if successful, could harm our\nbusiness, result in the misappropriation of funds, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation or brands. Following the\nonset of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, there have been an increasing number of cyber-attacks on our\ninformation systems and critical infrastructure, which have caused service disruptions in certain instances. For example, on\nDecember 12, 2023, we announced that the network of our Ukrainian subsidiary Kyivstar had been the target of a widespread\nexternal cyber-attack causing a technical failure. This resulted in a temporary disruption of Kyivstar's network and services,\ninterrupting the provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and fixed networks, international roaming, and SMS services,\namongst others, for Kyivstar customers in Ukraine and abroad. Following the cyber-attack, we conducted a high-level risk\nassessment of our IT infrastructure and identified the following risks associated with our operations: data leakage, compromised\nuser accounts (including due to credential theft and password reuse), ransomware attacks on our various servers and files and\nmalware attacks. While we have worked to remediate these vulnerabilities, we may find other vulnerabilities and we expect to\nremain subject to continued cyber-attacks in the future.\nAs a holding company with a number of operating subsidiaries, we depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their\nability to pay dividends or make other transfers to VEON Holdings B.V., as well as the ability to make certain intercompany\npayments and transfers.\nVEON Holdings B.V. is a holding company and does not conduct any revenue-generating business operations of its\nown. Its principal assets are the direct and indirect equity interests it owns in its operating subsidiaries and as a result, VEON\nHoldings B.V. depends on cash dividends, distributions, management fees, loans or other transfers received from its subsidiaries\n92\nto make dividend payments to its shareholder, and service interest and principal payments in respect of the indebtedness\nincurred at its intermediate holding companies, and to meet other obligations. The ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends and\nmake other transfers to VEON Holdings B.V. is not guaranteed, as it depends on the success of their businesses and may be\nrestricted by applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations. Such restrictions include restrictions on dividends,\nlimitations on repatriation of cash and earnings and on the making of loans and repayment of debts, monetary transfer\nrestrictions, covenants in our financing agreements, and foreign currency exchange controls and related restrictions in certain\nagreements or certain jurisdictions in which VEON Holdings B.V.’s subsidiaries operate or both.\nSimilarly, at times our local operating subsidiaries depend on support received from us through cash generated in other\njurisdictions or through debt incurred at the Group-level to make capital expenditures, service debt or to meet other obligations.\nThe ability of an operating subsidiary to receive from, or make a transfer to, another Group entity can be limited by cash\nrestrictions imposed by governments or restrictions in private contracts. The inability to make payments and/or transfer funds\nwithin the Group could limit or prohibit the payment of cash dividends, distributions, the repayment of indebtedness or payment\nof debt servicing obligations and thus could result in a default under any such instruments.\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has impaired our ability to make cash transfers into and out of Ukraine.\nIn Ukraine, capital controls were introduced by the National Bank of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 in connection with the\ndeclaration of martial law which prohibit our Ukrainian subsidiary from making any interest or dividend payments to us and\ntransferring foreign currency to entities outside of Ukraine and are expected to last for the duration of the application of martial\nlaw. Currently, it is not possible to predict how long the martial law in Ukraine will last. As a result of the above, we do not expect\nto receive interest or dividend payments from our Ukrainian operations in the foreseeable future.\nFurthermore, VEON Holdings B.V.’s ability to withdraw funds and dividends from our subsidiaries and operating\ncompanies may depend on the consent of our strategic partners, where applicable.\nFor more information on the legal and regulatory risks associated with our markets and restrictions on dividend\npayments, see—Regulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks—The telecommunications industry is a highly regulated industry and\nwe are subject to an extensive variety of laws and operate in uncertain judicial and regulatory environments, which may result in\nunanticipated outcomes that could harm our business and—Market Risks—The changes in regulatory requirements in banking\nand other financial systems in our countries of operation, and currency control requirements in certain countries restrict our\nactivities, including in relation to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, respectively.\nOur equipment and systems are subject to disruption and failure for various reasons, including as a result of the ongoing war in\nUkraine, which could cause us to lose customers, limit our growth, violate our licenses or reduce the confidence of our customers\nin our ability to securely hold their personal data.\nOur technological infrastructure and other property are vulnerable to damage or disruptions from numerous events. These\ninclude natural disasters, extreme weather and other environmental conditions, military conflicts, power outages, terrorist acts,\nriots, government shutdown orders, changes in government regulation, equipment or system failures or an inability to access or\noperate such equipment or systems, human error or intentional wrongdoings, such as breaches of our network, cyber-attacks or\nany other types of information technology security threats. For example, we may experience network or technology failures, or a\nleak or unauthorized processing of confidential customer data, if our technology assets are altered, damaged, destroyed or\nmisused by employees, third parties or other users, either intentionally or due to human error. In addition, as we operate in\ncountries that may have an increased threat of terrorism and military conflicts, incidents on or near our premises, equipment or\npoints of sale could result in causalities, property damage, business interruption, legal liability and damage to our brand or\nreputation. For example, while we have managed thus far to repair most of our network assets that incurred damage in Ukrainian\nterritory not under Russian occupation, as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine there can be no assurance\nthat our Ukrainian network will not sustain major damage or that such damage can be repaired in a timely manner as the war\ncontinues. In addition, with increased targeting of Ukraine’s electrical grid, we have faced challenges ensuring that our network\nassets have a power source. While we have taken measures to manage this risk, there can be no assurance that we will be able\nto obtain sufficient power sources in the future. See “Market Risks--The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is having, and\nwill continue to have, an impact on our business financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects” and\n“Operational Risks-We have experienced and are continually exposed to cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity threats, both to\nour own operations or those of our third party providers, that may lead to compromised or inaccessible telecommunications,\ndigital and financial services and/or leaks or unauthorized processing of confidential information, and perceptions of such threats\nmay cause customers to lose confidence in our services.\nInterruptions of services due to disruption or failure of our equipment and systems could harm our reputation and\nreduce the confidence of our customers to provide them with reliable services and hold their personal data. As a result, this could\nimpair our ability to obtain and retain customers and could lead to a violation of the terms of our licenses, each of which could\nmaterially harm our business. In addition, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the business\ninterruption insurance we maintain.\nOur reputation could be adversely impacted by negative developments in respect of the Beeline brand, which remains a\ntrademark of our former subsidiary, VimpelCom (as defined below). If we elect to undertake a rebranding exercise, it may involve\nsubstantial costs and may not produce the intended benefits if it is not favorably received by our existing and potential\ncustomers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship.\n93\nFollowing the completion of the sale of our Russian Operations, each of our operating subsidiaries in Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan entered into amended and restated trademark license agreements with VimpelCom, pursuant to\nwhich each operating company maintains its existing non-exclusive license in relation to the “Beeline” name and associated\ntrademarks (each a “License Agreement”, and collectively the “License Agreements”). Each License Agreement is for an initial\nfive-year term and the termination rights previously held by VimpelCom therein have been narrowed as compared to the original\nlicense agreement; no additional fees were added as part of these amendments. The License Agreements are subject to certain\nrestrictions that may affect the operating subsidiaries’ business. For example, when using the trademarks, the operating\nsubsidiaries shall comply with the requirements of the Russian legislation and avoid using the Beeline trademarks in a way that\nmay be to the detriment of the “Beeline” brand. The License Agreements cover only the trademarks the operating subsidiaries\nwere using as of the date of the License Agreements (and similar trademarks). The subsidiaries may register new trademarks\nrelated to the “Beeline” brand only in the name and on behalf of VimpelCom subject to VimpelCom’s approval and such new\ntrademarks will fall within the scope of the License Agreements. VimpelCom may terminate a License Agreement if the relevant\nlicensee does not comply with certain terms of the applicable License Agreement.\nWe cannot predict with certainty how the continued use of legacy Beeline branding following the sale of our Russian\nOperations will affect our reputation and performance. VimpelCom retains the right to continue using the “Beeline” name and\nmark and the License Agreements do not preclude the licensor from also licensing the “Beeline” name and mark to other third\nparties, though VimpelCom cannot grant or use the Beeline license to compete directly with us in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and\nUzbekistan. As a result, events or conduct by VimpelCom or any other third parties holding the rights or licensing rights to the\n“Beeline” brand that reflect negatively on the “Beeline” brand in our markets may adversely affect our reputation or the reputation\nof the “Beeline” brand on which we will be relying. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent any damage to goodwill that may\noccur as a result of the activities of VimpelCom and any third-party licensee of the Beeline brand in relation to the “Beeline”\nbrand.\nIt is expected that following the expiration of the initial five-year term of the License Agreements, each of the operating\nsubsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan may agree with VimpelCom to extend the term of its applicable License\nAgreement so that the operating subsidiary can continue to use the “Beeline” brand. However, since the License Agreements do\nnot have any renewal terms, such extension may be subject to new terms that differ significantly from the current terms of the\nLicense Agreement to the detriment of the operating subsidiaries. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that any operating\ncompany that chooses to pursue an extended license term will be able to negotiate an extension on commercially reasonable\nterms, or at all.\nAlternatively, we may undertake a re-branding exercise in respect of any one or more of our operating subsidiaries that\nuse the “Beeline” brand. We anticipate that any such rebranding strategy will involve substantial costs and may not produce the\nintended benefits if it is received unfavorably by our existing and potential customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we\nhave a business relationship. Successful promotion of the rebranding will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts\nand our ability to continue to provide reliable products to customers during the course of our rebranding transition. We cannot\nguarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain brand recognition, awareness or status under any new brand names and/or\ntrademarks at a level that is comparable to the recognition and status we historically enjoyed under the Beeline brand. If our\nrebranding strategy does not produce the intended benefits, our ability to retain existing customers, suppliers and other persons\nwith whom we have a business relationship and continue to attract new customer and engage new business partners may be\nnegatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe depend on third parties for certain services and equipment, infrastructure and other products important to our business.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services and products important for our operations. For example, we currently\npurchase the majority of our network-related equipment from a core number of suppliers, such as Ericsson, Huawei, ZTE, and\nNokia. The successful build-out and operation of our networks depends heavily on obtaining adequate supplies of core and\ntransmission telecommunications equipment, fiber, switching equipment, radio access network solutions, base stations and other\nservices and products on a timely basis. From time to time, we have experienced delays in receiving equipment, installation of\nequipment, and maintenance services, due to factors such as new and existing telecommunications regulations, customs\nregulations and governmental investigations or enforcement actions. If this is the case, we may experience temporary service\ninterruptions or service quality problems. As we seek to execute our “asset-light” business model and dispose of our tower\nassets, as we have partially done in Bangladesh through a sale completed in January 2024, we will become more exposed to\nrisks associated with our network service partners, including their ability to adequately maintain the tower infrastructure and\nprovide use of it to us through network service agreements.\nSince the onset of the war between Russia and Ukraine, certain of our business partners have expressed hesitancy or\nunwillingness to continue to do business with us and concern regarding our ability to perform our existing business contracts,\nincluding as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and due to the challenges that sanctions on certain of our\nbeneficial owners pose to our operations. Several existing and prospective business partners and service providers have\ndeclined to conduct business with us as a result and others may do so in the future. For further discussion, see —Market Risks\n—The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is having, and will continue to have, an impact on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. For a further discussion of how the ongoing war between Russia and\nUkraine will affect our ability to transact with our suppliers, see —Market Risks—The international economic environment,\ninflationary pressures, geopolitical developments and unexpected global events could cause our business to decline.\nFurthermore, even if an entity, such as VEON, is not formally subject to sanctions, customers and business partners have\ndecided and may decide to reevaluate or cancel projects for reputational or other reasons. Depending on the extent and breadth\n94\nof sanctions, export controls and other measures that have been and may be imposed on us or other parties affiliated with us,\nsuch as our direct or indirect shareholders, in connection with the war in Ukraine and the response of our business partners in\nresponse to such controls, our business, financial condition and results of operations has in the past and could in the future\nmaterially and adversely affect us.\nWe do not have direct operational or financial control over our key suppliers and have limited influence with respect to\nthe manner in which these key suppliers conduct their businesses. Our business, including key network and IT projects, could be\nmaterially impacted by disruptions to our key suppliers’ businesses or supply chains, due to factors such as significant\ngeopolitical events, changes in law or regulation, the introduction of restrictions to curb epidemics or pandemics, as seen in the\ncurrent COVID-19 pandemic, trade tensions and export and re-export restrictions. Any of these factors could affect our suppliers’\nability to procure goods, software or technology necessary for the service, production and satisfactory delivery of the supplies,\nsupport services, and equipment that we source from them. For example, in May and August 2019, the U.S. Department of\nCommerce added Huawei and 114 of its affiliates to its “Entity List”, prohibiting companies globally from directly or indirectly\nexporting, re-exporting or transferring (in-country) all items subject to U.S. export control jurisdiction to Huawei without\nauthorization and procuring items from Huawei when they know or have reason to know that the items were originally procured\nby Huawei in violation of U.S. export control regulations. In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce further expanded its\nexport control restrictions targeting Huawei. This development continues to be a factor in the management of our supply chain.\nFurther restrictions adopted by the United States, or any other applicable jurisdiction, on Huawei could potentially have a\nsignificant impact on our operations in certain markets where we are reliant on Huawei equipment or services. Specifically, any\nrestriction on Huawei’s ability to deliver equipment or services, or on our ability to receive such equipment or services, could\nadversely impact our business, the operation of our networks and our ability to comply with the terms of our operating licenses\nand local laws and regulations.\nWe have and may continue to outsource all or a portion of construction, maintenance services, IT infrastructure hosting\nand network capabilities in certain markets. For example, our digital stacks and data management platforms are dependent on\nthird-parties and we have also entered into outsourcing initiatives in a number of our countries of operation, including\nKazakhstan. As a result, our business could be materially harmed if our agreements with third parties were to terminate, if our\npartners experience certain negative developments (financial, legal, regulatory or otherwise), if they become unwilling or unable\nto service our businesses in Ukraine or elsewhere, or a dispute between us and such parties occurs, which causes our suppliers\nto be unable to fulfill their obligations under our agreements with them on a timely basis, or at all. If such events occur, we may\nattempt to renegotiate the terms of such agreements with the third parties. However, there can be no assurance that the terms of\nsuch amended agreements will be more favorable to us than those of the original agreements. For more information, see —\nProperty, Plants and Equipment. We also depend on third parties, including software providers and service providers, for our\nday-to-day business operations.\nWe cannot assure you that our suppliers will continue to provide services and products to us at attractive prices or that\nwe will be able to obtain such services and products in the future from these or other suppliers on the scale and within the time\nframes we require, if at all. If our suppliers are unable to provide us with adequate services and products or provide them in a\ntimely manner, our ability to attract customers or offer attractive product offerings could be negatively affected, which in turn\ncould materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nMany of our mobile products and services are sold to customers through third party channels. These third-party\nretailers, agents and dealers that we use to distribute and sell products are not under our control and may stop distributing or\nselling our products at any time or may more actively promote the products and services of our competitors. Should this occur\nwith particularly important retailers, agents or dealers, we may face difficulty in finding new retailers, sales agents or dealers that\ncan generate the same level of revenue. In addition, mobile handset providers are at times subject to supply constraints,\nparticularly when there is high demand for a particular handset or when there is a shortage of components.\nOur business depends on our ability to effectively implement our strategic initiatives and if they are not successfully\nimplemented, the benefits we expect to achieve may not be realized.\nThe success of our business depends, to a large extent, on our ability to effectively implement our corporate and\noperational strategies. We continue to transform our business with the aim of improving our operations across all our markets.\nOur strategy framework is comprised of three vectors: infrastructure, digital operator 1440 and digital assets. As part of this\nstrategy, we are focusing on growing customer engagement and retention through expanding our growth opportunities beyond\ntraditional voice and access data provision into new digitally-enabled services. We are also developing new IT capabilities,\nincluding local platforms that enable our customers to manage their accounts, services and customer relationship independently\n(“self-care”) and consume digital applications (e.g. mobile entertainment, financial services) for personal or business needs, in\norder to improve customer engagement. We have also been focused on identifying, acquiring and developing “know-how” and\ntechnologies that open up adjacent growth opportunities, updating our networks (including through an asset light strategy\nresulting in the sale or potential sale of some of our tower assets to reputable partners), developing enterprise resource\nmanagement systems, human capital management systems and enterprise performance management systems, both for our\ninternal usage and as IT products at the service of our enterprise customers. For example, in August 2022, our subsidiary\nKyivstar acquired a controlling stake in Helsi Ukraine, one of the country’s largest medical information systems and leading\ndigital healthcare providers, which Kyivstar continued to develop further in 2023 as part of the “Digital Ukraine” strategy. In\naddition, we have been working under a distributed governance model since 2022 that empowers operating companies with the\nauthority and accountability to manage their operations (subject to certain limits) and more efficiently capitalize on local insight,\nand have also been encouraging our operating companies to create technology subsidiaries that serve a broader scope of\n95\ncustomers with innovative products. One such example of this is QazCode in Kazakhstan, which was spun off from Beeline\nKazakhstan in 2023. The launch of QazCode, the 4th largest IT company in Kazakhstan, is also part of the digital operator\nstrategy aimed at combining connectivity with a complete digital product and services portfolio that meets local needs, including\nin mobile financial services, entertainment, health, and education and others.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully, within our estimated budget and/or on time,\nor that it will generate the results we expect. We may experience implementation issues due to a lack of coordination or\ncooperation with our operating companies or third parties, significant change in key personnel, economic and logistical effects of\nthe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, or otherwise encounter unforeseen issues, such as technological limitations,\nregulatory constraints, lack of customer engagement, or increased customer acquisition costs due to increased market\nsaturation, which could frustrate our expectations regarding cost-optimization and process redesign or otherwise delay or hinder\nexecution of these initiatives. Any inability on our part to implement our strategy effectively could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nIn addition, the onset of the war between Russia and Ukraine disrupted our strategic plans and diverted management’s\nattention from such initiatives while they focused and continue to focus on the impact the war between Russia and Ukraine had\nand continues to have on our business, including managing the sanctions and liquidity challenges that arise for the Company as\na result of the current sanctions regime. In addition, management’s attention has been diverted from operations in other\ncountries, as they continue to focus on our operations in Ukraine. The continuation or escalation of the war in Ukraine and its\nindirect consequences may increase our need for prudent cash management and reduce our appetite for investments in other\ncountries. At the Group-level, we might be unable to implement certain strategic initiatives if such initiatives require cash\ncontributions from our operations in Ukraine, since tightened currency controls within Ukraine currently restrict cash upstreaming\nand may persist for some time. In addition, we also face some restrictions for cash upstreaming from our operations in Pakistan\ndue to the remittance and dividend restrictions that remain imposed by the State Bank of Pakistan for corporations operating in\nthe country. The diversion of management’s attention or funds and the lack of dividend upstreaming, and any resulting disruption\nto our strategic plans, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nOur strategic partnerships and relationships carry inherent business risks.\nWe participate in strategic partnerships and joint ventures in a number of countries, including telecommunications\nproviders in Kazakstan (i.e. KaR-Tel LLP) and Kyrgyzstan (“Sky Mobile” LLC), a digital health service platform in Ukraine (Helsi\nUkraine) and a long-term services agreement (with Summit Towers Limited) in connection with our “asset-light” approach in\nBangladesh. We also hold minority investments in e-commerce platforms in Bangladesh (ShopUp) and Pakistan (Dastgyr).\nWe also hold minority investments in e-commerce platforms in Bangladesh (ShopUp) and Pakistan (Dastgyr). We do not always\nhave a controlling stake in our affiliated companies and even when we do, our actions with respect to these affiliated companies\nmay be restricted by the shareholders’ agreements entered into with our strategic partners and our ability to withdraw funds and\ndividends from or exit our investment in these entities may depend on the consent and cooperation of our partners. If\ndisagreements develop with our partners, or any existing disagreements are exacerbated, our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, cash flows or prospects may be harmed.\nIn addition, we do not have direct control over the conduct of our strategic partners. If any of them become the subject\nof an investigation, sanctions or liability, or do not act in accordance with our standards of conduct, our reputation and business\nmight be adversely affected. Furthermore, strategic partnerships in emerging markets are accompanied by risks inherent to\nthose markets, such as an increased possibility of a partner defaulting on obligations or losing a partner with important insights in\nthat region. In addition, some of the businesses for which we are not a controlling shareholder operate in highly-regulated\nmarkets, such as ShopUp, and as a result we cannot ensure that these businesses remain compliant with intellectual property,\nlicensing and content restrictions. We could also determine that a partnership or joint venture no longer yields the benefits that\nwe expected to achieve and may decide to exit such initiative, which may result in significant transaction costs or an inferior\noutcome than was expected when we entered into the partnership or joint venture. For a discussion of how the ongoing war\nbetween Russia and Ukraine could affect our ability to transact with strategic partners and joint ventures, see —Market Risks—\nThe international economic environment, inflationary pressures, geopolitical developments and unexpected global events could\ncause our business to decline.\nWe depend on our senior management, board of directors, and highly skilled personnel, and, if we are unable to retain or\nmotivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or implement our strategic goals or corporate culture through our personnel, we\nmay not be able to maintain our competitive position or to implement our business strategy.\nOur performance and ability to maintain our competitive position and to implement our business strategy is dependent\non the continuity of our global senior management team and highly skilled personnel. Competition in our markets of operation for\nqualified personnel with relevant expertise is intense, and there can be a limited availability of individuals with the requisite\nknowledge and relevant experience of the telecommunications and digital services industries and, in the case of expatriates, the\nability or willingness to accept work assignments in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have experienced in\nrecent years, and may continue to experience, certain changes in key management and our board of directors. The ongoing war\nbetween Russia and Ukraine, including any adverse publicity relating to us as a result of some of our shareholder ties to Russia\n96\nor otherwise, may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key talent, including senior management, both at the Group\nlevel and also within our key markets.\nFurthermore, we may not succeed in instilling our corporate culture and values in our personnel, which could delay or\nhamper the implementation of our strategic priorities, or our compensation schemes may not always be successful in attracting,\nretaining and motivating our personnel. Our success is also dependent on our personnel’s ability to adapt to rapidly changing\nenvironments and to perform in line with continuous innovations and industry developments. We also may, from time to time,\nmake adjustments or changes to our operating and governance model and there is a risk in such instances that our personnel\nmay not adapt effectively. For example, in connection with our plan to move the VEON Group headquarters from Amsterdam to\nthe Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), although we have offered Amsterdam-based headquarter employees relocation\nplans to move to Dubai, some have chosen not to. We therefore risk losing valuable institutional knowledge and will incur\nemployee severance costs in connection with our planned HQ move to Dubai. Furthermore, while we devote significant attention\nto recruiting, training and instilling personnel with our corporate values and culture, there can be no assurance that our existing\npersonnel, including those who have relocated, as well as the new personnel we hire to replace Amsterdam-based employees\nwho have chosen not to, will successfully be able to adapt to and support our strategic objectives.\nThe loss of any members of our senior management or our key personnel or an inability to attract, train, retain and\nmotivate qualified members of senior management or highly skilled personnel could have an adverse impact on our ability to\ncompete and to implement our business strategy, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash\nflows or prospects.\nThe telecommunications industry is highly capital intensive and requires substantial and ongoing expenditures of capital.\nOur business is highly capital intensive and requires significant amounts of cash to improve and maintain our networks.\nIn some of our countries of operation, the physical infrastructure, including transportation networks, power generation and\ntransmission and communications systems is in poor condition. Supply chain issues arising from the war in Ukraine, component\nbacklogs or other issues, including but not limited to export control regulations, may result in significant increases to our costs,\ncapital expenditure or inability to access equipment and technology required for business continuity or expansion. Our success\nalso depends to a significant degree on our ability to keep pace with new developments in technology, to develop and market\ninnovative products and to update our facilities and process technology, which will require additional capital expenditure in the\nfuture.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to enable us to\nfund our capital expenditures or investments. The amount and timing of our capital requirements will depend on many factors\nover which we have little or no control, including acceptance of and demand for our products and services, the extent to which\nwe invest in new technology and research and development projects, the status and timing of competitive developments, and\ncertain regulatory requirements. For example, if network usage develops faster than we anticipate, we may require greater\ncapital investments in shorter time frames than originally anticipated and we may not have the resources to make such\ninvestments.\nFurthermore, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine creates uncertainty regarding our capital expenditure plans\nas we need to retain more flexibility to maintain our infrastructure in Ukraine and respond to the war as it develops further, and\ninvestment in Ukraine may be complicated by sanctions, regulations, payment restrictions and geopolitical circumstances. Since\nthe onset of the war, a material portion of our uncommitted capital expenditure plans throughout the Group have been delayed.\nSee —Market Risks—The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is having, and will continue to have, an impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects and —Market Risks—We have suffered\nreputational harm as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed. Any further escalation\nor prolonged continuation of the war could lead to more damage to the network, change in customer behavior, declines in gross\nconnections and lower than expected ARPU due to the decline in the Ukrainian economy. Such factors have and, if continued,\nmay continue to limit our ability to fund capital expenditures in Ukraine. We may need to continue to spend a significant amount\nof capital to repair or replace infrastructure and other systems to ensure consistency of our services in Ukraine as the war\ncontinues.\nAlthough we regularly consider and take measures to improve our capital efficiency, including selling capital intensive\nsegments of our business (such as our Bangladesh towers partial portfolio sale which completed in January 2024) and entering\ninto managed services and network sharing agreements with respect to towers and other assets, our levels of capital\nexpenditure will remain significant. If we do not have sufficient resources from our operations or asset sales to finance necessary\ncapital expenditures or we are unable to access funds sufficient to finance necessary capital expenditures, we may be required\nto raise additional debt or equity financing, which may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or at all. See —\nLiquidity and Capital Risks—We may not be able to raise additional capital, or we may only be able to raise additional capital at\nsignificantly increased costs for a further discussion. We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the\nfuture to meet our capital expenditure needs, develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities or\nrespond to competitive pressures, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows or prospects. For more information on our future liquidity needs, see —Operating and Financial Review\nand Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Future Liquidity and Capital Requirements.\nInitiatives to merge with or acquire other companies or businesses, divest our companies, businesses or assets or to otherwise\ninvest in or form strategic partnerships with third parties may divert management attention and resources away from our\n97\nunderlying business operations, and such efforts may not yield the benefits that were expected, or subject us to additional\nliabilities and higher costs from integration efforts or otherwise.\nAs part of our business strategy, we seek from time to time to: merge with or acquire other companies or businesses;\ndivest our companies or businesses or assets; and form strategic partnerships through investments, the formation of joint\nventures, commercial cooperation, or otherwise. We may pursue one or a number of these strategies for various reasons,\nincluding to: simplify our corporate structure; pursue optimal competitive positions in markets in which we have operations; divest\ncertain operations, business lines or assets, including infrastructure and tower assets; acquire more frequency spectrum; acquire\nnew technologies and service capabilities; share our networks or infrastructure; add new customers; increase market\npenetration; expand into new or enhance digital services such as DFS, mobile entertainment, or other forms of digital content;\nand expand into new markets.\nOur ability to implement successful mergers, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or investments depends upon our\nability to identify, evaluate, negotiate the terms of, complete and integrate suitable businesses and to obtain any necessary\nfinancing and the prior approval of any relevant regulatory bodies. These efforts could divert the attention of our management\nand key personnel from our underlying business operations. Following any such merger, acquisition, strategic partnerships or\ninvestment or failure of any such transaction to materialize (including any such failure caused by regulatory or third-party\nchallenges), we may experience:\n• difficulties in realizing expected synergies and investment returns from acquired companies, joint ventures,\ninvestments or other forms of strategic partnerships;\n• unsuccessful integration of personnel, products, property and technologies of the acquired business or assets;\n• higher or unforeseen costs of integration or capital expenditures (including the time and resources of our personnel\nrequired to successfully integrate any combined businesses);\n• adverse changes in our operating efficiencies and structure;\n• difficulties relating to the combined business’ compliance with telecommunications or other regulatory licenses and\npermissions, compliance with laws, regulations and contractual obligations, ability to obtain and maintain favorable\ncommercial terms, and ability to optimize and protect our assets (including spectrum and intellectual property);\n• adverse market reactions stemming from competitive and other pressures;\n• difficulties in retaining key employees of the merged or acquired business or strategic partnerships who are\nnecessary to manage the relevant businesses;\n• risks related to loss of full control of a merged business, or not having the ability to adequately control and manage\nan acquired business, strategic partnership or investment, including disagreements or difference in strategy with\njoint venture partners;\n• risks that different geographic regions present, such as currency exchange risks, competition, regulatory, political,\neconomic and social developments, which may, among other things, restrict our ability to successfully capitalize on\nour acquisition, merger, joint venture or investment;\n• adverse customer reaction to the business acquisition or combination;\n• increased liability and exposure to unforeseen contingencies and liabilities that we did not contemplate at the time\nof the merger, acquisition, strategic partnership or investment, including tax liabilities or claims by the counterparty\nor regulator related to the transaction, for which we may not have obtained contractual protections; and\n• a material impairment of our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize merger or\nacquisition expenses and merged or acquired assets.\nFor more information about our recent transactions, see Note 9—Significant Transactions to our Audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nFrom time to time, we may also seek to divest some of our businesses or assets, including divestitures of operations in\ncertain markets, infrastructure or tower assets or business lines. For example, on November 24, 2022, we announced the\ndivestment of our Russian Operations which was completed on October 9, 2023. For more information in relation to the sale of\nour Russian Operations, see —Information on the Company and Note 10—Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations of the\nAudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Such divestitures may take longer than anticipated or may not happen at all. If\nsimilar divestitures do not occur, close later than expected or do not deliver expected benefits, this may result in decreased cash\nproceeds and continued operations of non-core businesses that divert the attention of our management. Our success with any\ndivestiture is dependent on effectively and efficiently separating the divested asset or business and reducing or eliminating\nassociated overhead costs which may prove difficult or costly for us. There could also be transitional or business continuity risks\nor both associated with these divestitures that may impact our service levels and business targets. Furthermore, in some cases,\nwe may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses or assets. Failure to\nsuccessfully implement or complete a divestiture could also materially harm our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows or prospects.\n98\nWe face uncertainty regarding our frequency allocations and may experience limited spectrum capacity for providing wireless\nservices or be required to transfer our existing spectrum allocations, which would have a negative impact on our growth.\nWe are dependent on access to adequate frequency allocation within the right spectrum bands in each of our markets\nin order to provide mobile and fixed wireless telecommunications services on our networks, to maintain and expand our customer\nbase and provide a high-quality customer experience. However, the availability of spectrum is limited, closely regulated and can\nbe expensive, and we may not be able to obtain the frequency allocations we need from the relevant regulator or third party,\nwithout the imposition of burdensome service obligations or incurring commercially unreasonable costs, given that the interest\nfrom various parties frequently exceeds available spectrum.\nIn the past, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining adequate frequency allocation in some of the markets in which\nwe operate. For example, until March 2021, we held a disproportionately small amount of the available spectrum in Bangladesh\ngiven the size of our operations, and in 2022 we were unable to obtain frequency spectrum licenses for 5G in Kazakhstan\nthrough the auction process and future auctions or further options to obtain 5G spectrum may not be successful. In addition, we\nare also vulnerable to government actions, which may be unpredictable, that may impair our frequency allocations and infringe\nupon our spectrum, including existing spectrum. For example, the government of Uzbekistan ordered the equitable reallocation\namong all telecommunications providers in the market, which has affected approximately half of the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz\nradio frequencies of our Uzbek subsidiary, Unitel LLC, which came into effect in 2018. Frequency allocations may also be issued\nfor periods that are shorter than the terms of our licenses to provide telecommunications services in our countries of operation,\nand such allocations may not be renewed in a timely manner, or at all. In the event that we are unable to acquire or maintain\nsufficient frequency allocations in each of our countries of operations to support the growth of our customer base and products,\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may also be subject to increases in fee payments for frequency allocations under the terms of some of our licenses or to\nobtain new licenses.\nLegislation in most of the countries in which we operate, including Pakistan, requires that we make payments for\nfrequency spectrum usage. The fees for all available frequency assignments, as well as allotted frequency bands for different\nmobile communications technologies, are significant. For example, in Pakistan, the PTA issued a license renewal decision on\nJuly 22, 2019 requiring payment of an aggregate price of approximately US$450 million. The license renewal was signed under\nprotest on October 18, 2021 and payments of US$225 million, US$58 million, US$51.5 million, US$49.0 million, US$48.4\nmillion, US$50.0 million were made in September 2019, May 2020, May 2021 and May 2022, January 2023, and May 2024,\nrespectively. We have challenged the PTA license renewal decision before Pakistani courts. However, we await final resolution\nfrom the Supreme Court of Pakistan as the review petition against the decision remains pending which has not been fixed yet.\nAny significant increase in the fees payable for the frequencies that we use or for additional frequencies that we need\ncould have a negative effect on our financial results. We expect that the fees we pay for radio-frequency spectrum, including\nradio-frequency spectrum renewals, could substantially increase in some or all of the countries in which we operate, and any\nsuch increase could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nIf our frequency allocations are limited, we are unable to renew our frequency allocations or obtain new frequencies to\nallow us to provide mobile or fixed wireless services on a commercially feasible basis, our network capacity and our ability to\nprovide these services would be constrained and our ability to expand would be limited, which could harm our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nOur ability to profitably provide telecommunications services depends in part on the terms of our interconnection agreements and\naccess to third-party owned infrastructure and networks, over which we have no direct control.\nOur ability to provide high quality telecommunications services depends on our ability to secure and maintain\ninterconnection and roaming agreements with other mobile and fixed-line operators and access to infrastructure, networks and\nconnections that are owned or controlled by third parties and governments. Interconnection is required to complete calls that\noriginate on our respective networks but terminate outside our respective networks, or that originate from outside our respective\nnetworks and terminate on our respective networks. While we have interconnection agreements in place with other operators, we\ndo not have direct control over the quality of their networks and the interconnection and roaming services they provide. Outages,\ndisconnections or restrictions, including governmental, to access affecting these international connections can have a significant\nimpact on our ability to offer services and data connectivity to our customers. Any difficulties or delays in interconnecting with\nother networks and services, or the failure of any operator to provide reliable interconnection or roaming services to us on a\nconsistent basis, could result in a loss of customers or a decrease in traffic, which would reduce our revenues and harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. For more information on our interconnection\nagreements, see —Business Overview.\nSecuring these interconnection and roaming agreements and access on cost-effective terms is critical to the economic\nviability of our operations. Our countries of operation have a limited number of international cable connections providing access\nto internet, data service and call interconnection and such international connections may be controlled by national governments\nthat may seek to control or restrict access from time to time or impose conditions on pricing and availability which may impact our\naccess and the competitiveness of our pricing. In certain of the markets in which we operate, the relevant regulator sets MTRs,\nwhich are fees for access and interconnection that mobile operators charge for calls terminating on their respective networks. If\nany such regulator sets MTRs that are lower for us than the MTRs of our competitors, our interconnection costs may be higher\nand our interconnection revenues may be lower, relative to our competitors. Moreover, even in cases of equal MTRs on the\n99\nmarket for all players, the lowered MTR significantly impacts our revenue on a particular market. A significant increase in our\ninterconnection costs, or decrease in our interconnection rates, as a result of new regulations, commercial decisions by other\noperators, increased inflation rates in the countries in which we operate or a lack of available line capacity for interconnection\ncould harm our ability to provide services, which could in turn harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash\nflows or prospects.\nThe loss of important intellectual property rights, as well as third-party claims that we have infringed on their intellectual property\nrights, could significantly harm our business.\nWe regard our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, know-how and similar intellectual\nproperty, including our rights to certain domain names, as important to our continued success. For example, our widely\nrecognized logos, such as “VEON”, “Kyivstar” (Ukraine), “Jazz” (Pakistan), and “Banglalink” (Bangladesh), have played an\nimportant role in building brand awareness for our services and products. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret\nprotection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our\nproprietary rights. However, intellectual property rights are especially difficult to protect in many of the markets in which we\noperate. In these markets, the regulatory agencies charged to protect intellectual property rights are inadequately funded,\nlegislation is underdeveloped, piracy is commonplace and the enforcement of court decisions is difficult. We also face intellectual\nproperty risk with respect to our License Agreements with VimpelCom for the use of “Beeline” by certain of our operating\ncompanies. See — Our reputation could be adversely impacted by negative developments in respect of the Beeline brand\nfollowing the sale of our Russia Operations, which remains a trademark of our former subsidiary, VimpelCom (as defined below).\nIf we elect to undertake a rebranding exercise it may involve substantial costs and may not produce the intended benefits if it is\nnot favorably received by our existing and potential customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business\nrelationship.\nIn addition, as we continue our investment into a growing ecosystem of local digital services and execute our “digital\noperator 1440” strategy, we will need to ensure that we have adequate legal rights to the ownership or use of necessary source\ncode, content, and other intellectual property rights associated with our systems, products and services. For example, a number\nof platforms and digital services we offer are developed using source code created in conjunction with third parties. Even though\nwe rely on a combination of contractual provisions and intellectual property law to protect our proprietary technology and\nsoftware, access to and use of source code and other necessary intellectual property, third parties may still infringe or\nmisappropriate our intellectual property. We may be required to bring claims against third parties in order to protect our\nintellectual property rights, and we may not succeed in protecting such rights. As a result, we may not be able to use intellectual\nproperty that is material to the operation of our business.\nWe are in the process of registering, and maintaining and defending the registration of, the VEON name and logo as\ntrademarks in the jurisdictions in which we operate and other key territories, along with our other key trademarks and trade\nnames, logos and designs. As of June 30, 2024, we have achieved registration of the VEON name in 16 of the 17 jurisdictions\nsought (although only certain classes were sought in the European Union and the United Kingdom), with Bangladesh pending for\nall classes, except for class 41 for which we received provisional refusal, and we filed a response against the refusal on February\n1, 2024. With respect to the “V” Company logo, we have achieved registration in 17 of the 18 jurisdictions sought (although only\ncertain classes of registrations were sought in the European Union and Bermuda), with Bangladesh pending for all classes and\nEgypt pending only for one class. The timeline and process required to obtain trademark registration can vary widely between\njurisdictions.\nIn addition, as the number of convergent product offerings, such as JazzCash, Toffee and Tamasha, and overlapping\nproduct functions increase as we execute our “digital assets” and “digital operator” strategies, we need to ensure that such\nbrands and associated intellectual property are protected through trademark and copyright law in the same way as our legacy\nbrands and products. Furthermore, with the introduction of new product offerings, the possibility of intellectual property\ninfringement claims against us may correspondingly increase. For example, in the context of mobile entertainment producers and\ndistributors of content face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement and other claims based on the\nnature and content of materials, such as morality laws in Bangladesh and Pakistan. As we expand our digital services offerings,\nour ability to provide our customers with content depends on obtaining various rights from third parties on terms acceptable to us.\nCurrent and new intellectual property laws may affect our ability to protect our innovations and defend against third-\nparty claims of intellectual property rights infringement. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are\nlikely to increase in the future. Claims have been, or may be, threatened and/or filed against us for intellectual property\ninfringement based on the nature and content in our products and services, or content generated by our users. Any such claims\nor lawsuits, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, could cause us to cease\noffering or licensing services and products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, or could require us to develop\nnon-infringing products or services, if feasible, which could divert the attention and resources of our technical and management\npersonnel. We cannot assure you that we would prevail in any litigation related to infringement claims against us. A successful\nclaim of infringement against us could result in us incurring high costs, being required to pay significant damages, cease the\ndevelopment or sale of certain products and services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, obtain licenses from\nthe holders of such intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or otherwise redesign\nthose products to avoid infringing upon others’ intellectual property rights, any of which could harm our business and our ability to\ncompete.\n100\nRegulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks\nThe telecommunications industry is a highly regulated industry and we are subject to an extensive variety of laws and operate in\nuncertain judicial and regulatory environments, which may result in unanticipated outcomes that could harm our business.\nOur operations are subject to different and occasionally conflicting laws and regulations in each of and between the\njurisdictions in which we operate, which could result in market uncertainty and the lack of clear criteria. Regulatory compliance\nmay be costly and involve a significant expenditure of resources, thus negatively affecting our financial condition. In addition, any\nsignificant changes in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards, additional\nobligations or more stringent laws or regulations, could result in significant additional costs, including fines and penalties,\noperational burdens and other difficulties associated with not complying in a timely manner, or at all, with new or existing\nlegislation or the terms of any notices or warnings received from the telecommunications and other regulatory authorities. In\naddition, the application of the laws and regulations of any particular country is frequently unclear and may result in adverse\nrulings or audit findings by courts or government authorities resulting from a change in interpretation or inconsistent application of\nexisting law.\nOur operations may also be subject to regulatory audits in relation to prior compliance. For example, our operating\ncompany in Bangladesh has recently been subject to an extensive audit conducted by the BTRC concerning past compliance\nwith all relevant license terms, laws and regulations for the period covering 1996 (inception of our operating company in\nBangladesh) to December 2019. Competitor operators in the Bangladesh telecommunications industry have been subject to\nsimilar audits and have been fined. On June 26, 2023, the BTRC released its audit findings and issued a claim of BDT 8,231\nmillion (approximately US$74 million) which includes BDT 4,307 million (approximately US$39 million) for interest. Currently, the\nCompany is in the process of paying the principal amount in installments and in discussion with BTRC regarding removal of the\ninterest. Should Banglalink and the BTRC not be able to reach a mutually agreed position concerning the audit findings,\nprotracted litigation may result. The Company has accrued for amounts of the claim where it considers a cash outflow to be\nprobable.\nAs a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, these risks are compounded for our Ukrainian operations,\nas there is a risk that laws and regulations affecting telecommunications companies operating in those jurisdictions may be\nchanged dramatically and in ways that are adverse to our operations and results. For a further discussion on the ongoing war\nbetween Russia and Ukraine and its impact on our business, see —Market Risks—The ongoing war between Russia and\nUkraine is having, and will continue to have, an impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nprospects. For a discussion on the risks associated with operating in emerging markets, see —Market Risks—Investing in\nemerging markets, where our operations are located, is subject to greater risks than investing in more developed markets,\nincluding significant political, legal and economic risks.\nMobile, internet, fixed-line, voice, content and data markets generally are subject to extensive regulatory requirements,\nsuch as strict licensing regimes, antitrust and consumer protection regulations. Our ability to provide our mobile services is\ndependent on obtaining and maintaining the relevant licenses. These licenses are limited in time and subject to renewal. While\nwe are confident in our ability to obtain renewals upon request, we may not reliably predict the financial and other conditions at\nwhich such renewals will be granted. See— Regulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks—Our licenses are granted for specific\nperiods and may be suspended, revoked or we may be unable to extend or replace these licenses upon expiration and we may\nbe fined or penalized for alleged violations of law, regulations or license terms. In addition, regulations may be especially strict in\nthose countries in which we are considered to hold a significant market position (Ukraine, Pakistan and Uzbekistan) or a\ndominant market position (Kazakhstan). The applicable rules are generally subject to different interpretations and the relevant\nauthorities may challenge the positions that we take, resulting in unpredictable outcomes such as restrictions or delays in\nobtaining additional numbering capacity, receiving new licenses and frequencies, receiving regulatory approvals for rolling out\nour networks in the regions for which we have licenses, receiving regulatory approvals for the use of changes to our frequency,\nreceiving regulatory approvals of our tariffs plans and importing and certifying our equipment.\nAs we expand certain areas of our business and provide new services, such as DFS, banking, digital content, other\nnon-connectivity services, or value-added and internet-based services, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations. For\nmore on risks related to DFS, see —Regulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks—Our DFS offerings may increase our exposure to\nfraud, money laundering, reputational and regulatory risk.\nIn addition, certain regulations may require us to reduce retail prices, roaming prices or MTR and/or fixed-line\ntermination rates, require us to offer access to our network to other operators, or result in the imposition of fines if we fail to fulfill\nour service commitments. In some of our countries of operation, we are required to obtain approval for offers and advertising\ncampaigns, which can delay our marketing campaigns and require restructuring of business initiatives. We may also be required\nto obtain approvals for certain acquisitions, reorganizations or other transactions, and failure to obtain such approvals may\nimpede or harm our business and our ability to adjust our operations or acquire or divest of businesses or assets. Laws and\nregulations in some jurisdictions oblige us to install surveillance, interception and data retention equipment to ensure that our\nnetworks are capable of allowing the government to monitor data and voice traffic on our networks. Violation of these laws by an\noperator may result in fines, suspension of activities or license revocation. The nature of our business also subjects us to certain\nregulations regarding open internet access or net neutrality.\nRegulatory requirements and compliance with such regulations may be costly and involve a significant expenditure of\nresources, which could impact our business operations and may affect our financial performance. We face regulatory risks and\ncosts in each of the markets in which we operate and may be subject to additional regulations in future. In particular, our ability to\n101\ncompete effectively in existing or new markets could be adversely affected if regulators decide to expand the restrictions and\nobligations to which we are subject, or extend such restrictions and obligations to new services and markets, or otherwise\nwithdraw or adopt regulations, which may cause delays in implementing our strategies and business plans and create a more\nchallenging operating environment. Furthermore, our ability to introduce new products and services may also be affected if we do\nnot accurately predict how existing or future laws, regulations or policies would apply to such products and services, which could\nprevent us from realizing a return on our investment in their development. Any failure on our part to comply with existing or new\nlaws and regulations can result in negative publicity, the risk of prosecution or the suspension or loss of our licenses, frequency\nallocations, authorizations or various permissions, diversion of management time and effort, increased competitive and pricing\npressure on our operations, significant fines and liabilities, third party civil claims, and other penalties or otherwise harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nViolations of and changes to applicable sanctions and embargo laws, including export control restrictions, may harm our\nbusiness.\nVarious governmental authorities have imposed significant penalties on companies that fail to comply with the\nrequirements of applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, as well as export control restrictions. Where applicable\nto our activities, we must comply with sanctions and embargo laws and regulations and export control restrictions of the United\nStates, the United Nations, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those\nthat have been imposed in response to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Sanctions and embargo and export\ncontrol laws and regulations generally establish the scope of their own application, which arise for different reasons and can vary\ngreatly by jurisdiction.\nThe scope of such laws and regulations may be expanded, sometimes without notice, in a manner that could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. For example, in the United\nStates, Congress enacted the Export Controls Act of 2018 which aims to enhance protection of U.S. technology resources by\nimposing greater restrictions on the transfer to non-U.S. individuals and companies, particularly through exports to China, of\ncertain key foundational and emerging technologies and cyber-security considered critical to U.S. national security. In recent\nyears, the Department of Commerce has also broadened the scope of U.S. export controls measures to protect a wider range of\nnational security interests, including telecommunications technology, against perceived challenges presented by China, and has\nintroduced heightened export restrictions targeting parties identified as military end-users and military intelligence end-users,\nincluding parties in China. This has had an effect on our ability to procure certain supplies for our business and transact with\ncertain business partners. In response to these developments, countries, such as China, have also adopted sanctions\ncountermeasures that may impact our future ability to ensure our suppliers’ compliance with these laws.\nAlthough our common shares traded on MOEX are currently subject to delisting pursuant Russian regulations, our\nunsponsored listing on MOEX also exposes us to increased risk that designated individuals and entities may buy, sell or\notherwise transact with VEON Ltd.’s shares, as certain brokers do not have policies against providing services to designated\nindividuals or entities. In the event that such designated individuals or entities buy, sell or otherwise transact with VEON Ltd.’s\nshares, this could cause reputational harm to us, particularly if they were significant shareholders, and we would expect to be\nable to have limited ability to engage with any such shareholders. See —Market Risks— We have suffered reputational harm as\na result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed for a discussion of how exposure to\ndesignated individuals at the shareholder level exposes us to risk.\nNotwithstanding our policies and compliance controls, we may be found in the future to be in violation of applicable sanctions\nand embargo laws, particularly as the scope of such laws, including those recently imposed following the Russia-Ukraine war,\nmay be unclear and subject to discretionary interpretations by regulators, which may change over time. If we fail to comply with\napplicable sanctions or embargo laws and regulations, we could suffer severe operational, financial or reputational\nconsequences. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements include representations and covenants requiring compliance\nwith or limitation of activities under sanctions and embargo laws and regulations of certain additional jurisdictions, the breach of\nwhich may trigger defaults or cross-defaults of mandatory prepayment requirements in the event of a breach thereof. For a\ndiscussion of risks related to export and re-export restrictions, see—Operational Risks—We depend on third parties for certain\nservices and equipment, infrastructure and other products important to our business.\nWe could be subject to tax claims and repeated tax audits that could harm our business.\nTax declarations together with related documentation are subject to review and investigation by a number of authorities\nin many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which are empowered to impose fines and penalties on taxpayers. Tax audits\nmay result in additional costs to our group if the relevant tax authorities conclude that an entity of our group did not satisfy their\nrelevant tax obligations in any given year. Such audits may also impose additional burdens on us by diverting the attention of\nmanagement resources.\nTax audits in the countries in which we operate are conducted regularly, but their outcomes may not be fair or\npredictable. In the past and currently, we have been subject to substantial claims by tax authorities in Egypt, Italy, Belgium,\nPakistan, Bangladesh, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. These claims have resulted, and future claims may\nresult, in additional payments, including interest, fines and other penalties, to the tax authorities.\nThere can be no assurance that we will prevail in litigation with tax authorities and that the tax authorities will not claim\nthe additional taxes, interest, fines and other penalties that are owed by us for prior or future tax years, or that the relevant\ngovernmental authorities will not decide to initiate a criminal investigation or prosecution, or expand existing criminal\n102\ninvestigations or prosecutions, in connection with claims by tax inspectorates, including those relating to individual employees\nand for prior tax years. We have been the subject of repeated complex and thematic tax audits in Italy, Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan,\nwhich, in some instances, have resulted in payments made under protest pending legal challenges and/or to avoid the initiation\nor continuation of associated criminal proceedings. The outcome of these audits or the adverse or delayed resolution of other tax\nmatters, including where the relevant tax authorities may conclude that we had significantly underpaid taxes relating to earlier\nperiods, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nFor more information regarding tax claims and tax provisions and liabilities and their effects on our financial statements,\nsee Note 7 —Provisions and Contingent Liabilities and Note 8 —Income Taxes, respectively of our Audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nChanges in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations, including our determination of the recognition and recoverability of deferred\ntax assets, could harm our business, and the unpredictable tax systems and our performance in the markets in which we operate\ngive rise to significant uncertainties and risks that could complicate our tax and business decisions.\nThe introduction of new tax laws or the amendment of existing tax laws, such as those relating to transfer pricing rules\nor the deduction of interest expenses in the markets in which we operate, may also increase the risk of adjustments being made\nby the tax authorities and, as a result, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows or prospects. For example, within the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n(“OECD”) there is an initiative aimed at avoiding base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) for tax purposes. This OECD BEPS\nproject has resulted in further developments in other countries and in particular in the European Union.\nFor example, the OECD Pillar Two (“Pillar Two”) legislation has been substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions\nwhere the Group operates. The legislation will be effective for the Group’s financial year beginning January 1, 2024. The Group\nis in scope of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation and has performed an assessment of the Group’s potential\nexposure to Pillar Two income taxes. It is based on the most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting and financial\nstatements for the constituent entities of the Group. Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the\njurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15%. However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the\ntransitional safe harbor relief does not apply and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to 15%. The Group does not expect a\nmaterial exposure to Pillar Two income taxes in those jurisdictions.\nOur business decisions take into account certain taxation scenarios, which could be proven to be untrue in the event of\nadverse decisions by tax authorities or changes in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations. For example, we are vulnerable to\nchanges in tax laws, regulations and interpretations in the Netherlands, our current resident state for tax purposes.\nThese considerations are compounded by the fact that the interpretation and enforcement of tax laws in the emerging\nmarkets in which we operate tends to be unpredictable and give rise to significant uncertainties, which could complicate our\nbusiness decisions. Any additional tax liability imposed on us by tax authorities in this manner, as well as any unforeseen\nchanges in applicable tax laws or changes in the tax authorities’ interpretations of the respective double tax treaties in effect,\ncould harm our future results of operations, cash flows or the amounts of dividends available for distribution to shareholders in a\nparticular period. Considerable judgment is therefore required by our management to determine whether it is probable that an\nuncertain income tax position will not be sustained and to estimate the amounts in the range of most likely outcomes. Judgment\nis also required by management in determining the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome for non-income tax claims\nand to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Due to these uncertainties and challenges, we may be required to\naccrue substantial amounts for contingent tax liabilities and the amounts accrued for tax contingencies may not be sufficient to\nmeet any liability we may ultimately face. From time to time, we may also identify tax contingencies for which we have not\nrecorded an accrual. Such unaccrued tax contingencies could materialize and require us to pay additional amounts of tax. See\nNote 7—Provisions and Contingent Liabilities and Note 8—Income Taxes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for\nfurther detail.\nFurthermore, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets based on whether management estimates that it is probable\nthat there will be sufficient taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group to allow the recognized assets to be recovered,\nwhich requires significant judgment.\nThe Company recognized deferred tax assets for losses carried forward for $286 million, of which $134 million relate to\ndeferred tax assets in Bangladesh as of December 31, 2023. The recognition of these deferred tax assets is contingent upon our\nability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these temporary differences and carryforwards before they expire.\nSeveral factors could adversely affect our ability to realize the benefits of deferred tax assets:\n• adverse economic conditions could negatively impact our profitability and, consequently, our ability to generate taxable\nincome, which could hinder our ability to utilize deferred tax assets within the allowable time frame;\n• future changes in tax laws or regulations, including changes in tax rates, could impact the value of our deferred tax\nassets, reducing reduce or eliminating the benefits associated with our deferred tax assets;\n• our ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our operational performance; if we fail to achieve our projected\nearnings or if our business operations do not perform as expected, we may not generate sufficient taxable income to\nutilize our deferred tax assets;\n• decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or other strategic initiatives could affect our ability to utilize\ndeferred tax assets; for example, changes in our business structure or the sale of certain assets could impact the timing\nand amount of taxable income;\n103\n• we periodically assess the need for valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more\nlikely than not that some or all of these assets will not be realized, we may need to establish or increase valuation\nallowances, which would result in a charge to our earnings.\nGiven these uncertainties, there is a risk that we may not be able to fully realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets within the\nallowable timeframe, which could impact our profitability.\nThe tax laws and regulations in our jurisdictions of operation are complex and subject to varying interpretations and\ndegrees of enforcement, and we cannot be sure that our interpretations are accurate or that the responsible tax authority agrees\nwith our views. If our tax positions are challenged by the tax authorities or if there are any unforeseen changes in applicable tax\nlaws and interest, if applicable, we could incur additional tax liabilities, which could increase our costs of operations and harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nLaws restricting foreign investment could materially harm our business.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of jurisdictions have introduced rules restricting foreign investment or have\nstrengthened existing rules, and our business could be materially harmed by such new or existing laws. For example, there is a\nlaw restricting foreign investment in Kazakhstan. The national security law of Kazakhstan states that a foreign company or\nindividual cannot directly or indirectly own more than a 49% stake in an entity that carries out long-distance or international\ntelecommunications or owns fixed communication lines, without the consent of the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation\nand Aerospace Industry and national security authorities in Kazakhstan. While this regulation does not currently apply to KaR-\nTel, our mobile telecommunications subsidiary in Kazakhstan, it did apply to TNS+ (a Kazakh wholesale telecommunications\ninfrastructure services provider) in which the Company held a 49% stake until the closing of the sale of TNS+ to DAR group of\ncompanies on September 30, 2024. For more information, see Exhibit 99.2—Regulation of Telecommunications—Regulation of\nTelecommunications in Kazakhstan. The existence of such laws that restrict foreign investment could hinder potential business\ncombinations or transactions resulting in a change of control, or our ability to obtain financing from foreign investors should prior\nregulatory approval be refused, delayed or require foreign investors to comply with certain conditions, which could materially\nharm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nNew or proposed changes to laws or new interpretations of existing laws in the markets in which we operate may harm our\nbusiness.\nAs a telecommunications operator, with DFS, banking, digital content, digital health, AdTech and other non-connectivity\nofferings, we are subject to a variety of national and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. These\nlaws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business. Violations of applicable laws or regulations could damage our\nreputation or result in regulatory or private actions with substantial penalties or damages, including the revocation of some of our\nlicenses. In addition, any significant changes in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher\nstandards, additional obligations or more stringent laws or regulations, including revision in regulations for license and frequency\nallocation and changes in foreign policy or trade restrictions and regulations (including in all respects in Ukraine as a\nconsequence of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine) could have an adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nFor example, in some of the markets in which we operate, SIM verification and re-verification initiatives have been\nimplemented, which could result in the loss of some of our customer base in a particular market. In addition to customer losses,\nsuch requirements can result in claims from legitimate customers who are incorrectly blocked, fined, have their license\nsuspended and other liabilities arising from the failure to comply with the requirements. To the extent re-verification and/or new\nverification requirements are imposed in the jurisdictions in which we operate, it could have an adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, many jurisdictions in which we operate have seen the\nadoption of data localization and data protection laws that prohibit the collection and/or processing of certain personal data\nthrough servers located outside of the respective jurisdictions.\nIn some jurisdictions in which we operate legislation is being implemented to extend data protection laws. For example,\nin Kazakhstan the government has commenced consultation on data protection measures to increase regulation over the\nrecollection and processing of personal data, with the latest amendment that allows government authorities to inspect the\npractices of personal data operators being adopted in December 2023. In Pakistan, there is no specific statute in place to\nregulate the processing and transmitting of personal data and instead, relevant laws are scattered throughout various statutes,\nrules and regulations, with a bill regarding personal data protection in the consultation stages of Parliament. Should such bill be\npromulgated into official legislation, additional obligations could be placed on our data management operations in Pakistan. For\na discussion of certain regulatory developments and trends and their impact on our business, see —Regulation of\nTelecommunications.\nWe may not be able to detect and prevent fraud or other misconduct by our employees, joint venture partners, non-controlled\nsubsidiaries, representatives, agents, suppliers, customers or other third parties.\nWe have in the past and may in the future be exposed to fraud or other misconduct committed by our employees, joint\nventure partners, non-controlled subsidiaries, representatives, agents, suppliers, customers or other third parties undertaking\n104\nactions on our behalf that could subject us to litigation, financial losses and fines, penalties or criminal charges imposed by\ngovernmental authorities, and affect our reputation.\nSuch misconduct has in the past included, or may in the future include misappropriating funds, conducting transactions\nthat are outside of authorized limits, engaging in misrepresentation or fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise improper activities,\nincluding activities in exchange for personal benefit or gain, or activities that otherwise do not comply with applicable laws or our\ninternal policies and procedures. The risk of fraud or other misconduct could increase as we expand certain areas of our\nbusiness. See—Regulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks—Our DFS offerings may increase our exposure to fraud, money\nlaundering, reputational and regulatory risk below for further discussion of this increased risk.\nIn addition to any potential legal and financial liability, our reputation may also be adversely impacted by association,\naction or inaction that is either real or perceived by stakeholders or customers to be inappropriate or unethical. Reputational risk\nmay arise in many different ways, including, but not limited to any real or perceived:\n• failure to act in good faith and in accordance with our values, Code of Conduct, other policies, procedures, and\ninternal standards;\n• failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or association, real or perceived, with illegal activity;\n• failure in corporate governance, management or systems;\n• association with controversial practices, customers, transactions, projects, countries or governments or other third\nparties;\n• association with controversial business decisions, including but not limited to those relating to existing or new\nproducts, delivery channels, promotions/advertising, acquisitions, representations, sourcing/supply chain\nrelationships, locations, or treatment of financial transactions; or\n• association with poor employment or human rights practices.\nWe regularly review and update our policies and procedures and internal controls, which are designed to provide\nreasonable assurance that we and our personnel comply with applicable laws and our internal policies. We have also issued a\nBusiness Partner Code of Conduct that we expect our representatives, agents, suppliers and other third parties to follow and\nconduct risk-based training for our personnel. However, there can be no assurance that such policies, procedures, internal\ncontrols and training will, at all times, prevent or detect misconduct and protect us from liability arising from actions of our\nemployees, joint ventures partners, non-controlled subsidiaries, representatives, agents, suppliers, customers or other third\nparties.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in multiple jurisdictions.\nWe operate in countries which pose elevated risks of corruption and are subject to a number of anti-corruption laws,\nincluding the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act, the anti-corruption provisions of the Dutch Criminal Code in the Netherlands and local\nlaws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. An investigation into allegations of non-compliance or a finding of non-compliance\nwith anti-corruption laws or other laws governing the conduct of business may subject us to administrative and other financial\ncosts, reputational damage, criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, which could harm our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their\nintermediaries from promising, offering or giving a financial or other things of value or advantage to someone for the purpose of\nimproperly influencing a matter or obtaining or retaining business or rewarding improper conduct. The FCPA further requires\nissuers, including foreign issuers with securities registered on a U.S. stock exchange, to maintain accurate books and records\nand a system of sufficient internal controls. We regularly review and update our policies and procedures and internal controls to\nprovide reasonable assurance that we and our personnel comply with the applicable anti-corruption laws, although we cannot\nguarantee that these efforts will be successful.\nWe maintain a Business Partner Code of Conduct and attempt to obtain assurances from distributors and other\nintermediaries, through contractual and other legal obligations, that they also will comply with anti-corruption laws applicable to\nthem and to us. However, these efforts to secure legal commitments are not always successful. There are inherent limitations to\nthe effectiveness of any policies, procedures and internal controls, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention\nor overriding of the policies, procedures and internal controls. There can be no assurance that such policies or procedures or\ninternal controls will work effectively at all times or protect us against liability under anti-corruption or other laws for actions taken\nby our personnel, distributors and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. Our\nBusiness Partner Code of Conduct is available on our website at http://www.veon.com.\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) that VEON entered into with the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice on February 18, 2016 has concluded and the criminal charges that had been deferred by the DPA have\nbeen dismissed. Since concluding the DPA, we have provided, and may in the future provide, updates on certain internal\ninvestigations related to potential misconduct to the U.S. authorities. In the event that any of these matters lead to governmental\ninvestigations or proceedings, it could lead to reputational harm and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, cash flows or prospects.\n105\nOur DFS offerings may increase our exposure to fraud, money laundering, reputational and regulatory risk.\nOur DFS offerings are subject to regulatory requirements which are different from the traditional regulatory requirements\nof a telecommunications business. They may involve cash handling or other value transfers, exposing us to the risk that our\ncustomers or business partners may engage in fraudulent activities, money laundering or terrorism financing. Violations of anti-\nmoney laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws, know-your-customer rules, and customer name screening and monitoring\nrequirements or other regulations applicable to our DFS offering could result in legal and financial liability or reputational damage\nand harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. The regulations governing these\nservices are evolving and, as they develop, regulations could become more onerous, impose additional controls, reporting or\ndisclosure obligations, or limit our flexibility to rapidly deploy new products, which may limit our ability to provide our services\nefficiently or in the way originally envisioned. In addition, as we seek to execute our “digital operator 1440”, we may seek to\nexpand our DFS offerings, thereby increasing our exposure to such risks.\nFor example, Mobilink Bank in Pakistan carries on a microfinance banking business and provides certain DFS (some\nprovided in conjunction with Jazz through JazzCash) and traditional banking services in Pakistan under a license that was\ngranted by the State Bank of Pakistan and is subject to regulation by the State Bank of Pakistan. Such regulations and banking\nlaws are subject to change from time to time, including with respect to capitalization requirements and we may be required to\nincrease the capitalization of Mobilink Bank from time to time and may be required to inject funds to cover any losses that the\nbank suffers. Due to the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in Pakistan (which could adversely impact Mobilink Bank’s\nloan and deposit portfolio), coupled with a stress on capital adequacy ratio rate of 16.2% as of December 31, 2023 and 15.58%\nas of June 30, 2024, as against the regulatory requirement of 15%, Mobilink may face challenges in meeting its capital adequacy\nratio in the coming months. Should Mobilink Bank fail to meet the required capital adequacy ratio, it may need to reduce or halt\ncertain lending activities until it can meet its capital adequacy ratio requirement, which would result in a loss of revenue, and any\nfailure to meet its capital adequacy ratio could lead to reputational damage to Mobilink Bank and loss of customer confidence in\nit. In addition, Mobilink Bank’s activities may expose us to a risk of liability under banking and financial services compliance laws,\nincluding, for example, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations.\nIn addition, because our DFS offering requires us to process personal data (such as, consumer names, addresses,\ncredit and debit card numbers and bank account details), we must comply with strict data protection and consumer protection\nlaws. For more information on the risks associated with possible unauthorized disclosure of such personal data, see—\nRegulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks—We collect and process sensitive personal data, and are therefore subject to an\nincreasing number of data privacy laws and regulations that may require us to incur substantial costs and implement certain\nchanges to our business practices that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur DFS business also requires us to maintain availability of our systems and platforms, and failure to maintain agreed\nlevels of service availability or to reliably process our customers’ transactions due to performance, administrative or technical\nissues, system interruptions or other failures could result in a loss of revenue, violation of certain local banking regulations,\npayment of contractual or consequential damages, reputational harm, additional operating expenses to remediate any failures, or\nexposure to other losses and liabilities.\nWe collect and process sensitive personal data, and are therefore subject to an increasing number of data privacy laws and\nregulations that may require us to incur substantial costs and implement certain changes to our business practices that may\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various, and at times conflicting, data privacy laws and regulations that apply to the collection, use,\nstorage, disclosure and security of personal data which is generally understood to be any data or information that identifies or\nmay be used to identify an individual, including names and contact information, IP addresses, (e-mail) correspondence, call\ndetail records and browsing history. Many countries have additional laws that regulate the processing, retention and use of\ncommunications data (including both content and metadata), as well as health data and certain other forms of personal data\nwhich have been designated as being particularly sensitive. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and\ndiffering interpretations and are, in certain jurisdictions, becoming more stringent over time.\nIn certain jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to other data protection laws and regulations that establish\ndifferent categories of information such as state secrets and personal data of our customers, which have different registration\nand permitted disclosure rules and require different corresponding levels of protection and safeguards. In each case, we are\nrequired to implement the appropriate level of data protection measures and cooperate with government authorities with regards\nto law enforcement disclosures for state secrets and personal data of our customers. In our operating jurisdictions, new laws and\nregulations may be introduced subjecting us to more rigorous and stringent data protection or privacy requirements which may\nresult in increased compliance costs and business risks or increased risk of liability and exposure to regulatory fines and\nsanctions. In addition, in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) has an extraterritorial effect\nfurther to Article 3(2) GDPR and may therefore apply outside of the European Union. The absence of an establishment in the\nEuropean Union does not necessarily mean that processing activities by a data controller or processor established in a third\ncountry will be excluded from the scope of the GDPR. While the processing of personal data by a limited number of our entities,\nincluding our Amsterdam office and central operating entities within the European Union are subject to the EU GDPR, our\noperations in other markets, such as Ukraine, may also become subject to the GDPR considering the extraterritorial effect of this\nlegislation. For example, if such operations involve the offering of goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of, individuals\nin the European Union.\n106\nMany of the jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that restrict cross border data transfers unless certain criteria\nare met and/or are developing or implementing data localization laws requiring that certain types of data be stored locally. These\nlaws may restrict our flexibility to leverage our data and build new, or consolidate existing, technologies, databases and IT\nsystems, limit our ability to use and share personal data, cause us to incur costs (including those related to storing data in\nmultiple jurisdictions), require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business or conflict with other\nlaws to which we are subject, thereby exposing us to regulatory risk. The stringent cross-border transfer rules in certain\njurisdictions may also prohibit us from disclosing data to foreign authorities upon their request, which may generate a scenario\nwhere it is not possible for us to comply with both laws. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order\nrequiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the laws and regulations regarding data privacy may become more stringent over time. For example, the\nEuropean Commission has also proposed a draft of the new ePrivacy Regulation on January 10, 2017, which was intended to\nreplace the 2022/58 e-Privacy Directive. As of August 2024, the current draft of the ePrivacy Regulation is still going through the\nEU legislative process. When it comes into effect, it is expected to regulate the processing of electronic communications data\ncarried out in connection with the provision and the use of publicly available electronic communications services to users in the\nEuropean Union, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place in the European Union. Unlike the current ePrivacy\nDirective, the draft ePrivacy Regulation will likely apply to Over the Top (“OTT”) service providers as well as traditional\ntelecommunications service providers (including the requirements on data retention and interception and changes to restrictions\non the use of traffic and location data). Our entities established in the European Union which process such electronic\ncommunications data are likely to be subject to this regime. The current draft of the ePrivacy Regulation also regulates the\nretention and interception of communications data as well as the use of location and traffic data for value added services,\nimposes stricter requirements on electronic marketing, and changes to the requirements for use of tracking technologies, such as\ncookies. This could broaden the exposure of our business lines based in the European Union to data protection liability, restrict\nour ability to leverage our data and increase the costs of running those businesses. The draft law also significantly increases\npenalties for non-compliance with fines of up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s global annual revenue, whichever is higher, for\nserious violations under the current draft. For a discussion of other telecommunications related data protection related laws and\nregulations that affect our business, see Exhibit 99.2—Regulation of Telecommunications.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry\nstandards may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations, blockage or limitation of our services, fines and\npenalties. In general, mobile operators are directly liable for actions of third parties to whom they forward personal data for\nprocessing. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security breach, such\nviolations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and/or could in turn harm our business.\nIn addition, concerns regarding our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal data or other\nprivacy-related matters could result in negative publicity and have an adverse effect on our reputation. Violation of these data\nprotection laws and regulations may lead to a seizure of our database and equipment, imposition of administrative sanctions\n(including in the form of fines, suspension of activities or revocation of license) or result in a ban on the processing of personal\ndata, which, in turn, could lead to the inability to provide services to our customers. The occurrence of any of the aforementioned\nevents, individually or in the aggregate, could harm our brand, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or\nprospects.\nWe are, and may in the future be, involved in, associated with, or otherwise subject to legal liability in connection with disputes\nand litigation with regulators, competitors and third parties, which when concluded, could harm our business.\nWe are party to a number of lawsuits and other legal, regulatory or antitrust proceedings and commercial disputes, the\nfinal outcomes of which are uncertain and inherently unpredictable. We may also be subject to claims concerning certain third-\nparty products, services or content we provide by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting or providing\naccess to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to, these products, services or content. In\naddition, we currently host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to engage in various online\nactivities. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for the activities of their users is still\nunsettled in some jurisdictions. Claims may be threatened or brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of\ncontract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, tort, including personal injury, fraud or other grounds based on\nthe nature and content of information that we use and store. In addition, we may be subject to domestic or international actions\nalleging that certain content we have generated, user-generated content or third-party content that we have made available\nwithin our services violates applicable law.\nAny such disputes or legal proceedings, whether with or without merit, could be expensive and time consuming, and\ncould divert the attention of our senior management. Any adverse outcome in these or other proceedings, including any that may\nbe asserted in the future, could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows or prospects. We cannot assure you what the ultimate outcome of any particular dispute or legal\nproceeding will be. For more information on current disputes, see Note 7—Provisions and Contingent Liabilities to our Audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nOur licenses are granted for specific periods and may be suspended, revoked or we may be unable to extend or replace these\nlicenses upon expiration and we may be fined or penalized for alleged violations of law, regulations or license terms.\nThe success of our operations is dependent on the maintenance of our licenses to provide telecommunications services\nin the jurisdictions in which we operate. Most of our licenses are granted for specified terms, and there can be no assurance that\n107\nany license will be renewed upon expiration. Some of our licenses will expire in the near term. For more information about our\nlicenses, including their expiration dates, see —Business Overview. These licenses and the frameworks governing their\nrenewals are subject to ongoing review by the relevant regulatory authorities. If renewed, our licenses may contain additional\nobligations, including payment obligations (which may involve a substantial renewal or extension fee), or may cover reduced\nservice areas or scope of service. Furthermore, the governments in certain jurisdictions in which we operate may hold auctions\n(including auctions of spectrum for the 4G/LTE or more advanced services, such as 5G) in the future. If we are unable to\nmaintain or obtain licenses for the provision of telecommunications services or more advanced services, or if our licenses are not\nrenewed or are renewed on less favorable terms, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. We are\nrequired to meet certain terms and conditions under our licenses (such as nationwide coverage, quality of service parameters\nand capital expenditure, including network build-out requirements), including meeting certain conditions established by the\nlegislation regulating the communications industry. From time to time, we may be in breach of such terms and conditions. If we\nfail to comply with the conditions of our licenses or with the requirements established by the legislation regulating the\ncommunications industry, or if we do not obtain or comply with permits for the operation of our equipment, use of frequencies or\nadditional licenses for broadcasting directly or through agreements with broadcasting companies, the applicable regulator could\ndecide to levy fines, suspend, terminate or refuse to renew the license or permit. Such regulatory actions could adversely impact\nour ability to continue operating our business in the current or planned manner or to carry out divestitures in the relevant\njurisdictions.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our ability to build out our networks in accordance with our\nplans, our ability to retain and attract customers, our reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash\nflows or prospects. For more information on our licenses and their related requirements, see —Business Overview. For a\ndiscussion of the risks related to operating in emerging markets, see —Market Risks—Investing in emerging markets, where our\noperations are located, is subject to greater risks than investing in more developed markets, including significant political, legal\nand economic risks.\nIt may not be possible for us to procure in a timely manner, or at all, the permissions and registrations required for our base\nstations.\nOur mobile network is supported by numerous base station transmission systems. Given the multitude of regulations\nthat govern such equipment and the various permits required to operate our base stations, it is frequently not possible for us to\nprocure in a timely manner, or at all, the permissions and registrations required for our base stations, including construction\npermits and registration of our title to land plots underlying our base stations, or to amend or maintain the permissions in a timely\nmanner when it is necessary to change the location or technical specifications of our base stations. For a discussion of the risks\nassociated with the export controls that could impact our ability to update and maintain our equipment and infrastructure, see —\nOperational Risks—We depend on third parties for certain services and equipment, infrastructure and other products important to\nour business. As a result, there could be a number of base stations or other communications facilities and other aspects of our\nnetworks for which we are awaiting final permission to operate for indeterminate periods.\nWe also regularly receive notices from regulatory authorities in countries in which we operate, warning us that we are\nnot in compliance with aspects of our licenses and permits and requiring us to cure the violations within a certain time period. In\nthe past, we have closed base stations on several occasions in order to comply with regulations and notices from regulatory\nauthorities. Any failure by our company to cure such violations could result in the applicable license being suspended and\nsubsequently revoked through court action. Although we look to take all necessary steps to comply with any license violations\nwithin the stated time periods, including by switching off base stations that do not have all necessary permits until such permits\nare obtained, we cannot assure you that our licenses or permits will not be suspended or revoked in the future.\nIf we are found to operate telecommunications equipment without an applicable license or permit, we could experience\na significant disruption in our service or network operation, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows or prospects.\nOur Egyptian holding company may expose us to legal and political risk and reputational harm.\nOur subsidiary in Egypt, Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. (“GTH”), is an Egyptian private company and is subject to\ncorresponding laws and regulations. Although GTH is no longer operating any business activities and GTH entered into a tax\nsettlement agreement with the Egyptian tax authorities for certain historic periods, GTH may in the future be subject to further\nunmerited or unfounded tax claims for other tax periods under existing or new Egyptian tax law or upon winding up or liquidation.\nThe winding up of GTH and its subsidiaries may take some time and may expose the Company to additional costs and expenses\nor liabilities. In particular, GTH still has a large number of private investors holding less than 0.5% of GTH’s share capital and\nthey may subject VEON Ltd. or GTH to claims in the future and may delay the winding up or liquidation of GTH.\nRegulatory developments and government action on climate change issues may drive medium-to-long term increases in our\noperational costs.\nOur business operations and financial condition are subject to regulatory developments and government action on\nclimate change. Governments across the world are responding to climate change by adopting ambitious climate policies as\npublic awareness of and concern about climate change continues to grow. Government climate policies include the enactment of\ncircular economy regulations, regulating greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, carbon pricing and increasing energy and fuel\ncosts. Increased fuel and energy prices and taxes and pricing of GHG emissions could make it more expensive for us to power\nour networks and operations, and may also result in VEON being subject to carbon emission taxation directly for our limited\n108\ncarbon emissions as a telecommunications operator, which would drive medium-to-long term increases in our operational costs.\nIn addition, there are initial capital costs that we will have to incur as we transition towards the use of renewable energy across\nour operations.\nThere could also be increases in our operational costs due to changing levels of precipitation, increased severity and\nfrequency of storms and other weather events, extreme temperatures and rising sea levels, which could cause potential damage\nto vital infrastructure and utilities. Increased risk of flooding to low-lying facilities and infrastructure due to longer-term increases\nin precipitation patterns could increase operating costs to maintain and/or repair facilities and network equipment. Decreased\nprecipitation and rising and extreme temperatures could generate drought conditions that could create an increased burden to\nlocal power and water resources, which are required to operate our cooling infrastructure. In addition, these climate change\nimpacts could also result in drops in productivity or increased operational costs for our suppliers, which in turn may be passed on\nto us, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAdoption of new accounting standards and regulatory reviews could affect reported results and financial position.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of\noperations. Accounting standard-setting bodies, including the International Accounting Standards Board, may change accounting\nregulations that govern the preparation and presentation of our financial statements, and those who interpret the accounting\nstandards, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Dutch Authority for the Financial\nMarkets (the “AFM”) may amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various accounting standards\nshould be applied. Those changes may be difficult to predict and could have a significant impact on the way we account for\ncertain operations and present our financial position and operating income. In some instances, a modified standard or\ninterpretation thereof, an outcome from a unfavorable regulatory review relating to our financial reporting or new requirement\nmay have to be implemented with retrospective effect, which requires us to restate or make other changes to our previously\nissued financial statements and other financial information issued and such circumstances may involve the identification of one\nor more significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or may otherwise impact\nhow we prepare and report our financial statements, and may impact future financial covenants in our financing documents. For\nexample, we were engaged in a comment letter process with the AFM regarding our financial statements as of and for the six\nand three-month periods ended June 30, 2020 in which the AFM indicated that our goodwill impairment tests may have been\napplied incorrectly and that an additional goodwill impairment charge may be necessary, which concluded in December 2021.\nWhile the outcome of this particular process did not require us to restate previously issued financial statements or result in other\nchanges to our goodwill impairment testing being imposed, there can be no assurance that the AFM will not raise new comments\non our financial statements in the future that will be resolved without adverse consequences.\nFor more information on the impact of IFRS on our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and on the\nimplementation of new standards and interpretations issued, see Note 24—Significant Accounting Policies to our Audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters Although we consider our relations\nwith our employees to be generally good, there can be no assurance that our operations will not be impacted by unionization\nefforts, strikes or other types of labor disputes or disruptions. For instance, employee dissatisfaction or labor disputes could\nresult from the implementation of cost savings initiatives or redundancies in our offices. We could also experience strikes or other\nlabor disputes or disruptions in connection with social unrest or political events. For a discussion of our employees represented\nby works councils, unions or collective bargaining agreements, see —Employees.\nWork stoppages could also occur due to natural disasters, civil unrest (including potential dissatisfaction with regards to\nour response to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine) or security breaches/threats, such as due to the ongoing war\nbetween Russia and Ukraine, which would make access to work places and management of our systems difficult and may mean\nthat we are not able to timely or cost effectively meet the demands of our customers. In Ukraine, we may experience work\nperturbation and deficiencies due to loss of key personnel to mobilization efforts in connection with the war and migration outside\nof Ukraine which may affect the quality of service delivery and timeliness of service restoration in connection with our Ukrainian\noperations. Furthermore, work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in lower\ndemand for our services and products. In the event that we, or one or more of our customers or suppliers, experience a labor\ndispute or disruption, it could result in increased costs, negative media attention and political controversy, which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\n109\nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the related Notes included in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements due to numerous factors, including the risks discussed in — How We Manage Risks — Risk Factors.\nOverview\nVEON is a leading global provider of connectivity and internet services, currently headquartered in Amsterdam. Present\nin some of the world’s most dynamic markets, VEON currently provides more than 160 million customers with voice, fixed\nbroadband, data and digital services. VEON, through its operating companies, offers services to customers in several countries:\nPakistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan. We provide services under the “Jazz,” “Kyivstar,”\n“Banglalink” and “Beeline” brands.\nVEON generates revenue from the provision of voice, data, digital and other telecommunication services through a\nrange of wireless, fixed and broadband internet services, as well as selling equipment, infrastructure and accessories.\nReportable Segments\nWe present our reportable segments based on economic environments and stages of development in different\ngeographical areas, requiring different investment and marketing strategies.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our reportable segments consist of the following segments: Pakistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan,\nUzbekistan and Bangladesh.\nOn November 24, 2022, VEON announced the sale of its Russian operations, and the Russian business was, in line\nwith IFRS 5 (Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations) requirements, treated as a discontinued operation\nand accounted for as an “Asset held for sale.” The sale of our Russian operations was completed on October 9, 2023. Our\nAlgerian business, following the exercise of the put option for our stake in Algeria on July 1, 2021 and subsequent completion of\nsale transaction on August 5, 2022, was disposed of (refer to Note 10 —Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations in our\nAudited Consolidated Financial Statements attached hereto for further details).\nWe also present our results of operations for “Others” and “HQ” separately, although these are not reportable segments.\n“Others” represents our operations in Kyrgyzstan and “HQ” represents transactions related to management activities within the\ngroup in Amsterdam and Dubai and costs relating to centrally managed operations, and reconciles the results of our reportable\nsegments and our total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.\nFor more information on our reportable segments, refer to Note 2—Segment Information in our Audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements attached hereto for further details.\nBasis of Presentation of Financial Results\nOur Audited Consolidated Financial Statements attached hereto have been prepared in accordance with International\nFinancial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European\nUnion (E.U.) and the applicable articles of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, effective at the time of preparing the Audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements and applied by VEON.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nFor a discussion of our accounting policies please refer to Note 24—Significant Accounting Policies of our Audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements attached hereto.\n110\nKey Developments\nKey Developments for the year ended December 31, 2023\nCompletion of Sale of Russian operations\nOn October 9, 2023, VEON announced the completion of its exit from Russia with closing of the sale of its Russian\noperations. On September 13, 2023, VEON and the buyer agreed on certain amendments to the Share Purchase Agreement\n(“SPA”) which had no material impact on the economic terms of the original transaction announced on November 24, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, VimpelCom independently purchased US$2,140 million equivalent of\nVEON Holdings bonds (based on applicable foreign exchange rates on the relevant purchase dates) in order to satisfy certain\nRussian regulatory obligations. VEON Holdings B.V. redeemed US$406 million of these notes from VimpelCom following their\nmaturity in September 2023.\nUpon the completion of the sale of our Russian Operations, VEON Holdings B.V. bonds representing a nominal value of\nUS$1,576 million which were acquired by VimpelCom were transferred to Unitel LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany) and offset against the purchase consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294 million on October 9,\n2023) on a non cash basis resulting in no impact on our cash flows.\nThe remaining deferred consideration of US$72 million as of December 31, 2023 was offset against VEON Holdings\nB.V. bonds acquired by VimpelCom representing a nominal value of US$72 million, in July 2024, in compliance with applicable\nregulatory licensing after receiving the relevant regulatory approvals. In addition, there was a US$11 million receivable against\nthe sale of towers in Russia recognized in prior periods that was also assigned to the Company as part of the sale transaction.\nRefer to Note 22 for further details.\nThe financial impact of the sale of our Russian operations is a loss of US$3,746 million recorded within (Loss) / Profit\nafter Tax from Discontinued Operations” in the Consolidated Income Statement, primarily due to US$3,414 million of cumulative\ncurrency translation losses which accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income and recycled through the\nconsolidated income statement on the date of the disposal. Overall, the sale of the Russian Operations resulted in significant\ndeleveraging of VEON’s balance sheet. For further details, refer to Note 10.\nBased on the applicable USD / RUB exchange rates at the applicable purchase dates (which took place between\nFebruary 2023 and September 2023).\nAgreement between Banglalink and Summit regarding the sale of its Bangladesh tower assets\nOn November 15, 2023, VEON announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Banglalink, has entered into an Asset Sale\nand Purchase Agreement (“APA”) and Master Tower Agreement (“MTA”), to sell a portion of its tower portfolio (2,012 towers,\nnearly one-third of Banglalink's infrastructure portfolio) in Bangladesh to the buyer, Summit, for BDT 11 billion (US$97 million).\nThe closing of the transaction was subject to regulatory approval which was received on December 21, 2023. Subsequently, the\ndeal closed on December 31, 2023. Under the terms of the deal, Banglalink entered into a long-term lease agreement with\nSummit under which Banglalink will lease space upon the sold towers for a period of 12 years, with up to seven optional renewal\nperiods of 10 years each. The lease agreement became effective upon the closing of the sale.\nAs of November 15, 2023, the Bangladesh towers were classified as assets held for sale. Following the classification as\ndisposal group held-for-sale, the Company did not account for depreciation and amortization expenses of the Bangladesh tower\nassets. As a result of the closing of the sale on December 31, 2023, control of the towers was transferred to Summit and\nBanglalink recognized the purchase consideration of BDT 11 billion (US$97 million) net of cost of disposals containing legal,\nregulatory and investment bankers costs amounting to BDT 855 million (US$8 million). The consideration was receivable as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and payment was subsequently received in January 2024 upon the final completion date under the terms of\nthe APA. As a result of applying sale and leaseback accounting principles to the lease agreement under the terms of the deal,\nBanglalink recognized a gain on sale of assets of BDT 4 billion (US$34 million), right-of-use assets of BDT 550 million (US$5\nmillion) representing the proportional fair value of assets (towers) retained with respect to the book value of assets (towers) sold\namounting to BDT 950 million (US$9 million) and lease liabilities of BDT 6 billion (US$52 million) based on a 12 year lease term,\nwhich are at market rates. Additional right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of BDT 4 billion (US$40 million) were recognized for\ntotal right-of-use assets of BDT 5 billion (US$45 million) and total lease liabilities of BDT 10 billion (US$92 million).\nCybersecurity Incident in Ukraine\nOn December 12, 2023, VEON announced that the network of its Ukrainian subsidiary Kyivstar had been the target of a\nwidespread external cyber-attack causing a technical failure. This resulted in a temporary disruption of Kyivstar's network and\nservices, interrupting the provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and fixed networks, international roaming, and SMS\nservices, amongst others, for Kyivstar customers in Ukraine and abroad. The Company’s technical teams, working relentlessly\nand in collaboration with the Ukrainian law enforcement and government agencies and the Security Service of Ukraine, restored\nservices in multiple stages starting with voice and data connectivity. On December 19, 2023, VEON announced that Kyivstar had\nrestored services in all categories of its communication services, and that mobile voice and internet, fixed connectivity and SMS\nservices as well as the MyKyivstar self-care application were active and available across Ukraine.\nAfter stabilizing the network, although there was no legal obligation to do so, Kyivstar immediately launched offers to\nthank its customers for their loyalty, initiating a “Free of Charge” program offering one month of free services on certain types of\n111\ncontracts. Furthermore, on December 21, 2023, Kyivstar announced a donation of UAH 100 million (US$3 million) would be\nmade towards Ukrainian charity initiatives.\nLargely due to the limited period during which the critical services were down, there was no material financial impact on\nour consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to these service disruptions, or due to costs associated with\nadditional IT capabilities required for restoring services, replacing lost equipment or compensating external consultants and\npartners in 2023. The incident had a significant impact on consolidated revenue results for the six-months ended June 30, 2024\nassociated with the revenue loss arising from the customer loyalty measures taken by Kyivstar in order to compensate for the\ninconvenience caused during the disruptions. The impact of these offers on operating revenue in 2024 was US$46 million. VEON\nexpects no further impact on its financial results arising from the customer loyalty measures under the retention programs, which\nended during the first half of 2024.\nVEON and Kyivstar conducted a thorough investigation, together with outside cybersecurity firms, to determine the full\nnature, extent and impact of the incident and to implement additional security measures to protect against any recurrence. The\nUkrainian government also conducted an investigation to support the recovery efforts. All investigations were concluded as of\nJune 30, 2024, and has resulted in an in depth analysis into details of how the attack was executed and how this can be\nprevented in the future.\nKyivstar has initiated remediation and mitigation actions to reduce current risks and establish a robust framework to\nmanage evolving cyber threats, protect business continuity and maintain customer trust by investing in immediate response\nactions, enhanced security infrastructure, proactive threat management, compliance with cybersecurity regulations and\nstandards, employee awareness, and long-term adaptive measures. Further, VEON Group has executed a group-wide\nassessment of cybersecurity maturity in alignment with the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity\nFramework 2.0 (NIST2).\nVEON’s Scheme of arrangement (the “Scheme”)\nFollowing the announcement made by VEON on November 24, 2022 to launch a scheme of arrangement to extend the\nmaturity of the 2023 Notes (the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and 7.25% notes due April 2023), the initial proposed scheme\nwas amended on January 11, 2023 and on January 24, 2023, the Scheme Meeting was held and the amended Scheme was\napproved by 97.59% of the Scheme creditors present and voting.\nOn January 30, 2023, VEON announced that the Scheme Sanction Hearing had taken place, at which the Court made an order\nsanctioning the Scheme in respect of VEON Holdings B.V.’ 2023 Notes (the “Order”). On January 31, 2023, VEON confirmed\nthat the Order had been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The amendments to the 2023 Notes were subject to the receipt\nof relevant licenses to become effective, at which time the maturity dates of the February 2023 and April 2023 notes would be\namended to October and December 2023, respectively.\nOn April 3, 2023, VEON announced that each of the conditions had been satisfied in accordance with the terms of the Scheme,\nincluding receipt of all authorizations and/or licenses necessary to implement the amendments to the 2023 Notes (as set out in\nthe Scheme). On April 4, 2023, the Scheme became effective.\nPursuant to the amendments, Noteholders were entitled to payment of an amendment fee of 200bps payable on the 2023\nNotes outstanding on their respective amended maturity dates and a put right was granted requiring VEON Holdings B.V. to\nrepurchase 2023 Notes held by 2023 Noteholders exercising such right, at a purchase price of 102% of the principal amount\n(“2023 Put Option”), together with accrued and unpaid interest. The 2023 Put Option closed on April 19, 2023 with holders of\nUS$165 million of the October 2023 Notes and holders of US$294 million of the December 2023 Notes exercising the Put\nOption. The aggregate put option premium paid was US$9 million. The 2023 Put Option was settled on April 26, 2023. The\nremaining October 2023 notes were repaid at maturity including an amendment fee of US$1 million. The notes maturing in\nDecember 2023 were called earlier and repaid on September 27, 2023, including an amendment fee of US$1 million. For further\ndetails, refer to further discussion in Note 16-Investments, Debt and Derivatives.\nVEON US$1,250 million multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement\nOn April 20, 2023, and May 30, 2023, the outstanding amounts under RCF facility have been rolled-over until October\n2023 for US$692 million and November 2023 for US$363 million. Further these outstanding amounts were rolled-over until\nJanuary 2024 for US$692 million and February 2024 for US$363 million. The RCF has subsequently been repaid and canceled\nin March 2024.\nUkraine prepayment\nIn 2023, Kyivstar fully prepaid all of its remaining external debt which includes a UAH 1,400 million (US$38 million) loan\nwith Raiffeisen Bank and UAH 760 million loan with OTP Bank (US$21 million).\nPMCL syndicated credit facility\nPMCL fully utilized the remaining PKR 10 billion (US$41 million) under its existing PKR 40 billion (US$164 million) facility\nthrough drawdowns in January and April 2023.\n112\nBDCL syndicated credit facility\nBDCL utilized BDT 5 billion (US$45 million) out of new syndicate credit facility of BDT 8 billion (US$73 million) during\nNovember 2023. The tenor of the facility is five years.\nKaR-Tel Limited Liability Partnership (\"KaR-Tel\") credit facility\nKaR-Tel utilized KZT 9.8 billion (US$22 million) from the bilateral credit facility with ForteBank JSC during the period of\nSeptember to December 2023. Through a deed of amendment signed in February 2024, the maturity of the facility was extended\nto November 2026 and facility amount enhanced to KZT 15 billion from KZT 10 billion.\nRepayment of VEON Holdings B.V. 5.95% Senior Notes\nOn October 13, 2023 VEON Holdings B.V. repaid its outstanding 5.95% Senior Notes amounting to US$39 million at their\nmaturity date.\nEarly redemption of VEON Holdings B.V. 2023 and 2024 Notes\nOn September 13, 2023, VEON Holdings B.V. issued two redemption notices for the early repayment of its bonds\nmaturing in December 2023 and June 2024, with a planned redemption date of September 27, 2023. On that date, VEON\nHoldings B.V. redeemed US$243 million senior notes held by external noteholders, and on October 4, 2023, redeemed US$406\nmillion senior notes held by VimpelCom. Please refer to Note 16-Investments, Debt and Derivatives for further details.\nU.S. Treasury expands general license to include both VEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings B.V.\nOn January 18, 2023, VEON announced that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control\n(OFAC) replaced the General License 54 originally issued on November 18, 2022 with General License 54A to now include both\nVEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings.\nThis general license authorizes all transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to the purchase and receipt of any\ndebt or equity securities of VEON Ltd. or VEON Holdings B.V. that would otherwise be prohibited by section 1(a)(i) of Executive\nOrder (E.O.) 14071. OFAC General License 54A applies to all debt and equity securities of VEON Ltd. or VEON Holdings B.V.\nthat were issued before June 6, 2022, and confirms that the authorization applies not only to the purchase and receipt of debt\nand equity securities, but also to transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to facilitating, clearing and settling of such\ntransactions. This General License ensures that all market participants can trade the relevant securities with confidence that\nsuch trading is consistent with E.O. 14071, which targeted “new investment” in Russia.\nFreezing of corporate rights in Kyivstar\nOn October 6, 2023, the Security Services of Ukraine (SSU) announced that the Ukrainian courts were seizing all\n“corporate rights” of Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and Andriy Kosogov in 20 Ukrainian companies that these individuals beneficially\nown, while criminal proceedings, unrelated to Kyivstar or VEON, were in progress. This announcement was incorrectly\ncharacterized by some Ukrainian media as a “seizure” or “freezing” of “Kyivstar’s assets” as the assets of Kyivstar had not been\nseized or frozen and the court’s ruling did not impact the assets of Kyivstar directly. On October 9, 2023, Ukrainian media further\nreported, with a headline which incorrectly targeted Kyivstar, that the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine was separately finalizing a\nlawsuit in the Ukraine High Anti-Corruption Court to confiscate any Ukrainian assets of M. Fridman. Subsequent clarification by\nthe SSU noted that “The seizure of corporate rights of Ukrainian companies does not affect the protection of the interests of\nforeign investors and owners of shares of corporate rights, does not hinder their economic activity and the possibility of receiving\ndividends.” We have received notification from our local custodian that 47.85% of Kyivstar shares have been blocked, which will\nprevent any transaction involving our Kyivstar shares, including transfer of such shares, from proceeding. On October 30, 2023\nVEON announced that VEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings B.V. had filed two appeals with the relevant Kyiv court of appeals,\nchallenging the freezing of the corporate rights in Kyivstar, noting that corporate rights in Kyivstar belong exclusively to VEON\nand that their full or partial seizure directly violates the rights of VEON and its international debt and equity investors, and\nrequesting the lifting of the freezing of its corporate rights in Kyivstar. In December 2023, the court rejected our appeals. On June\n4, 2024, the CEO of VEON, in his capacity as a shareholder of VEON, filed a motion with Shevchenkiv District Court of Kyiv\nrequesting cancellation of the seizure of corporate rights in the VEON group's subsidiary Ukraine Tower Company. On June 26,\n2024, the motion was supplemented to request cancellation of the seizure of corporate rights in the VEON group's other\nUkrainian subsidiaries: Kyivstar, Kyivstar.Tech and Helsi. VEON is continuing significant government affairs efforts to protect our\nassets in Ukraine. Restrictions applicable in Ukraine to all foreign-owned companies have already led to restrictions on the\nupstreaming of dividends from Ukraine to VEON. Additionally, to the extent that VEON and/or Kyivstar are deemed to be\ncontrolled by persons sanctioned in Ukraine, potential prohibitions on renting property and land, on participating in public\nprocurement and on the transfer of technology and intellectual property rights to Kyivstar from VEON impacting B2G revenue\nwould also apply.\nBased on the above development, VEON assessed whether the court order and subsequent motions result in an event\nthat VEON has lost control over its Ukrainian subsidiary (“Kyivstar”) and concluded that, under the requirements of relevant\nreporting standards (IFRS 10, Consolidated financial Statements), VEON continues to control Kyivstar and as such, will continue\nto consolidate Kyivstar in these financial statements.\n113\nVEON Ltd. implements new Clawback Policy\nOn November 27, 2023, VEON Ltd. announced governance enhancements to its executive remuneration structure, in\nline with its commitment to ethical corporate governance practices and financial integrity.

The number of common VEON Ltd. shares to be transferred will be determined on the vesting date based on\nthe 90-day average trading price. Finally, VEON Ltd., in its sole discretion, may pay Impact Investments an additional fee up to\n$3 million subject to completion of certain strategic objectives.\nOn June 7, 2024, VEON Ltd. and Impact Investments also entered into a termination letter in connection with a letter\nagreement between VEON Ltd. and Impact Investments dated November 16, 2023. Under the terms of the termination letter,\nVEON Ltd. paid Impact Investments $2 million in common VEON Ltd. shares or 2,066,954 shares (equal to 82,678 ADS), which\ncommon shares were determined on the basis of the 90-day average trading price of the VEON Ltd. common shares as of the\ndate of the termination letter. These VEON Ltd common shares were transferred to Impact Investments in August 2024, for\nstrategic support and board advisory services to JSC Kyivstar performed by Impact Investments under the letter agreement\nbetween VEON Ltd., JSC Kyivstar and Impact Investments dated November 16, 2023.\nVEON Ltd. Announces Plan to Move its Headquarters to Dubai\nOn October 14, 2024, VEON Ltd. announced its plan to move the Group Headquarters from Amsterdam to the DIFC in\nthe United Arab Emirates. VEON Ltd. also plans to update its corporate entity structure to reflect the relocation of the\nheadquarters from move from the Netherlands to the DIFC, subject to tax and structuring. On November 15, 2024,VEON Ltd.\nfurther announced that it has completed the registration of and received the commercial license for its branch office in Dubai\nInternational Finance Centre (“DIFC”).\nKaR-Tel Limited Liability Partnership credit facilities\nOn September 25, 2024 KaR-Tel Limited Liability Partnership (\"KaR-Tel\") signed a new bilateral credit facility with JSC\nNurbank of KZT 18 billion (US$37) with a maturity of five years carrying fixed interest rate of 15.5%. On October 8, 2024, KaR-\nTel utilized KZT 4.5 billion (US$10) from this facility. Subsequently, during October and November 2024, Kar-Tel further utilized\nKZT 6 billion (US$12).\n2024 Annual Impairment Analysis\nDuring July and August 2024 there was increased political uncertainty in Bangladesh culminating in network outages\nand blockages experienced by our Bangladesh subsidiary in connection with mass protests, civil unrest and riots that resulted in\nthe fall of the government of Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina and the establishment of an interim government. These events and\nthe political unrest have negatively impacted the populations’ disposable income and influenced telecom spending patterns, while\nincreased operation costs for the business unit identified indicators of an impairment event with respect to our Bangladesh CGU\nin the third quarter of 2024. Management has not yet finalized the quantitative and qualitative assessments and valuation tests\nrequired to determine the estimated financial impact of such triggers in Bangladesh during the third quarter of 2024. Preliminary\nanalysis suggests that we may incur a substantial impairment charge to the carrying value of the Bangladesh CGU for the period\nended September 30, 2024. As of the date of November 20, 2024, we do not have enough certainty to provide an estimate of the\ncharge or range of potential outcomes, but initial results of quantitative and qualitative assessments and valuation tests indicate\nthat an impairment charge is likely to be material. We, however, cannot rule out the possibility that the final results of our\nimpairment analysis may deviate significantly from our preliminary assessment. Final results of the analysis will be published in\nour interim unaudited consolidated condensed financial statement for the period ended September 30, 2024. Following the\nannual impairment goodwill test as at September 30, 2023 and the subsequent triggering event analysis as at December 31,\n2023, no impairments were found at our Bangladesh CGU as, amongst other factors, it was operating in a revenue growth period\n(which period lasted through our second quarter of 2024), however, the Bangladesh CGU did have limited headroom in its\ncarrying value; as a result, the impairment charge is expected to have a direct impact on our operating profit. See Note 11—\nImpairment of Assets to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. The circumstances in Bangladesh\ncould also impact our assessment relating to the recognition and recoverability of our deferred tax assets in Bangladesh.\nChanges in Directors of VEON Holdings B.V.\nOn March 7, 2024, Bruce John Leishman and Maciej Bogdan Wojtaszek were appointed statutory directors of the\nCompany, while on the same date Jochem Benjamin Postma and Paul Klaassen stepped down as statutory directors of the\nCompany.\nIssuance of PKR Sukuk bond by Pakistan Mobile Communication Limited (\"PMCL\")\nIn October 2024, Pakistan Mobile Communication Limited (\"PMCL\") issued short term PKR sukuk bond of PKR 15\nbillion (US$54) with a maturity of six months. Coupon rate is 3 months Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (KIBOR) minus 10 bps per\nannum.\n119\nUnitel LLC credit facility\nOn October 7, 2024 Unitel LLC signed a new credit facility agreement with JSC “National Bank for Foreign Economic\nActivity of the Republic of Uzbekistan” for UZS 191.3 billion (US$14) with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 22% per\nannum. During November 2024, Unitel LLC utilized the full amount from this facility.\nVEON appoints UHY LLP as auditors for VEON Group's 2024 PCAOB Audit\nOn November 13, 2024, VEON announced that the VEON Board of Directors has re-appointed UHY LLP (“UHY”) as\nthe independent registered public accounting firm for the audit of the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year\nended December 31, 2024 in accordance with the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,\nUnited States (the \"PCAOB Audit\").\n120\nFactors Affecting Comparability and Results of Operations\nThe War Between Russia and Ukraine\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine has had a significant impact on our business. As the war commenced in February\n2022 and is ongoing, our results for 2022 and 2023 have been impacted and we anticipate that our future results of operations\nwill be adversely impacted and not comparable to past results of operations due to the volatility in foreign currency exchange\nrates, the potential loss of some customers in Ukraine, the impact of sanctions and export control restrictions and numerous\nother factors. Since the war began, we have faced and expect to continue to face challenges with our performance in Ukraine,\nwhich will be exacerbated as the war continues. Furthermore, if there is an extended continuation or further increase in the\nseverity of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, it could result in further instability and/or worsening of the overall\npolitical and economic situation in Ukraine, Europe and/or the global economy and capital markets generally. These are highly\nuncertain times and it is not possible to predict with precision how certain developments will impact our results and operations,\nnor is it possible to execute comprehensive contingency planning in Ukraine due to the ongoing war and inherent danger in the\ncountry. See Risk Factors—Market Risks—The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is having, and will continue to have,\nan impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOur Audited Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars and in accordance with IAS 21, The\nEffects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, using the current rate method of currency translation with the U.S. dollar as the\nreporting currency. Our results of operations are affected by increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar or our\nfunctional currencies. A higher average exchange rate will correlate to a weaker functional currency. The functional currencies of\nour reportable segments are the Pakistani rupee in Pakistan, the Bangladeshi taka in Bangladesh, the Ukrainian hryvnia in\nUkraine, the Uzbekistani som in Uzbekistan and the Kazakhstani tenge in Kazakhstan. See Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures about Market Risk for a further discussion. For a discussion on risks associated with foreign currency translations\nrelated to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, see —Risk Factors—Market Risks—We are exposed to foreign\ncurrency exchange loss, fluctuation and translation risks, including as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.\nEconomic Trends\nAs a global telecommunications company with operations in a number of markets, we are affected by a broad range of\ninternational economic developments. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of our customers,\nwhich includes their spending patterns, both in terms of the products they subscribe for and usage levels. As a result, it may be\nmore difficult for us to attract new customers, more likely that customers will downgrade or disconnect their services and more\ndifficult for us to maintain mobile ARPUs at existing levels. Therefore, downturns in the economies of markets in which we\noperate or may operate in the future could also, among other things, increase our costs, prevent us from executing our business\nstrategies, hurt our liquidity or prevent us to meet unexpected financial requirements. The ongoing war between Russia and\nUkraine, and the responses of governments and multinational businesses to it, created critical challenges for our business and\noperations, significantly affected our operations and financial condition in 2023, and will likely continue to have a significant\nimpact for the foreseeable future both in Ukraine and globally.\nFurthermore, the increasing price for fossil fuels and rising inflation rates are expected to have broader adverse effects on many\nof the economies in which we operate and may result in recessionary periods and lower corporate investment, which, in turn,\ncould lead to economic strain on our business and on current and potential customers. Sustained high levels of inflation or\nhyperinflation in Ukraine, in addition to deteriorating economic conditions as a result of the ongoing war with Russia, may create\nsignificant imbalances in the Ukraine economy and undermine any efforts the government is taking to create conditions that\nsupport economic growth in the wake of the war with Russia, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our results of\noperations. For more information regarding economic trends and how they affect our operations, see .—Risk Factors—Market\nRisks.\nAcquisitions, Dispositions and Divestitures\nFrom time to time, we undertake acquisitions, dispositions and divestitures, which may affect comparability across\nperiods and our results of operations. Our decision to engage in such transactions will be opportunistic and subject to market\nconditions. Consummation of such transactions may have an effect on comparability of our results of operations and financial\ncondition across certain periods as changes to our asset base and revenue streams will be reflected in our financial statements.\nFor example, during 2022, we sold our operating company in Georgia and entered into an agreement to sell our Russian\nOperations. The sale of our Georgia operating company was completed on June 8, 2022 (see Note 9—Significant Transactions\nof our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result of the disposal of our Russian Operations, we classified them as\nheld-for-sale and discontinued operations upon the signing of the agreement on November 24, 2022, and the sale transaction\ncompleted on October 9, 2023. In 2023, our net loss for the period was primarily a result of the sale of our Russian operations,\nwhich resulted in US$3.4 billion cumulative currency translations losses reflected in equity in our other comprehensive income\nand which impacted our income statement on the completion date of the disposal. See Note 10—Held for Sale and Discontinued\nOperations to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion.\nExecution of Business Strategies and Initiatives\n121\nIn September 2019, we announced a strategy framework comprising of three vectors: infrastructure, digital operator and\nventures (now digital assets). See —History and Development of the Company for further information on what this strategic\nframework entails. In the first quarter of 2021, we initiated a cost efficiency program called Project Optimum to cultivate a\nmindset of continuous efficiency building and an improvement of actual costs. Since 2021, as part of our “Digital Operator” vector,\nour operating companies have been executing our “digital operator 1440” model pursuant to which we aim to enrich our connectivity offering\nwith proprietary digital applications and services. With this model, we aspire to grow not only the market share of our operators, but also the\nrelevance and the wallet share of our businesses and industry by delivering value via, for example, mobile entertainment, mobile health,\nmobile education, and mobile financial services. Major saving initiatives since the launch of Project Optimum include bandwidth cost\noptimizations, content costs reduction through vendor negotiations and in-house development, network maintenance\noptimizations and the implementation of smart-metering solutions. In 2023, a total of 167 savings initiatives in Pakistan,\nBangladesh, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan contributed to considerable organic savings. Still, no assurances can be given for the\nachievement of intended results or further savings within the mentioned timeframes, though the impact of these initiatives are\nroutinely reported in our investor communications.\nChanges in Tax Regimes\nChanges in tax regimes have the potential to affect our business and results of operations. For example, as a result of\nthe changes in tax legislation in Kazakhstan that became effective on January 1, 2024, the withholding tax rate applicable to\nprofit distributions from Kazakhstan to the Netherlands increased from 0% to 5%, which contributed to restrictions on the\ndistributable profits at VEON Holdings B.V. For a further discussion of the risks relating to VEON Holdings B.V.’s ability to\nwithdraw funds and dividends from our subsidiaries and operating companies, see Risk Factors—Operational Risks—As a\nholding company with a number of operating subsidiaries, we depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to\npay dividends or make other transfers to VEON Holdings B.V., as well as the ability to make certain intercompany payments and\ntransfers.\n122\nCertain Performance Indicators\nThe following discussion provides a description of certain operating data that is not included in our financial statements.\nWe provide this operating data because it is regularly reviewed by our management and our management believes it is useful in\nevaluating our performance from period to period as set out below. Our management believes that presenting information about\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, mobile customers, mobile ARPU, mobile data customers, capital expenditures\n(excluding licenses and right-of-use assets) and local currency financial measures is useful in assessing the usage and\nacceptance of our mobile and broadband products and services.\nFor an explanation of how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, capital expenditures (excluding\nlicenses and right-of-use assets), and local currency financial measures, please see Explanatory Note—Non-IFRS Financial\nMeasures. For a description of how we define 4G users, digital services monthly active users, doubleplay 4G customers, mobile\nARPU, mobile customers, mobile data customers, mobile financial services or digital financial services and multiplay customers,\nplease see the discussion below.\n4G users\n4G users are mobile customers who have engaged in revenue-generating activity during the three months prior to the\nmeasurement date as a result of activities over fourth-generation (4G or LTE – long term evolution) network technologies.\nDigital services monthly active users\nDigital services monthly active users (“MAUs”) is a gross total of monthly active users of all digital products and services\noffered by an entity or by VEON Group and includes MAUs who are active in more than one application. It is a total cumulative\nMAU of all VEON digital platforms, services and applications.\nDoubleplay 4G customers\nDoubleplay 4G customers are mobile customers who engaged in usage of our voice and data services over 4G (LTE)\ntechnology at any time during the one month prior to such measurement date.\nMobile ARPU\nMobile ARPU measures the monthly average revenue per mobile user. We generally calculate mobile ARPU by dividing\nour mobile service revenue during the relevant period, including data revenue, roaming revenue and interconnect revenue, but\nexcluding revenue from connection fees, sales of handsets and accessories and other non-service revenue, by the average\nnumber of our mobile customers during the period and dividing by the number of months in that period.\nMobile customers\nMobile customers are generally customers in the registered customer base as of a given measurement date who\nengaged in a revenue generating activity at any time during the three months prior to such measurement date. Such activity\nincludes any outgoing calls, customer fee accruals, debits related to service, outgoing SMS and MMS, data transmission and\nreceipt sessions, but does not include incoming calls, SMS and MMS or abandoned calls. Our total number of mobile customers\nalso includes customers using mobile internet service via USB modems.\nMobile data customers\nMobile data customers are mobile customers who have engaged in revenue generating activity during the three months\nprior to the measurement date as a result of activities including USB modem Internet access using 2.5G/3G/4G/LTE/HSPA+\ntechnologies.\nMobile financial services or digital financial services\nMobile financial services (MFS) or digital financial services (DFS) is a variety of innovative services, such as mobile\ncommerce that uses a mobile phone as the primary payment user interface and allows mobile customers to conduct money\ntransfers to pay for items such as goods at an online store, utility payments, fines and state fees, loan repayments, domestic and\ninternational remittances, mobile insurance and tickets for air and rail travel, all via their mobile phone.\nMultiplay customers\nMultiplay customers are doubleplay 4G customers who also engaged in usage of one or more of our digital products at\nany time during the one month prior to such measurement date.\n123\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear ended December 31,\nIn millions of U.S. dollars 2023 2022\nConsolidated income statement data:\nService revenues 3,577 3,600\nSale of equipment and accessories 19 28\nOther revenues 98 127\nTotal operating revenues 3,694 3,755\nOther operating income 2 2\nService costs (422) (448)\nCost of equipment and accessories (18) (28)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (1,484) (1,397)\nDepreciation (548) (564)\nAmortization (205) (218)\nImpairment reversal 8 115\nGain on disposal of non-current assets 48 3\nGain on disposal of subsidiaries — 94\nOperating profit 1,075 1,314\nFinance costs (567) (609)\nFinance income 146 79\nOther non-operating gain, net 14 26\nNet foreign exchange gain 81 188\nProfit before tax from continuing operations 749 998\nIncome taxes (173) (67)\nProfit from continuing operations 576 931\nLoss after tax from discontinued operations and disposals of discontinued operations (2,830) (739)\n(Loss) / profit for the period (2,254) 192\nAttributable to:\nThe owners of the parent (continuing operations) 503 852\nThe owners of the parent (discontinued operations) (2,835) (814)\nNon-controlling interest 78 154\n(2,254) 192\nTotal Operating Revenue\nYear ended December 31,\nIn millions of U.S. dollars, includes intersegment revenue 2023 2022\nPakistan 1,119 1,285\nUkraine 919 971\nKazakhstan 774 636\nUzbekistan 268 233\nBangladesh 570 576\nOthers 55 66\nHQ and eliminations (11) (12)\nTotal 3,694 3,755\n124\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our consolidated total operating revenue decreased to US$3,694 million as\ncompared to US$3,755 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This was a decrease of 1.6% primarily due to currency\ndepreciation in countries where we operate. At a constant currency level year on year, there was an increase in service revenue\nof 18.1% driven by increased 4G penetration, content revenue in Pakistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Bangladesh\noperations that was partially offset by the lower usage from the Cybersecurity attack in Ukraine on December 12, 2023. This\norganic growth was offset by the depreciating currencies in the countries where we operate. For further details, please refer to —\nResults of our Reportable Segments below.\nOperating Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our consolidated operating profit decreased to US$1,075 million as compared\nto US$1,314 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Operating profit decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in\noperating revenue as well as due to increased one-off expenses at HQ recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n125\nNon-Operating Profits And Losses\nFinance Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our consolidated finance costs were US$567 million as compared to US$609\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is mainly due to debt reduction, partially offset by higher interest\nrates of our floating Pakistani rupee and U.S. dollar denominated debt.\nFinance Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our consolidated finance income was US$146 million as compared to US$79\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in finance income was primarily due to higher interest rates.\nOther Non-Operating Gain / (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded other non-operating gains of US$14 million as compared to a\nnon-operating gain of US$26 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is driven by higher interest income on\nmoney market funds, partially offset by losses on other financial assets..\nNet Foreign Exchange Gain / (Loss)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a net foreign exchange gain of US$81 million as compared to a\nnet foreign exchange gain of US$188 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The net foreign exchange gain of US$ 81\nmillion in 2023 was due to the impact of the depreciation of Pakistani rupee and Bangladeshi taka against the U.S. dollar that\nwas offset by the appreciation of Russian ruble and corresponding impacts on loans and bonds denominated in Russian rubles.\nFor a discussion of risks related to foreign currency fluctuation and translation, see Risk Factors—Market Risks—We are\nexposed to foreign currency exchange loss, fluctuation and translation risks, including as a result of the ongoing war between\nRussia and Ukraine.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our consolidated income tax expense increased by 158% to US$173 million as\ncompared to US$67 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For more information regarding the factors affecting our total\nincome tax expenses, please refer to Note 8—Income Taxes of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements attached hereto.\nProfit / (Loss) after Tax from Discontinued Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a loss after tax from discontinued operations of US$2,830 million\nas compared to a loss after tax from discontinued operations of US$739 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The year\non year change is mainly associated with the loss of US$3,746 million recognized during the year 2023 on sale of our Russian\noperations and profit after tax on Russian operations of US$916 million, compared to the loss after tax in our Russian and Algeria\nOperations for the year 2022. Please refer to Note 9 — Significant Transactions of our Audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements attached hereto.\nProfit / (Loss) For The Period Attributable To The Owners Of The Parent From Continuing Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a profit attributable to the owners of the parent from continuing\noperations of US$503 million as compared to US$852 million in 2022, that was mainly due to a decrease in operating profit\ndriven by impairment reversal and net foreign exchange gains during 2022 coupled with an increase in consolidated income tax\nexpense.\nProfit / (Loss) For The Period Attributable To Non-Controlling Interest\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a profit attributable to non-controlling interest of US$78 million as\ncompared to a profit of US$154 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was mainly driven by a decrease in\noperating profit.\n126\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIn millions of U.S. dollars Year ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nPakistan 502 654\nUkraine 541 575\nKazakhstan 421 321\nUzbekistan 112 124\nBangladesh 214 210\nOthers 22 26\nHQ and eliminations (40) (26)\nTotal 1,772 1,884\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our total Adjusted EBITDA was US$1,772 million as compared to US$1,884\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. This was a decrease of (5.9)% that was mainly due to currency depreciation\nimpacts from the Pakistan and Bangladesh operations. At a constant currency level, the organic revenue growth as discussed\nabove was offset by the higher operating costs associated with persistent increase in energy costs in our Pakistan, Ukraine and\nBangladesh operations coupled with higher technical support costs, professional consultancy and tax provision costs during the\nyear.\nFor more information on how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA and for the reconciliation of consolidated profit / (loss)\nbefore tax from continuing operations, the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, please refer to the table below.\nYear ended December 31,\nIn millions of U.S. dollars 2023 2022\nProfit before tax from continuing operations 749 998\nDepreciation 548 564\nAmortization 205 218\nImpairment reversal (8) (115)\nLoss on disposal of non-current assets (48) (3)\nGain on disposal of subsidiaries — (94)\nFinance costs 567 609\nFinance income (146) (79)\nOther non-operating gain (14) (26)\nNet foreign exchange gain (81) (188)\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA 1,772 1,884\n.\n127\nResults of our Reportable Segments\nPakistan\nResults of Operations in US$\nYear ended December 31,\n‘22-23 ‘21-22\nIn millions of U.S. dollars (except as indicated) 2023 2022 2021 % change % change\nTotal operating revenue 1,119 1,285 1,408 -12.9 % -8.7 %\nMobile service revenue 1,021 1,169 1,285 -12.7 % -9.0 %\n- of which mobile data 459 521 534 -11.9 % -2.4 %\nSales of equipment, accessories and other 79 116 123 -31.9 % -5.7 %\nOperating expenses 617 631 765 -2.2 % -17.5 %\nAdjusted EBITDA 502 654 643 -23.2 % 1.7 %\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 44.9 % 50.9 % 45.7 % -6.0 pp 5.2 pp\nResults of Operations in PKR\nYear ended December 31,\n‘22-23 ‘21-22\nIn millions of PKR (except as indicated) 2023 2022 2021 % change % change\nTotal operating revenue 313,574 261,621 228,927 19.9 % 14.3 %\nMobile service revenue 286,183 238,084 208,923 20.2 % 14.0 %\n- of which mobile data 128,495 105,960 86,977 21.3 % 21.8 %\nSales of equipment, accessories and other 21,991 23,537 20,004 14.2 % 17.7 %\nOperating expenses 172,884 127,574 124,360 35.5 % 2.6 %\nAdjusted EBITDA 140,680 134,047 104,567 4.9 % 28.2 %\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 44.9 % 51.2 % 45.7 % -6.4 pp 5.6 pp\nSelected Performance Indicators\nYear ended December 31,\n‘22-23 ‘21-22\n2023 2022 2021 % change % change\nMobile\nCustomers in millions 70.6 73.7 72.6 -4.2 % 1.5 %\nMobile data customers in millions 53.0 52.8 50.9 0.4 % 3.7 %\nARPU in US$ 1.2 1.3 1.5 -7.7 % -13.3 %\nARPU in PKR 328.0 269.0 248.0 21.9 % 8.5 %\nTotal Operating Revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our Pakistan total operating revenue decreased by 12.9% (in US$ terms) and\nincreased by 19.9% (in local currency terms), as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This change in local currency\nterms is mainly due to increased 4G penetration, higher service revenue owing to increased usage and pricing in addition to\nstronger uptake of digital services, as well as higher volume content services relating to application to personal products that\ngenerated a growth in mobile data revenue. There was a one-off SIM issuance tax release in 2022 which had an incremental\nimpact in 2022 and is also contributing to variance when compared to this year. This organic local currency increase was offset\nby the deterioration in Pakistani rupee during the year 2023 in US$ terms.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our Pakistan Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 23.2% (in US$ terms) and\nincrease by 4.9% (in local currency terms), as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This change is primarily\nattributable to higher revenues (in local currency terms) as discussed above partially offset by increased operational expenses\nassociated with general and administrative and structural operating costs owing to higher energy prices and increased marketing\ncost as well as a one off positive impact of Pakistan SIM tax reversals in 2022 contributing to year on year variance this year. The\ndeterioration of Pakistani rupee was the main reason for year-on-year change in US$ terms that offset the positive local currency\ngrowth in EBITDA during 2023.\n128\nNumber of Mobile Customers\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 70.6 million mobile customers in Pakistan, representing a decrease of 4.2% as\ncompared to December 31, 2022. This was driven primarily by higher churn owing to aggressive pricing during the year. There\nwas a growth in mobile data customers that increased by 0.4% over the same period. The increase was mainly due to the\ncontinued expansion of our 4G data network in Pakistan.\nMobile ARPU\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our mobile ARPU in Pakistan was lower as compared to 2022 by 7.7% (in US$\nterms) due to devaluation of the PKR against US$, and increased by 21.9% (in local currency terms). These changes in local\ncurrency are mainly the result of an increase in mobile data revenues as discussed above.\n129\nUkraine\nResults of Operations in US$\nYear ended December 31,\n‘22-23 ‘21-22\nIn millions of U.S. dollars (except as indicated) 2023 2022 2021 % change % change\nTotal operating revenue 919 971 1055 -5.4 % -8.0 %\nMobile service revenue 859 906 980 -5.2 % -7.6 %\n- of which mobile data 507 527 590 -3.8 % -10.7 %\nFixed-line service revenue 53 59 68 -10.2 % -13.2 %\nSales of equipment, accessories and other 7 6 7 16.7 % -14.3 %\nOperating expenses 378 396 351 -4.5 % 12.8 %\nAdjusted EBITDA 541 575 704 -5.9 % -18.3 %\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 58.9 % 59.2 % 66.7 % -0.3 pp -7.5 pp\nResults of Operations in UAH\nYear ended December 31,\n‘22-23 ‘21-22\nIn millions of UAH (except as indicated) 2023 2022 2021 % change % change\nTotal operating revenue 33,588 31,092 28,748 8.0 % 8.2 %\nMobile service revenue 31,397 29,014 26,712 8.2 % 8.6 %\n- of which mobile data 18,528 16,837 16,092 10.0 % 4.6 %\nFixed-line service revenue 1,922 1,879 1,859 2.3 % 1.1 %\nSales of equipment, accessories and other 269 198 176 35.9 % 12.5 %\nOperating expenses 13,816 12,795 9,556 8.0 % 33.9 %\nAdjusted EBITDA 19,775 18,301 19,196 8.1 % -4.7 %\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 58.9 % 58.9 % 66.8 % — pp -7.9 pp\nSelected Performance Indicators\nYear ended December 31,\n‘22-23 ‘21-22\n2023 2022 2021 % change % change\nMobile\nCustomers in millions 23.9 24.8 26.2 -3.6 % -5.3 %\nMobile data customers in millions 17.7 17.5 18.5 1.1 % -5.4 %\nARPU in US$ 2.9 3.0 3.1 -3.3 % -3.2 %\nARPU in UAH 107.0 95.0 85.0 12.6 % 11.8 %\nTotal Operating Revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our Ukraine total operating revenue decreased by 5.4% (in US$ terms) and\nincreased by 8.0% (in local currency terms) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in local currency\nterms is primarily due to changes in tariff plans and higher international interconnect usage and roaming traffic which was in turn\noffset by lower usage due to a cyber security attack in December 2023 (refer to Note 1- General information to our Audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements attached hereto). The US$ change is mainly driven by deterioration of local currency against\nUS$ in 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our Ukraine Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 5.9% (in US$ terms) and\nincreased by 8.1% (in local currency terms) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This change is primarily due to\nthe increase in our total operating revenue (as discussed above), which was offset by higher energy costs (as a result of a\nsignificant increase in prices) and increased network maintenance and higher marketing costs.\nNumber of Mobile Customers\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 23.9 million mobile customers in Ukraine representing a decrease of 3.6% year-on-\nyear.

Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. The change was\nprimarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as compared to 2022 mainly as a result of proceeds from sale of\nAlgeria operations, which was partially offset by the decrease in trade and other receivables when compared to 2022.\nOur working capital is monitored on a regular basis by management. Our management expects to repay our debt, as it\nbecomes due, from our operating cash flows or refinanced through additional borrowings. Although we have a negative working\ncapital, our management believes that our cash balances and available credit facilities are sufficient to meet our present\nrequirements. For a further discussion of our liquidity profile and the impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine, see —\nFuture Liquidity and Capital Requirements below.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared on a going concern basis of\naccounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in\nthe normal course of business.

In addition, the\nCompany faces currency controls in Ukraine, which impact Kyivstar’s ability to upstream cash, including as dividends. For more\ninformation on these risks, see —Risk Factors—Operational Risks—As a holding company with a number of operating\nsubsidiaries, we depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or make other transfers to\nVEON Holdings B.V., as well as the ability to make certain intercompany payments and transfers.\nFuture Liquidity and Capital Requirements\nTelecommunications service providers require significant amounts of capital to construct networks and attract\ncustomers. In the foreseeable future, our further expansion will require significant investment activity, including the purchase of\nequipment and possibly the acquisition of other companies.\nIn 2023, our capital expenditures (excluding licenses and right-of-use assets) were US$631 million compared to\nUS$836 million in 2022. These investments related to upgrades and expansions of high-speed data networks across all our\ncountries of operations.\nWhile our medium-term plan for capital expenditures (excluding licenses and right-of-use assets) is to invest in high-\nspeed data networks to continue to capture mobile data growth, including the continued roll-out of 4G/LTE networks in Pakistan,\nUkraine and Bangladesh, and upgrade of our 3G networks in Bangladesh, the ongoing war in Russia and Ukraine has caused us\nto reconsider our capital outlay to ensure we have sufficient liquidity for maintenance capital expenditures and other key\noperational spend while at the same time servicing our indebtedness. As a result, capital expenditures that are more\ndiscretionary in nature have been put on hold since 2022 from time to time and may continue to be put on hold until the impact of\nthe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, and particularly its effects on our liquidity and financial profile, becomes more\ncertain.\nManagement anticipates that the funds necessary to meet our current and expected capital requirements in the\nforeseeable future (including with respect to any possible acquisitions) will continue to come from:\n• cash we currently hold;\n• operating cash flows;\n• proceeds of assets classified as held for sale;\n• borrowings under syndicated bank financings, including credit lines currently available to us, and private credit\nfinancings; and\n138\n• issuances of debt securities on local and international capital markets.\nFollowing the onset of the war between Russia and Ukraine, our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness\nhas been materially impaired, due to restrictive currency controls in Ukraine, and sanctions in relation to the war. The availability\nof external financing depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, the success of our operations, contractual\nrestrictions, the financial position of international and local banks, the willingness of international and local banks or private credit\nfunds to lend to our companies (including as a result of any sanctions concerns) and the liquidity and strength of international\nand local capital markets. Due to the adverse impact the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has had on us, the terms of\nsuch external financing may be less favorable than our existing financing, including due to the reputational harm we have\nsuffered. See Risk Factors—Market Risks—We have suffered reputational harm as a result of the ongoing war between Russia\nand Ukraine.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had an undrawn amount of US$38 million under the existing Bangladesh and\nKazakhstan term facilities. For additional information on our outstanding indebtedness, please refer to Note 18 — Financial Risk\nManagement of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements attached hereto. On December 31, 2023, VEON had\napproximately US$1.3 billion of cash held at the level of its headquarters (“HQ”), which was deposited with international banks\nand invested in money market funds and which is fully accessible at HQ. In addition, VEON’s operating companies had a total\ncash position equivalent to US$0.6 billion. However, there can be no assurance that our existing cash balances and available\ncredit lines will be sufficient over time to service our existing indebtedness, including to address our upcoming bond maturities.\nSee —Risk Factors—Liquidity and Capital Risks—Our substantial amounts of indebtedness and debt service obligations could\nmaterially decrease our cash flow, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWhile we currently have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our current obligations at least over the next 12 months,\nmanagement identified material uncertainties as a result of the war. See —Risk Factors—Market Risk—The consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this Annual Report 2023 have been prepared on a going concern basis as a result of the\nongoing war between Russia and Ukraineand Note 23—Basis of Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of our\nAudited Consolidated Financial Statements for our going concern disclosure.\nBelow is the reconciliation of capital expenditures (excluding licenses and right-of-use assets) to cash flows used to\nPurchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets:\n(In millions of U.S. dollars) 2023 2022\nCapital expenditures (excluding licenses and right-of-use assets) * 631 836\nAdjusted for:\nAdditions of licenses 4 525\nDifference in timing between accrual and payment for capital expenditures (excluding licenses and\nright-of-use assets) 108 (371)\nPurchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 743 990\n* Refer to Note 2—Segment information of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements\nQuantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nFor information on quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see—Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk.\nResearch and Development\nWe now have the capacity to launch 4G/LTE services in each of our reportable segments. We have acquired new\nspectrum in several operating companies to boost our network capacity, enhance spectral efficiency and enable the launch of\nnew radio access networks technologies. For a discussion of the risks associated with new technology, see - Risk Factors—\nMarket Risks—We may be unable to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards, which could harm\nour competitive position and, in turn, materially harm our business.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into transactions with related parties and affiliates. See -—Related Party Transactions and Note 21—\nRelated Parties and Note 22—Events After the Reporting Period—Agreement with Impact Investments LLC for Strategic Support\nand Board Advisory Service to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n139\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest\nrates on our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the largest currency exposure risks for our group were in relation to the Pakistani rupee, the\nBangladeshi taka, the Ukrainian hryvnia, the Kazakhstani tenge and the Uzbekistani som, because the majority of our cash flows\nfrom operating activities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are denominated in each of these local\ncurrencies, respectively, while our debt, if not incurred in or hedged to the aforementioned currencies, is primarily denominated in\nU.S. dollars.\nWe hold approximately 72% of our cash and bank deposits in U.S. dollars in order to hedge against the risk of local\ncurrency devaluation.\nTo reduce balance sheet currency mismatches, we hold part of our debt in Pakistani rupee, Bangladeshi taka and other\ncurrencies, as well as selectively enter into foreign exchange derivatives. Nonetheless, if the U.S. dollar value of the Pakistani\nrupee, the Bangladeshi taka, the Uzbekistani som, the Kazakhstani tenge were to dramatically decline, it could negatively impact\nour ability to repay or refinance our U.S. dollar denominated indebtedness as well as could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn accordance with our policies, we do not enter into any treasury transactions of a speculative nature.\nFor more information regarding our translation of foreign currency-denominated amounts into U.S. dollars and our\nexposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, see —Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—\nFactors Affecting Comparability and Results of Operations—Foreign Currency Translation and Note 18—Financial Risk\nManagement to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur treasury function has developed risk management policies that establish guidelines for limiting foreign currency\nexchange rate risk. For more information on risks associated with currency exchange rates, including those associated with the\nongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, see — Risk Factors—Market Risks—We are exposed to foreign currency exchange\nloss, fluctuation and translation risks, including as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.\nThe following table summarizes information, as of December 31, 2023, regarding the maturity of the part of our bank\nloans and bonds for which the foreign exchange revaluation directly affects our reported profit or loss:\nAggregate nominal amount of bank loans and Fair Value as\nbonds denominated in foreign currency of December\noutstanding as of December 31, 31,\n2023 2024 2025 2023\nTotal debt:\nFixed Rate (in US$ millions) 209 209 15 246\nAverage interest rate 6% 6% 8% —\nTOTAL 209 209 15 246\nAs of December 31, 2023, the variable interest rate risk on the financing of our group was significant as 54% of the\ngroup’s bank loans and bonds portfolio was fixed rate debt.\nFor more information on our market risks and financial risk management for derivatives and other financial instruments,\nsee Note 16—Investments, Debt and Derivatives and Note 18—Financial Risk Management to our Audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n140\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n141\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nConsolidated Income Statement........................................................................................................................................... 143\nConsolidated Statement Of Comprehensive Income...................................................................................................... 144\nConsolidated Statement Of Financial Position................................................................................................................. 145\nConsolidated Statement Of Changes In Equity................................................................................................................. 146\nConsolidated Statement Of Cash Flows............................................................................................................................. 147\nGeneral Information About The Group................................................................................................................................ 148\n1.....

(“VEON”, the “Company”, and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Group” or “we”) was\nestablished as a private company with limited liability under the laws of the Netherlands on June 29, 2009. The registered office\nand principal place of business of VEON is located at Claude Debussylaan 88, 1082 MD Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The\nCompany is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of VEON Ltd.\nVEON generates revenue from the provision of voice, data and other telecommunication services through a range of wireless,\nfixed and broadband internet services, as well as selling equipment, infrastructure and accessories.\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorized by the Board of Directors for issuance on November 20, 2024.\nThe consolidated financial statements prepared for Dutch statutory purposes for the year ended December 31, 2022 were\nauthorized by the Board of Directors for issuance on June 29, 2023. After the issuance of those financial statements, the\nCompany discovered an error in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with respect to the de-recognition of non-\ncontrolling interest for the sale of its Algerian operations (refer to Note 10 for further details) which was corrected in the financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 24 for further details.\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars (“U.S. dollar” or “US$”). In these Notes, U.S.\ndollar amounts are presented in millions, except for share amounts and as otherwise indicated.\nDue to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, material uncertainties have been identified that may cast significant doubt\non the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern which are discussed in detail in Note 23 of these consolidated financial\nstatements.\nMajor developments during the year ended December 31, 2023\nCompletion of Sale of Russian operations\nOn October 9, 2023, VEON announced the completion of its exit from Russia with closing of the sale of its Russian operations.\nOn September 13, 2023, VEON and the buyer agreed on certain amendments to the Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) which\nhad no material impact on the economic terms of the original transaction announced on November 24, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, VimpelCom independently purchased US$2,140 equivalent of VEON Holdings\nbonds (based on applicable foreign exchange rates on the relevant purchase dates) in order to satisfy certain Russian regulatory\nobligations. VEON Holdings redeemed US$406 of these notes from VimpelCom following their maturity in September 2023.\nUpon the completion of the sale of our Russian Operations, VEON Holdings bonds representing a nominal value of US$1,576\nwhich were acquired by VimpelCom were transferred to Unitel LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) and offset\nagainst the purchase consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294 on October 9, 2023) on a non cash basis\nresulting in no impact on our cash flows.\nThe remaining deferred consideration of US$72 as of December 31, 2023 was offset against VEON Holdings bonds acquired by\nVimpelCom representing a nominal value of US$72, in July 2024, in compliance with applicable regulatory licensing after\nreceiving the relevant regulatory approvals. In addition, there was a US$11 receivable against the sale of towers in Russia\nrecognized in prior periods that was also assigned to the Company as part of the sale transaction. Refer to Note 23 for further\ndetails.\nThe financial impact of the sale of our Russian operations is a loss of US$3,746 recorded within (Loss) / Profit after Tax from\nDiscontinued Operations” in the Consolidated Income Statement, primarily due to US$3,414 of cumulative currency translation\nlosses which accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income and recycled through the consolidated income\nstatement on the date of the disposal. Overall, the sale of the Russian Operations resulted in significant deleveraging of VEON’s\nbalance sheet. For further details, refer to Note 10.\nAgreement between Banglalink and Summit Towers Limited (“Summit”) regarding the sale of its Bangladesh tower\nassets\nOn November 15, 2023, VEON announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Banglalink, entered into an Asset Sale and\nPurchase Agreement (“APA”) and Master Tower Agreement (“MTA”), to sell a portion of its tower portfolio (2012 towers, nearly\none-third of Banglalink's infrastructure portfolio) in Bangladesh to the buyer, Summit, for BDT 11 billion (US$97). The closing of\nthe transaction was subject to regulatory approval which was received on December 21, 2023. Subsequently, the deal closed on\nDecember 31, 2023. Under the terms of the deal, Banglalink entered into a long-term lease agreement with Summit under which\nBanglalink will lease space upon the sold towers for a period of 12 years, with up to seven optional renewal periods of 10 years\neach. The lease agreement became effective upon the closing of the sale.\nAs of November 15, 2023, the Bangladesh towers were classified as assets held for sale. Following the classification as disposal\ngroup held-for-sale, the Company did not account for depreciation and amortization expenses of the Bangladesh tower assets.\nAs a result of the closing of the sale on December 31, 2023, control of the towers was transferred to Summit and Banglalink\nrecognized the purchase consideration of BDT 11 billion (US$97) net of cost of disposals containing legal, regulatory and\ninvestment bankers costs amounting BDT 855 million (US$8). The consideration was receivable as of December 31, 2023, and\n148\npayment was subsequently received in January 2024 upon the final completion date under the terms of the APA. As a result of\napplying sale and leaseback accounting principles to the lease agreement under the terms of the deal, Banglalink recognized a\ngain on sale of assets of BDT 4 billion (US$34), right-of-use assets of BDT 550 million (US$5) representing the proportional fair\nvalue of assets (towers) retained with respect to the book value of assets (towers) sold amounting to BDT 950 million (US$9) and\nlease liabilities of BDT 6 billion (US$52) based on a 12 year lease term, which are at market rates. Additional right-of-use assets\nand lease liabilities of BDT 4 billion (US$40) were recognized for total right-of-use assets of BDT 5 billion (US$45) and total lease\nliabilities of BDT 10 billion (US$92). Refer to Note 9 for further details.\nCybersecurity Incident in Ukraine\nOn December 12, 2023, VEON announced that the network of its Ukrainian subsidiary Kyivstar had been the target of a\nwidespread external cyber-attack causing a technical failure. This resulted in a temporary disruption of Kyivstar's network and\nservices, interrupting the provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and fixed networks, international roaming, and SMS\nservices, amongst others, for Kyivstar customers in Ukraine and abroad. The Company’s technical teams, working relentlessly\nand in collaboration with the Ukrainian law enforcement and government agencies and the Security Service of Ukraine, restored\nservices in multiple stages starting with voice and data connectivity. On December 19, 2023, VEON announced that Kyivstar had\nrestored services in all categories of its communication services, and that mobile voice and internet, fixed connectivity and SMS\nservices as well as the MyKyivstar self-care application were active and available across Ukraine.\nAfter stabilizing the network, although there was no legal obligation to do so, Kyivstar immediately launched offers to thank its\ncustomers for their loyalty, initiating a “Free of Charge” program offering one month of free services on certain types of contracts.\nFurthermore, on December 21, 2023, Kyivstar announced a donation of UAH 100 million (US$3) would be made towards\nUkrainian charity initiatives.\nLargely due to the limited period during which the critical services were down, there was no material financial impact on our\nconsolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to these service disruptions, or due to costs associated with\nadditional IT capabilities required for restoring services, replacing lost equipment or compensating external consultants and\npartners in 2023. The incident had a significant impact on consolidated revenue results for the six-months ended June 30, 2024\nassociated with the revenue loss arising from the customer loyalty measures taken by Kyivstar in order to compensate for the\ninconvenience caused during the disruptions. The impact of these offers on operating revenue in 2024 was US$46. VEON\nexpects no further impact on its financial results arising from the customer loyalty measures under the retention programs, which\nended during the first half of 2024.\nVEON and Kyivstar conducted a thorough investigation, together with outside cybersecurity firms, to determine the full nature,\nextent and impact of the incident and to implement additional security measures to protect against any recurrence. The Ukrainian\ngovernment also conducted an investigation to support the recovery efforts. All investigations were concluded as of June 30,\n2024, and has resulted in an in depth analysis into details of how the attack was executed and how this can be prevented in the\nfuture.\nKyivstar has initiated remediation and mitigation actions to reduce current risks and establish a robust framework to manage\nevolving cyber threats, protect business continuity and maintain customer trust by investing in immediate response actions,\nenhanced security infrastructure, proactive threat management, compliance with cybersecurity regulations and standards,\nemployee awareness, and long-term adaptive measures. Further, VEON Group has executed a group-wide assessment of\ncybersecurity maturity in alignment with the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework 2.0\n(NIST2).\nVEON’s Scheme of arrangement\nFollowing the announcement made by VEON on November 24, 2022 to launch a scheme of arrangement to extend the\nmaturity of the 2023 Notes (the 5.95% notes due February 2023 and 7.25% notes due April 2023), the initial proposed scheme\nwas amended on January 11, 2023 and on January 24, 2023, the Scheme Meeting was held and the amended Scheme was\napproved by 97.59% of the Scheme creditors present and voting.\nOn January 30, 2023, VEON announced that the Scheme Sanction Hearing had taken place, at which the Court made an order\nsanctioning the Scheme in respect of VEON Holdings’ 2023 Notes (the “Order”). On January 31, 2023, VEON confirmed that the\nOrder had been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The amendments to the 2023 Notes were subject to the receipt of\nrelevant licenses to become effective, at which time the maturity dates of the February 2023 and April 2023 notes would be\namended to October and December 2023, respectively.\nOn April 3, 2023, VEON announced that each of the conditions had been satisfied in accordance with the terms of the Scheme,\nincluding receipt of all authorizations and/or licenses necessary to implement the amendments to the 2023 Notes (as set out in\nthe Scheme). On April 4, 2023, the Scheme became effective.\nPursuant to the amendments, Noteholders were entitled to payment of an amendment fee of 200bps payable on the 2023 Notes\noutstanding on their respective amended maturity dates and a put right was granted requiring VEON Holdings to repurchase\n2023 Notes held by 2023 Noteholders exercising such right, at a purchase price of 102% of the principal amount (“2023 Put\nOption”), together with accrued and unpaid interest. The 2023 Put Option closed on April 19, 2023 with holders of US$165 of the\nOctober 2023 Notes and holders of US$294 of the December 2023 Notes exercising the 2023 Put Option. The aggregate put\noption premium paid was US$9. The 2023 Put Option was settled on April 26, 2023. The remaining October 2023 notes were\nrepaid at maturity including an amendment fee of US$ 1. The notes maturing in December 2023 were called earlier and repaid\non September 27, 2023, including an amendment fee of US$1. For further details, refer to further discussion in Note 16.\n149\nVEON US$1,250 multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement\nOn April 20, 2023, and May 30, 2023, the outstanding amounts under our RCF facility were rolled over until October 2023 for\nUS$692 and November 2023 for US$363. These outstanding amounts were further rolled over until January 2024 for US$692\nand February 2024 for US$363. We subsequently repaid and canceled our RCF facility in March 2024.\nU.S. Treasury expands general license to include both VEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings B.V.\nOn January 18, 2023, VEON announced that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\nreplaced the General License 54 originally issued on November 18, 2022 with General License 54A to now include both VEON\nLtd. and VEON Holdings B.V. (VEON Holdings).\nThis general license authorizes all transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to the purchase and receipt of any debt or\nequity securities of VEON Ltd. or VEON Holdings B.V. that would otherwise be prohibited by section 1(a)(i) of Executive Order\n(E.O.) 14071. OFAC General License 54A applies to all debt and equity securities of VEON Ltd. or VEON Holdings B.V. that\nwere issued before June 6, 2022, and confirms that the authorization applies not only to the purchase and receipt of debt and\nequity securities, but also to transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to facilitating, clearing, and settling of such\ntransactions. This General License ensures that all market participants can trade the relevant securities with confidence that\nsuch trading is consistent with E.O. 14071, which targeted “new investment” in Russia.\nFreezing of corporate rights in Kyivstar\nOn October 6, 2023, the Security Services of Ukraine (SSU) announced that the Ukrainian courts were seizing all “corporate\nrights” of Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and Andriy Kosogov in 20 Ukrainian companies that these individuals beneficially own,\nwhile criminal proceedings, unrelated to Kyivstar or VEON, were in progress. This announcement was incorrectly characterized\nby some Ukrainian media as a “seizure” or “freezing” of “Kyivstar’s assets” as the assets of Kyivstar had not been seized or\nfrozen and the court’s ruling did not impact the assets of Kyivstar directly. On October 9, 2023, Ukrainian media further reported,\nwith a headline which incorrectly targeted Kyivstar, that the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine was separately finalizing a lawsuit in the\nUkraine High Anti-Corruption Court to confiscate any Ukrainian assets of M. Fridman. Subsequent clarification by the SSU noted\nthat “The seizure of corporate rights of Ukrainian companies does not affect the protection of the interests of foreign investors\nand owners of shares of corporate rights, does not hinder their economic activity and the possibility of receiving dividends.” We\nhave received notification from our local custodian that 47.85% of Kyivstar shares have been blocked, which will prevent any\ntransaction involving our Kyivstar shares, including transfer of such shares, from proceeding. On October 30, 2023 VEON\nannounced that VEON Ltd. and VEON Holdings B.V. had filed two appeals with the relevant Kyiv court of appeals, challenging\nthe freezing of the corporate rights in Kyivstar, noting that corporate rights in Kyivstar belong exclusively to VEON and that their\nfull or partial seizure directly violates the rights of VEON and its international debt and equity investors, and requesting the lifting\nof the freezing of its corporate rights in Kyivstar. In December 2023, the court rejected our appeals. On June 4, 2024, the CEO of\nVEON, in his capacity as a shareholder of VEON, filed a motion with Shevchenkiv District Court of Kyiv requesting cancellation\nof the seizure of corporate rights in the VEON group's subsidiary Ukraine Tower Company. On June 26, 2024, the motion was\nsupplemented to request cancellation of the seizure of corporate rights in the VEON group's other Ukrainian subsidiaries:\nKyivstar, Kyivstar.Tech and Helsi. VEON is continuing significant government affairs efforts to protect our assets in Ukraine.\nRestrictions applicable in Ukraine to all foreign-owned companies have already led to restrictions on the upstreaming of\ndividends from Ukraine to VEON. Additionally, to the extent that VEON and/or Kyivstar are deemed to be controlled by persons\nsanctioned in Ukraine, potential prohibitions on renting property and land, on participating in public procurement and on the\ntransfer of technology and intellectual property rights to Kyivstar from VEON impacting B2G revenue would also apply.\nBased on the above development, VEON assessed whether the court order and subsequent motions result in an event that\nVEON has lost control over its Ukrainian subsidiary (“Kyivstar”) and concluded that, under the requirements of relevant reporting\nstandards (IFRS 10, Consolidated financial Statements), VEON continues to control Kyivstar and as such, will continue to\nconsolidate Kyivstar in these financial statements.\nShare-based payment awards in VEON Ltd.\nOn February 21, 2023, VEON Ltd. announced the completion of the transfer of 52,550 shares in VEON Ltd. to Joop Brakenhoff.\nA total of 104,047 common VEON Ltd. shares vested as part of VEON Ltd.’s 2021 Deferred Share Plan in 2022.

The Company is currently reviewing the findings and Banglalink\nmay challenge certain proposed penalties and interest which may result in adjustments to the final amount to be paid by\nBanglalink. Should Banglalink and the BTRC not be able to reach a mutually agreed position concerning the audit findings,\nprotracted litigation may result. The Company has accrued for amounts of the claim where it considers a cash outflow to be\nprobable.\nSubsequently, Banglalink had a meeting with BTRC officials and agreed to pay amounts pertaining to 2G matters (already\naccrued BDT 2,200 million in the financials) in BDT 500 million immediately in July 2023 and 12 equal monthly installments of\nBDT 146 million (approximately US$1.4), accordingly Banglalink has paid BDT 500 million (approximately US$5) in July 2023\nand all installments until December 2023 as agreed.\nDespite having objections to the audit findings, in compliance with the instruction given by the BTRC on November 5, 2023 to\npay the principal amount of the BTRC’s audit demand within 10 working days, Banglalink deposited BDT 1,657 million (US$16\nmillion) to the BTRC on November 19, 2023.

Management does not analyze assets or liabilities by reportable segments.\nReportable segments consist of Pakistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Bangladesh for 2023 and 2022 (in 2021, Russia\nwas also considered a reportable segment). Following the announcement to sell the Russian operations on November 24, 2022,\nthe Russian operations were classified as discontinued operations and accounted for as an “Asset held for sale” in line with IFRS\n5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, requirements. The sale of our Russian operations was\ncompleted on October 9, 2023. Additionally, following the exercise of the related put option on July 1, 2021, the Algerian\noperations were classified as a discontinued operation and accounted for as an “Asset held for sale” in line with the IFRS 5\nrequirements. The sale of our stake in the Algerian operations was completed on August 5, 2022.

VAS includes short messages,\nmultimedia messages, caller number identification, call waiting, data transmission, mobile internet, downloadable content, mobile\nfinance services, machine-to-machine and other services. The content revenue relating to VAS is presented net of related costs\nwhen VEON’s performance obligation is to arrange the provision of the services by another party (VEON acts as an agent), and\ngross when VEON is primarily responsible for fulfilling the obligation to provide such services to the customer.\nRevenue for services with a fixed term, including fixed-term tariff plans and monthly subscriptions, is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over time. For pay-as-you-use plans, in which the customer is charged based on actual usage, revenue is recognized on a\nusage basis. Some tariff plans allow customers to rollover unused services to the following period. For such tariff plans, revenue\nis generally recognized on a usage basis.\nFor contracts which include multiple service components (such as voice, text, data), revenue is allocated based on stand-alone\nselling price of each performance obligation. The stand-alone selling price for these services is usually determined with reference\nto the price charged per service under a pay-as-you-use plan to similar customers.\n154\nUpfront fees, including activation or connection fees, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. For contracts\nwith an indefinite term (for example, prepaid contracts), revenue from upfront fees is recognized over the average customer life.\nRevenue from other operators, including interconnect and roaming charges, is recognized based on the price specified in the\ncontract, net of any estimated retrospective volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the\ndiscounts.\nAll service revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered.\nSale of equipment and accessories\nEquipment and accessories are usually sold to customers on a stand-alone basis, or together with service bundles. Where sold\ntogether with service bundles, revenue is allocated pro-rata, based on the stand-alone selling price of the equipment and the\nservice bundle.\nThe vast majority of equipment and accessories sales pertain to mobile handsets and accessories. Revenue for mobile handsets\nand accessories is recognized when the equipment is sold to a customer, or, if sold via an intermediary, when the intermediary\nhas taken control of the device and the intermediary has no remaining right of return. Revenue for fixed-line equipment is not\nrecognized until installation and testing of such equipment are completed and the equipment is accepted by the customer.\nAll revenue from sale of equipment and accessories is recognized at a point in time.\nContract balances\nReceivables and unbilled receivables mostly relate to amounts due from other operators and postpaid customers. Unbilled\nreceivables are transferred to Receivables when the Group issues an invoice to the customer.\nContract liabilities, often referred to as ‘Deferred revenue’, relate primarily to non-refundable cash received from prepaid\ncustomers for fixed-term tariff plans or pay-as-you-use tariff plans. Contract liabilities are presented as ‘Long-term deferred\nrevenue’, ‘Short-term deferred revenue’ and ‘Customer advances’ in Note 6. All current contract liabilities outstanding at the\nbeginning of the year are recognized as revenue during the year.\nCustomer acquisition costs\nCertain incremental costs that are incurred in acquiring a contract with a customer (“customer acquisition costs”) and are\nconsidered recoverable are deferred in the consolidated statement of financial position, within 'Other assets' (see Note 6). Such\ncosts generally relate to commissions paid to third-party dealers and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average\ncustomer life within ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’.\nThe Group applies the practical expedient available for customer acquisition costs for which the amortization would have been\nshorter than 12 months. Such costs relate primarily to commissions paid to third parties upon top-up of prepaid credit by\ncustomers and sale of top-up cards.\nSOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\nAverage customer life\nManagement estimates the average customer life for revenue (such as upfront fees) from contracts with an indefinite term and\nfor customer acquisition costs. The average customer life is calculated based on historical data, specifically churn rates which\nare impacted by relevant country or market characteristics, customer demographic and the nature and terms of the product (such\nas mobile and fixed line, prepaid and postpaid).\n155\n4 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consisted of the following items for the years ended December 31:\n2023 2022\nNetwork and IT costs 487 490\nPersonnel costs 348 339\nCustomer associated costs 386 347\nLosses on receivables 14 27\nTaxes, other than income taxes 60 29\nOther 189 165\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses 1,484 1,397\nIn 2022, our subsidiary in Pakistan recorded a reversal of PKR 13.8 billion (US$63 million) in customer associated costs, relating\nto the reversal of a provision following a favorable decision from the Islamabad High Court on pending litigation.\nLEASES\nShort-term leases and leases for low value items are immediately expensed as incurred.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCustomer associated costs\nCustomer associated costs relate primarily to commissions paid to third-party dealers and marketing expenses. Certain dealer\ncommissions are initially capitalized within ‘Other Assets’ in the consolidated statement of financial position and subsequently\namortized within \"Customer associated costs\".

The provision matrix is based on the historical credit loss experience over the life\nof the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates if relevant. The provision matrix is reviewed on a quarterly\nbasis.

The NBR alleged that Banglalink\nevaded SIM tax on new SIM cards by issuing them as replacements. On the basis of 5 random SIM card purchases made by the\nNBR, the NBR concluded that all SIM card replacements issued by Banglalink between June 2009 and December 2011\n(7,021,834 in total) were new SIM connections and subject to tax. Similar notices were sent to three other operators in\nBangladesh. Banglalink and the other operators filed separate petitions in the High Court, which stayed enforcement of the\ndemands.\nIn an attempt to assist the NBR in resolving the dispute, the Government ordered the NBR to form a Review Committee\ncomprised of the NBR, the Commissioner of Taxes (“LTU”), BTRC, Association of Mobile Telecom Operators of Bangladesh and\nthe operators (including Banglalink). The Review Committee identified a methodology to determine the amount of unpaid SIM tax\n160\nand, after analyzing 1,200 randomly selected SIM cards issued by Banglalink, determined that only 4.83% were incorrectly\nregistered as replacements. The Review Committee’s interim report was signed off by all the parties, however, the Convenor of\nthe Review Committee reneged on the interim report and unilaterally published a final report that was not based on the interim\nreport or the findings of the Review Committee. The operators objected to the final report.\nThe NBR Chairman and operators’ representative agreed that the BTRC would prepare further guidelines for verification of SIM\nusers. Although the BTRC submitted its guidelines (under which Banglalink’s exposure was determined to be 8.5% of the original\ndemand), the Convenor of the Review Committee submitted a supplementary report which disregarded the BTRC’s guidelines\nand assessed Banglalink’s liability for SIM tax to be BDT 7.62 billion (US$69). The operators refused to sign the supplementary\nreport.\nOn May 18, 2015, Banglalink received an updated demand from the LTU claiming Banglalink had incorrectly issued 6,887,633\nSIM cards as replacement SIM cards between June 2009 and December 2011 and required Banglalink to pay BDT 5.32 billion\n(US$48) in SIM tax. The demand also stated that interest may be payable. Similar demands were sent to the other operators.\nOn June 25, 2015, Banglalink filed an application to the High Court to stay the updated demand, and a stay was granted. On\nAugust 13, 2015, Banglalink filed its appeal against the demand before the Appellate Tribunal and deposited 10% of the amount\ndemanded in order to proceed. The other operators also appealed their demands. On May 26, 2016, Banglalink presented its\nlegal arguments and on September 28, 2016, the appeals of all the operators were heard together.\nThe Appellate Tribunal rejected the appeal of Banglalink and all other operators on June 22, 2017. On July 11, 2017, Banglalink\nfiled an appeal of the Appellate Tribunal’s judgement with the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The\nappeal is pending.\nSIM Cards Issued July 2012 to June 2015\nOn November 20, 2017, the LTU issued a final demand to Banglalink for BDT 1.69 billion (US$15) for unpaid tax on SIM card\nreplacements issued by Banglalink between July 2012 and June 2015. On February 20, 2018, Banglalink filed its appeal against\nthis demand before the Appellate Tribunal and deposited 10% of the amount demanded in order to proceed. By its judgement\ndated February 10, 2020, the Appellate Tribunal rejected Banglalink’s appeal. Banglalink appealed to the High Court Division.\nBefore hearing the appeal, the Court suo moto took up as a preliminary question whether, based on new law, the matter is\nsubject to an appeal or an application for revision. On March 2, 2021, the Court determined that an application for revision is the\ncorrect procedure and dismissed the appeal. Banglalink filed an appeal before the Appellate Division and the appeal is pending\nfor hearing. If the Appellate Division rejects the appeal, then Banglalink will be obligated to deposit 10% of the disputed amount\nin order to continue its challenge.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded a provision, for the cases discussed above of, US$8 (2022: US$8).\nOther contingencies and uncertainties\nIn addition to the individual matters mentioned above, the Company is involved in other disputes, litigation and regulatory\ninquiries and both internal and external investigations, both pending and threatened, in the ordinary course of its business. For\nexample, our operating company in Bangladesh has recently been subject to an extensive audit conducted by the BTRC\nconcerning past compliance with all relevant license terms, laws and regulations for the period covering 1996 (inception of our\noperating company in Bangladesh) to December 2019. On June 26, 2023, the BTRC released its audit findings and issued a\nclaim of BDT 8,231 million (approximately US$74) which includes BDT 4,307 million (approximately US$39) for interest. The\nCompany has paid the principal amount and is currently having discussions with government stakeholders, including the BTRC\nfor removal of the interest amount. Should Banglalink and the BTRC not be able to reach a mutually agreed position concerning\nthe removal of the interest amount, protracted litigation may result. The Company has accrued for amounts of the claim where it\nconsiders a cash outflow to be probable. The total value of all other individual contingencies that are able to be quantified and\nare above US$5, other than disclosed above and in Note 8, amounts to US$205 (2022: US$289). Due to the high level of\nestimation uncertainty, as described in ‘Source of estimation uncertainty’ in this Note 7 and in Note 8, it is not practicable for the\nCompany to reliably estimate the financial effect for certain contingencies and uncertainties and therefore no financial effect has\nbeen included within the preceding disclosure. The Company does not expect any liability or other financial impact (e.g.\nregarding recoverability of certain receivables) arising from these contingencies and uncertainties to have a material effect on the\nresults of operations, liquidity, capital resources or financial position of the Company. Furthermore, the Company believes it has\nprovided for all probable liabilities.\nFor the ongoing matters described above, where the Company has concluded that the potential loss arising from a negative\noutcome in the matter cannot be reliably estimated, the Company has not recorded an accrual for the potential loss. However, in\nthe event a loss is incurred, it may have an adverse effect on the results of operations, liquidity, capital resources, or financial\nposition of the Company.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event it is\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable\nestimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate if the time value of\nmoney is significant. Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising from past events, whose existence will be confirmed\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.\n161\nSOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\nThe Group is involved in various legal proceedings, internal and external investigations, disputes and claims, including regulatory\ndiscussions related to the Group’s business, licenses, tax positions and investments, and the outcomes of these are subject to\nsignificant uncertainty. Management evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the\nability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Unanticipated events or changes in these factors may require the\nGroup to increase or decrease the amount recorded for a matter that has not been previously recorded because it was not\nconsidered probable and /or the impact could not be estimated (no reasonable estimate could be made).\nIn the ordinary course of business, VEON may be party to various legal and tax proceedings, including as it relates to\ncompliance with the rules of the telecom regulators in the countries in which VEON operates, competition law and anti-bribery\nand corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). Non-compliance with such rules and laws may\ncause VEON to be subject to claims, some of which may relate to the developing markets and evolving fiscal and regulatory\nenvironments in which VEON operates. In the opinion of management, VEON’s liability, if any, in all pending litigation, other legal\nproceeding or other matters, other than what is discussed in this Note, will not have a material effect upon the financial condition,\nresults of operations or liquidity of VEON.\n162\n8 INCOME TAXES\nCurrent income tax is the expected tax expense, payable or receivable on taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates\nenacted or substantively enacted at reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\nIncome tax payable\nCurrent income tax payable consisted of the following items as of December 31:\n2023 2022\nCurrent tax payable 58 46\nUncertain tax provisions 93 133\nTotal income tax payable 151 179\nIn addition to the above balance of uncertain tax provisions we have also recognized uncertain tax provisions which have been\ndirectly offset with available losses.\nVEON is involved in a number of disputes, litigation and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of its business, pertaining\nto income tax claims. The total value of these individual contingencies that are able to be quantified amounts to US$216 (2022:\nUS$124). Due to the high level of estimation uncertainty, as described in ‘Source of estimation uncertainty’ disclosed below in\nthis Note 8, it is not practicable for the Company to reliably estimate the financial effect for certain contingencies and therefore no\nfinancial effect has been included within the preceding disclosure. The Company does not expect any liability arising from these\ncontingencies to have a material effect on the results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or financial position of the\nCompany, however we note that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the specific matters could have a material adverse\nimpact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of\nrelevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the\nfuture. For further details with respect to VEON’s uncertain tax provisions and tax risks, please refer to the ‘Accounting policies’\nand ‘Source of estimation uncertainty’ disclosed below.\nIncome tax assets\nThe Company reported current income tax assets of US$58 (2022: US$70).\nThese tax assets mainly relate to advance tax payments in our operating companies which can only be offset against income tax\nliabilities in that relevant jurisdiction, in fiscal periods subsequent to the balance sheet date.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense consisted of the following for the years ended December 31:\n2023 2022\nCurrent income taxes\nCurrent year 241 268\nAdjustments in respect of previous years 14 10\nTotal current income taxes 255 278\nDeferred income taxes\nMovement of temporary differences and losses (58) (8)\nChanges in tax rates (4) (4)\nChanges in recognized deferred tax assets* (20) (162)\nAdjustments in respect of previous years 1 (5)\nOther (1) (32)\nTotal deferred tax benefit (82) (211)\nIncome tax expense 173 67\n*In 2022, the increase of deferred tax assets is mainly driven by recognition of previously unrecognized historic losses due to positive outlook and\nbusiness developments in our Bangladesh operations.\n163\nEffective tax rate\nThe table below outlines the reconciliation between the statutory tax rate in the Netherlands of (25.8%) (2022 the statutory rate\nwas 25.8%) and the effective income tax rates for the Group, together with the corresponding amounts, for the years ended\nDecember 31:\n2023 2022 Explanatory notes\nProfit before tax from continuing\n749 998\noperations\nIncome tax expense at statutory\n(193) (257)\ntax rate (25.8%)\nDifference due to the effects of:\nCertain jurisdictions in which VEON operates have income tax rates which are\ndifferent to the Dutch statutory tax rate of 25.8% (25.8% in 2022). Profitability\nDifferent tax rates in different\n62 47 in countries with lower tax rates (i.e. Kazakhstan, Ukraine) has a positive\njurisdictions\nimpact on the effective tax rate, partially offset with profitability in countries\nwith higher rate (i.e. Pakistan, Bangladesh).\nThe Group incurs certain expenses which are non-deductible in the relevant\njurisdictions. In 2023 and 2022, such expenses mainly include intra-group\nNon-deductible expenses (45) (35)\nexpenses (i.e. interest on internal loans), certain non-income tax charges (i.e.\nminimum tax regimes) and other.\nIn 2023, the non-taxable income is mainly driven by the non-taxable FOREX\ngains incurred by Dutch Holdings on sale of subsidiaries of US$25. In 2022,\nNon-taxable income 28 9\nnon-taxable income is mainly driven by reversal of previously unrecognized\nmanagement fees in Uzbekistan.\nIn 2023, the effect of prior year adjustments mainly relates to tax return true-\nups and the effects of 6% Super tax in Pakistan introduced in 2023 which had\nAdjustments in respect of\n(15) (9) a retrospective impact on 2022. In 2022, the effect of prior year adjustments\nprevious years\nmainly relates to tax return true-ups and the effects of 4% Super tax in\nPakistan introduced in 2022 which had a retrospective impact on 2021.\nIn 2023, the movements in (un)recognized deferred tax assets are primarily\ncaused by tax losses and other credits mainly in the Netherlands and\nLuxembourg, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognized. In 2022,\nMovements in (un)recognized the movements primarily relates to holding entities in the Netherlands and\n20 162\ndeferred tax assets deferred tax asset recognition on previously unrecognized losses in\nBangladesh of US$108. The increase of deferred tax assets in Bangladesh is\nmainly driven by recognition of previously unrecognized historic losses due to\npositive outlook and business developments in our Bangladesh operations.\nWithholding taxes are recognized to the extent that dividends from foreign\noperations are expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.

The\nCompany has a deferred tax liability of US$19 (2022: US$29), relating to the tax effect of the undistributed profits that will be\ndistributed in the foreseeable future, primarily in its Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, undistributed earnings of VEON’s foreign subsidiaries (outside the Netherlands) which are indefinitely\ninvested and will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, amounted to US$6,241 (2022: US$6,105). Accordingly, no deferred\ntax liability is recognized for this amount of undistributed profits.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense represents the aggregate amount determined on the profit for the period based on current tax and deferred\ntax. In cases where the tax relates to items that are charged to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, the tax is also\ncharged respectively to other comprehensive income or directly to equity.\nUncertain tax positions\nThe Group’s policy is to comply with the applicable tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which its operations are subject to\nincome taxes. The Group’s estimates of current income tax expense and liabilities are calculated assuming that all tax\ncomputations filed by the Company’s subsidiaries will be subject to a review or audit by the relevant tax authorities. Uncertain tax\npositions are generally assessed individually, using the most likely outcome method. The Company and the relevant tax\nauthorities may have different interpretations of how regulations should be applied to actual transactions (refer below for details\nregarding risks and uncertainties).\n166\nDeferred taxation\nDeferred taxes are recognized using the liability method and thus are computed as the taxes recoverable or payable in future\nperiods in respect of deductible or taxable temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying\namounts in the Company’s financial statements.\nSOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\nTax risks\nThe tax legislation in the markets in which VEON operates is unpredictable and gives rise to significant uncertainties, which\ncould complicate our tax planning and business decisions. Tax laws in many of the emerging markets in which we operate have\nbeen in force for a relatively short period of time as compared to tax laws in more developed market economies. Tax authorities\nin our markets are often less advanced in their interpretation of tax laws, as well as in their enforcement and tax collection\nmethods.\nAny sudden and unforeseen amendments of tax laws or changes in the tax authorities’ interpretations of the respective tax laws\nand/or double tax treaties, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows or the amounts of\ndividends available for distribution to shareholders in a particular period (e.g. introduction of transfer pricing rules, Controlled\nForeign Operation (“CFC”) legislation and more strict tax residency rules).\nManagement believes that VEON has paid or accrued all taxes that are applicable. Where uncertainty exists, VEON has accrued\ntax liabilities based on management’s best estimate. From time to time, we may also identify tax contingencies for which we have\nnot recorded an accrual. Such unaccrued tax contingencies could materialize and require us to pay additional amounts of tax.\nThe potential financial effect of such tax contingencies are disclosed in Note 7 and above in this Note 8, unless not practicable to\ndo so.\nUncertain tax positions\nUncertain tax positions are recognized when it is probable that a tax position will not be sustained. The expected resolution of\nuncertain tax positions is based upon management’s judgement of the likelihood of sustaining a position taken through tax\naudits, tax courts and/or arbitration, if necessary. Circumstances and interpretations of the amount or likelihood of sustaining a\nposition may change through the settlement process. Furthermore, the resolution of uncertain tax positions is not always within\nthe control of the Group and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legal processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in\nwhich the Group operates. Issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.\nRecoverability of deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the assets will be realized. Significant judgement is\nrequired to determine the amount that can be recognized and depends foremost on the expected timing, level of taxable profits,\ntax planning strategies and the existence of taxable temporary differences. Estimates made relate primarily to losses carried\nforward in some of the Group’s foreign operations. When an entity has a history of recent losses, the deferred tax asset arising\nfrom unused tax losses is recognized only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable profit will\nbe generated. Estimated future taxable profit is not considered such evidence unless that entity has demonstrated the ability by\ngenerating significant taxable profit for the current year or there are certain other events providing sufficient evidence of future\ntaxable profit. New transactions and the introduction of new tax rules may also affect judgements due to uncertainty concerning\nthe interpretation of the rules and any transitional rules.\nFuture legislative changes\nPillar Two legislation has been substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions the Group operates. The legislation will be effective\nfor the Group’s financial year beginning January 1, 2024. The Group is in scope of the enacted or substantively enacted\nlegislation and has performed an assessment of the Group’s potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.\nThe assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent tax filings, country-by-country\nreporting and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax\nrates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15%. However, there are a limited number of\njurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief does not apply and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to 15%. The\nGroup does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes in those jurisdictions.\nThe Group has applied the temporary mandatory exception to the requirement to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities\nrelated to Pillar Two income taxes.\nThe Group has accumulated US$6,904 of tax losses and US$122 of other tax attributes in various jurisdictions which can be\ncarried-forward and taken into account for Pillar Two purposes.\n167\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES OF THE GROUP\n9 SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS\nSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS IN 2023\nCompletion of Sale of Russian operations\nOn October 9, 2023, VEON announced the completion of its exit from Russia with closing of the sale of its Russian operations.\nOn September 13, 2023, VEON and the buyer agreed on certain amendments to the Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) which\nhad no material impact on the economic terms of the original transaction announced on November 24, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, VimpelCom independently purchased US$2,140 equivalent of VEON Holdings\nbonds (based on applicable foreign exchange rates on the relevant purchase dates) in order to satisfy certain Russian regulatory\nobligations. VEON Holdings redeemed US$406 of these notes from VimpelCom following their maturity in September 2023.\nUpon the completion of the sale of our Russian Operations, VEON Holdings bonds representing a nominal value of US$1,576\nwhich were acquired by VimpelCom were transferred to Unitel LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) and offset\nagainst the purchase consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294 on October 9, 2023) on a non cash basis\nresulting in no impact on our cash flows.\nThe remaining deferred consideration of US$72 as of December 31, 2023 was offset against VEON Holdings bonds acquired by\nVimpelCom representing a nominal value of US$72, in July 2024, in compliance with applicable regulatory licensing after\nreceiving the relevant regulatory approvals. In addition, there was a US$11 receivable against the sale of towers in Russia\nrecognized in prior periods that was also assigned to the Company as part of the sale transaction. Refer to Note 22 for further\ndetails.\nThe financial impact of the sale of our Russian operations is a loss of US$3,746 recorded within (Loss) / Profit after Tax from\nDiscontinued Operations” in the Consolidated Income Statement, primarily due to US$3,414 of cumulative currency translation\nlosses which accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income and recycled through the consolidated income\nstatement on the date of the disposal. Overall, the sale of the Russian Operations resulted in significant deleveraging of VEON’s\nbalance sheet. For further details, refer to Note 10.\nAgreement between Banglalink and Summit regarding the sale of its Bangladesh tower assets\nOn November 15, 2023, VEON announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Banglalink, entered into an Asset Sale and\nPurchase Agreement (“APA”) and Master Tower Agreement (“MTA”), to sell a portion of its tower portfolio (2012 towers, nearly\none-third of Banglalink's infrastructure portfolio) in Bangladesh to the buyer, Summit, for BDT 11 billion (US$97). The closing of\nthe transaction was subject to regulatory approval which was received on December 21, 2023. Subsequently, the deal closed on\nDecember 31, 2023. Under the terms of the deal, Banglalink entered into a long-term lease agreement with Summit under which\nBanglalink will lease space upon the sold towers for a period of 12 years, with up to seven optional renewal periods of 10 years\neach. The lease agreement became effective upon the closing of the sale.\nAs of November 15, 2023, the Bangladesh towers were classified as assets held for sale. Following the classification as disposal\ngroup held-for-sale, the Company did not account for depreciation and amortization expenses of the Bangladesh tower assets.\nAs a result of the closing of the sale on December 31, 2023, control of the towers was transferred to Summit and Banglalink\nrecognized the purchase consideration of BDT 11 billion (US$97) net of cost of disposals containing legal, regulatory and\ninvestment bankers costs amounting BDT 855 million (US$8). The consideration was receivable as of December 31, 2023, and\npayment was subsequently received in January 2024 upon the final completion date under the terms of the APA. As a result of\napplying sale and leaseback accounting principles to the lease agreement under the terms of the deal, Banglalink recognized a\ngain on sale of assets of BDT 4 billion (US$34), right-of-use assets of BDT 550 million (US$5) representing the proportional fair\nvalue of assets (towers) retained with respect to the book value of assets (towers) sold amounting to BDT 950 million (US$9) and\nlease liabilities of BDT 6 billion (US$52) based on a 12 year lease term, which are at market rates. Additional right-of-use assets\nand lease liabilities of BDT 4 billion (US$40) were recognized for total right-of-use assets of BDT 5 billion (US$45) and total lease\nliabilities of BDT 10 billion (US$92).\nSignificant movements in exchange rates\nAn increase in demand for hard currencies, in part due to the ongoing war in Ukraine (refer to Note 23) and other\nmacroeconomic conditions, resulted in the devaluation of exchange rates in the countries in which VEON operates, particularly in\nPakistan and Russia. While the UAH to USD foreign exchange rate have been relatively stable during 2023 given the ongoing\ncircumstances in Ukraine, there is a continued risk of a significant Ukrainian hryvnia (“UAH”) to USD depreciation. This risk has\nbeen partially mitigated by investment of excess cash in USD denominated domestic Ukrainian sovereign bonds. Refer to Note\n18 for further details on foreign currency risk and Note 16 for further details on the Ukrainian sovereign bonds. As such, in the\ntwelve-months ended December 31, 2023, the book value of assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, in U.S. dollar terms,\ndecreased significantly, with a corresponding loss of US$598 (2022:US$480) recorded against the foreign currency translation\nreserve in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS IN 2022\n168\nAnnounced sale of Russia operationsOn November 24, 2022, VEON entered into an agreement to sell VEON’s Russian\noperations to certain senior members of the management team of VimpelCom, led by the CEO at the time, Aleksander\nTorbakhov. Under the agreement, VEON will receive consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294). The SPA\ncontains provisions amongst others that in the event Vimpelcom acquires VEON Holdings B.V.’s debt in excess of the sales\nconsideration, VEON will work with the purchasers to satisfy its obligations to them as a bondholder. The transaction is subject to\ncertain closing conditions including the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals and licenses from relevant government\nauthorities in Russia and Western jurisdictions (the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Bermuda) for\nthe proposed structure of the sale. As of July 24, 2023, Russian regulatory approvals have been obtained as well as the OFAC\nlicense and required authorizations from the United Kingdom and Bermudan authorities. The remaining closing conditions to be\nsatisfied include any required license from the European Union or any required consent from VEON creditors in order to cancel\nthe debt provided as consideration and/or complete the sale. The transaction is expected to be completed in 2023.\nAs a result of the expected disposal, VEON has classified its Russian operations as held-for-sale and discontinued operations\nupon the signing of the agreement on November 24, 2022. In connection with this classification, the Company no longer\naccounts for depreciation and amortization expenses of the assets of its Russian operations. The results for Russian operations\nin the consolidated income statements and the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were presented\nseparately. For further details of the transaction, refer to Note 10.\nSale of Algeria operations\nOn July 1, 2021, VEON exercised its put option to sell the entirety of its 45.57% stake in its Algerian subsidiary, Omnium Telecom\nAlgerie SpA (Algeria) to the Fonds National d'Investissement (FNI). Omnium owns Algerian mobile network operator, Djezzy.\nUnder the terms of the shareholders' agreement, the transaction was completed on August 5, 2022 for a sales price of US$682\nin cash. For further details of the transaction, refer to Note 10.\nSale of Georgia operations\nOn March 31, 2022, VEON Georgia Holdings B.V. entered into a non-binding share purchase agreement with Miren Invest LLC\n(\"Miren\"), VEON's former local partner, for the sale of VEON Georgia LLC (\"VEON Georgia\"), our operating company in Georgia,\nfor a sales price of US$45 in cash, subject to VEON corporate approvals and regulatory approvals. The required approvals were\nsubsequently obtained and the sale was completed on June 8, 2022.\nOn June 8, 2022, upon completion of the sale to Miren, control of VEON Georgia was transferred to Miren and VEON recognized\na US$94 gain on disposal of VEON Georgia, which includes the recycling of currency translation reserve in the amount of\nUS$78.\nSignificant movements in exchange rates\nAn increase in demand for hard currencies, in part due to the ongoing war in Ukraine as well as macroeconomic conditions in\nPakistan and Bangladesh, resulted in the devaluation of exchange rates in the countries in which VEON operates. As such, in\n2022, the book value of assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, in U.S. dollar terms, decreased significantly, with a\ncorresponding loss of US$486 recorded against the foreign currency translation reserve in the Statement of Comprehensive\nIncome.\n10 HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides the details of assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAssets held-for-sale Liabilities held-for-sale\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nRussia — 5,793 — 4,249\nUkraine towers — 3 — —\nTotal assets and liabilities held for sale — 5,796 — 4,249\n169\nThe following table provides the details of loss after tax from discontinued operations and disposals of discontinued operations\nfor the periods ended December 31:\n2023 2022\nRussia\nProfit / (loss) after tax for the period 916 (161)\nLoss on disposal (3,746) —\nAlgeria\nProfit after tax for the period — 144\nLoss on disposal — (722)\nTotal loss after tax from discontinued operations and disposals of discontinued operations (2,830) (739)\n.\nSale of Russia operations\nOn November 24, 2022, VEON entered into the Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) to sell VEON’s Russian operations to certain\nsenior members of the management team of VimpelCom, led by the CEO at the time, Aleksander Torbakhov. Under the\nagreement, the purchase price consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294 on October 9, 2023), was expected to\nbe settled primarily by VimpelCom taking on and discharging certain VEON Holdings B.V.’s debt, thus significantly deleveraging\nVEON’s balance sheet. The SPA contained provisions amongst others that in the event Vimpelcom acquires VEON Holdings\nB.V.’s debt in excess of the sales consideration, VEON will work with the purchasers to satisfy its obligations to them as a\nbondholder. The transaction was subject to certain closing conditions including the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals and\nlicenses from relevant government authorities in Russia and Western jurisdictions (the United States, the United Kingdom, the\nEuropean Union, and Bermuda) for the proposed structure of the sale.\nOn November 24, 2022, the signing date of the SPA, the Company classified its Russian operations as a disposal group held-for-\nsale and discontinued operations. Following the classification as disposal group held-for-sale, the Company did not account for\ndepreciation and amortization expenses of Russia’s assets.\nOn September 13, 2023, VEON agreed with the buyer, owned by certain senior members of VimpelCom’s management team,\namendments to the SPA, which had no material impact on the economic terms of the original transaction announced on\nNovember 24, 2022. With the amendments to the sale agreement, the entire consideration for the sale was agreed to be\nsatisfied by transferring the agreed value of VEON Holdings bonds acquired by VimpelCom to a wholly owned subsidiary of\nVEON Holdings (Unitel LLC) on or prior to the closing of the sale, which will hold such notes until their cancellation or maturity.\nU.S. and other regulatory approvals were received for the transfer of approximately 95% of such VEON Holdings bonds.\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2023, VimpelCom independently purchased US$2,140 equivalent of the Issuer’s debt\nsecurities in order to satisfy certain Russian regulatory obligations.\nOn October 9, 2023, VEON announced the completion of its exit from Russia with closing of the sale of its Russian operations.\nUpon completion of the sale, control of VimpelCom was transferred to the buyer, and accordingly, a loss of US$3.7 billion\nrecorded within “Profit / (loss) after Tax from Discontinued Operations” in the Consolidated Income Statement was recognized,\nprimarily due to US$3.4 billion of cumulative currency translation losses which accumulated in equity through other\ncomprehensive income and recycled through the consolidated income statement on the date of the disposal. VEON Holdings\nredeemed US$406 of these debt securities from VimpelCom following their maturity. Upon the completion of the sale, the agreed\namount of the bonds of VEON Holdings B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, (\"VEON Holdings\"), acquired by\nVimpelCom representing a nominal value of US$1,576 were transferred to Unitel LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany) and offset against the purchase consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294 on October 9, 2023) on a\nnon cash basis resulting in no impact on the cash flows. The remaining deferred consideration of US$72 as of December 31,\n2023 was offset against VEON Holdings bonds acquired by VimpelCom representing a nominal value of US$72, in July 2024\nafter receiving the relevant regulatory approval.\nThe following table shows the assets and liabilities disposed in 2023 and classified as held-for-sale relating to Russia operations\nas of:\n170\nDecember 31,\nOctober 9, 2023 2022\nProperty and equipment 3,216 3,941\nIntangible assets excl. goodwill 386 356\nGoodwill 155 617\nDeferred tax assets 72 78\nOther non-current assets 1,328 50\nInventories 53 113\nTrade and other receivables 287 368\nOther current assets 839 270\nTotal assets disposed / held for sale 6,336 5,793\nNon-current liabilities\nDebt and Derivatives – NCL 3,641 2,888\nOther non-current liabilities 26 64\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables 494 708\nDebt & Derivatives – CL 233 306\nOther non-financial liabilities 300 283\nTotal liabilities disposed / held for sale 4,694 4,249\nThe following table shows the profit / (loss) and other comprehensive income relating to Russia operations for the periods ended\nDecember 31 and as of date of disposal:\nIncome statement and statement of comprehensive income October 9, 2023 2022\nOperating revenue 2,780 4,263\nOperating expenses ** (1,865) (3,976)\nOther expenses 42 (424)\nProfit / (loss) before tax for the period 957 (137)\nIncome tax expense (41) (24)\nProfit / (loss) after tax for the period 916 (161)\nOther comprehensive loss* (421) (29)\nTotal comprehensive income / (loss) 495 (190)\n*Other comprehensive loss relates to the foreign currency translation of discontinued operations.\n** In 2023, operating expenses includes an impairment of US$281 (2022:US$446) against the carrying value of goodwill in Russia.\n171\nThe following table shows the results for the disposal of the Russia operations that are accounted for in these financials as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\n2023\nSale consideration * 1,294\nCarrying amount of net assets at disposal ** (1,642)\nDe-recognition of non-controlling interest 16\nLoss on sale before reclassification of foreign currency translation reserve (332)\nReclassifications of:\nforeign currency translation reserve (3,384)\nnet investment hedge reserves (30)\n(3,414)\nNet loss on disposal of Russia operations (3,746)\n*As discussed above, the sale consideration was settled in a non-cash transaction via the transfer of bonds held by Vimpelcom to VEON\nHoldings’ subsidiary.\n** Net assets include US$715 relating to cash and cash equivalents at disposal.\nRussia impairment losses 2023\nAs of June 30, 2023, assets and liabilities held-for-sale were assessed for impairment in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current\nAssets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, and valued at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to\nsell. VEON recorded an impairment of US$281 against the carrying value of goodwill in Russia, resulting in a reduced carrying\nvalue of US$168 at the reporting date of which the VEON share amounts to US$152, excluding non-controlling interest.\nThe recoverable amount of the net assets held for sale of US$152 as of June 30, 2023 was determined based on the fair value\nless costs of disposal and represents the remaining portion of the sales proceeds as per SPA (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).\nThis equates to the value of the VEON bonds remaining to be purchased by VimpelCom to reach the sales consideration of RUB\n130 billion.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the carrying value of Russian net assets amounted to US$(165) due to increased external debt. The\nVEON share of net assets amounted to US$(179), excluding non-controlling interest. The sales proceeds as per the SPA of RUB\n130 billion was fully settled upon closing against the receivable held by Vimpelcom for the VEON bonds acquired by VimpelCom\nand subsequently transferred to Unitel LLC. Therefore, the recoverable amount of the net assets, being the remaining portion of\nthe sales proceeds as per SPA (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) to be settled against the net assets, amounted to nil. No\nfurther impairment or reversal was recorded.\nRussia impairment losses 2022\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine started on February 24, 2022 and has impacted our operations in Russia.\nIn response to the events in Ukraine, wide-ranging economic sanctions and trade restrictions were imposed on Russia by the\nUnited States, the European Union (and individual EU member states), the United Kingdom, as well as other countries which\nhave targeted individuals and entities as well as large aspects of the Russian economy, including freezing the assets of Russia’s\ncentral bank, other Russian financial institutions, and individuals, removing selected Russian banks from the Swift banking\nsystem, and curbing certain products exported to Russia. Furthermore, as a response to the imposed sanctions, Russia\nintroduced a number of counter-sanctions aimed at stabilizing domestic financial markets. These, among other things, include\nrestrictions related to capital and foreign exchange controls, restrictions on lending to foreign (non-Russian) persons, restrictions\non foreign persons’ transactions with Russian securities and real estate and limitations on export and import of certain goods into\nand outside Russia.\nThe above factors indicated a trigger that carrying value might be impaired and resulted in an impairment of US$446 against the\ncarrying value of goodwill in Russia as of March 31, 2022, of which, the recoverable amount of the CGU was US$1,886. This\nwas determined based on fair value less costs of disposal calculations (Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy) using a discounted\ncash flow model, based on cash flow projections from business plans prepared by management.\n172\nMarch 31, 2022 *** September 30, 2021\nExplicit Explicit\nforecast Terminal Combined forecast Terminal Combined\nKey assumptions – Russia CGU period period average * period period average *\nDiscount rate — % — % 20.5 % — % — % 9.3 %\nAverage annual revenue growth rate 6.2 % 1.6 % 5.5 % 5.0 % 1.6 % 4.4 %\nAverage operating margin 32.4 % 35.0 % 32.8 % 33.2 % 35.5 % 33.6 %\nAverage CAPEX / revenue ** 20.3 % 18.0 % 19.9 % 25.4 % 21.0 % 24.7 %\n* Combined average for 2022 is based on an explicit forecast period consisting of five years forecast plus the latest estimate for 2022\n(2022-2027), and terminal period in 2028 (for 2020 being 2021-2025 with terminal period 2026); for comparative period 2021 the rates were\nrevised to conform the calculation being 2022-2026 and terminal period in 2027.\n** CAPEX excludes licenses and ROU assets.\n*** The growth rates as of March 31, 2022, in the explicit forecast period and the combined average, were revised to conform the growth rates\napplied in the calculation of the recoverable amount in the first quarter of 2022.\nThe fair value less cost of disposal for Russian operations as of September 30, 2022 (date of the annual impairment test) was\nbased on the expected sales proceeds from third party bids which have been substantiated by the share price consideration of\nRUB 130 billion (approximately US$1,294 million) reflected in the SPA signed on November 24, 2022 (Level 2 in the fair value\nhierarchy).

Omnium owns Algerian mobile network operator, Djezzy.\nUnder the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, the transaction was completed on August 5, 2022 for a cash sale price of\nUS$682 and control of Algeria was transferred to FNI. Refer to the table below for the results of the transaction.\nOn July 1, 2021, the Company classified its operations in Algeria as held-for-sale and discontinued operations. Following the\nclassification as a disposal group held-for-sale, the Company did not account for depreciation and amortization expenses of\nAlgeria assets. On August 5, 2022, the sale was completed and the net assets were disposed.

They\nare measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\nNon-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortized while they are classified\nas held for sale. Assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held-for-sale are presented separately from the other\nassets and liabilities in the statement of financial position without restating the prior period comparatives.\nA discontinued operation is a component that is classified as held-for-sale and that represents a separate major line of business\nor geographical area of operations. Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are\npresented as a single amount in the income statement and cash flow statement within operating, investing and financing\nactivities in the current period and comparative periods. All other notes to the financial statements include amounts for continuing\noperations, unless otherwise mentioned.\n174\n11 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS\nProperty and equipment and intangible assets are tested regularly for impairment. The Company assesses, at the end of each\nreporting period, whether there exists any indicators that an asset may be impaired (i.e., asset becoming idle, damaged or no\nlonger in use). If there are such indicators, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Impairment losses of\ncontinuing operations are recognized in the income statement in a separate line item.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually (at September 30) or when circumstances indicate the carrying value may be\nimpaired. Refer to Note 13 for an overview of the carrying value of goodwill per cash-generating unit (“CGU”). The Company’s\nimpairment test is primarily based on fair value less cost of disposal calculations (Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy) using a\ndiscounted cash flow model, based on cash flow projections from business plans prepared by management. The Company\nconsiders the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, as well as its weighted average cost of capital\nand the quarterly financial performances of each CGU when reviewing for indicators of impairment in interim periods.\nThe CGUs classified as Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operation during 2023 are disclosed in Note 10, including any\ncurrent or past impairment charges recorded for these CGUs.\nImpairment losses / (reversals) in 2023\nProperty and Total\nequipment impairment\n2023\nUkraine 1 1\nOther* (9) (9)\n(8) (8)\n* This includes net impairment reversals on telecommunication equipment in Kazakhstan.\nThe Company performed annual impairment testing of goodwill and for non-goodwill CGUs also tested assets for impairment as\nof September 30, 2023 and subsequently assessed for indicators of impairment or reversal of impairment as of December 31,\n2023. CGU Bangladesh has limited headroom following the reversal of impairment in 2022 and is continuously monitored. Our\nassessment also considered the impact of the cyber-attack in December 2023 on our Ukrainian subsidiary, Kyivstar and the sale\nof the Bangladesh towers also in December 2023 and concluded that no impairment nor reversal of impairment was identified for\nany CGU. For further details of the Ukraine cyber-attack, refer to Note 1 and for details of the Bangladesh tower sale, refer to\nNote 9.\nFor details regarding the assessment of Russia and impairment of assets held for sale, refer to Note 10.\nImpairment losses / (reversals) in 2022\nProperty and Intangible\nequipment assets Goodwill Other Total\n2022\nBangladesh (32) (68) — — (100)\nKyrgyzstan (29) (9) — (11) (49)\nUkraine * 31 1 — — 32\nOther 3 (1) — — 2\n(27) (77) — (11) (115)\n*This includes net impairment to property and equipment as a result of physical damage to sites in Ukraine caused by the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.\nBangladesh CGU\nBangladesh is a non-goodwill CGU, and therefore not subject to the mandatory annual impairment testing. However, in 2018 an\nimpairment loss of US$451 was recognized against the value of the licenses and the network assets. The Company assessed if\nany indicators (“triggers”) existed of an additional impairment or of a decrease of previous impairments and performed valuation\ntests to check if a further impairment or reversal of impairment was required.\nThe current business strategy focused on nation-wide expansion and the significant acquisition of the 4G license showed a\ncontinued revenue growth and balanced expansion of the subscriber base that were taken into account by management for\nbusiness plans of the Bangladesh CGU.\nBased on these revisions, the recoverable amount of US$474 was determined, establishing a headroom of US$119 above\ncarrying value (US$355), of which an amount of US$100 was booked as a reversal of the impairment loss as per September 30,\n2022.\n175\nThe US$100 was reversed against intangible assets (US$68) and property and equipment (US$32). The remaining difference\nbetween the headroom and the amount of reversal of US$19 represents impairment related to assets that have been fully\ndepreciated in the period since the impairment was recognized until September 30, 2022.\nBangladesh CGU is disclosed as Bangladesh reportable segment (refer to Note 2).\nKyrgyzstan CGU\nKyrgyzstan CGU, has no goodwill and is therefore not subject to the mandatory annual goodwill impairment testing. However,\nduring 2020 as a consequence of the unstable political environment and uncertainties arising with respect to the recoverability of\nour operating assets in Kyrgyzstan, VEON fully impaired the carrying value of all operating assets of Kyrgyzstan. As a result, the\nCompany recorded a total impairment loss of US$64.\nAs of September 30, 2022 the Company assessed triggers and performed valuation tests to check if a further impairment or\nreversal of impairment was required.\nBased on this assessment, which reflected that the previous uncertainties were resolved through the acquisition of licenses and\nsettlement of tax litigation, as of September 30, 2022 the recoverable amount of US$25 indicated a headroom of US$51. This\nhas led to reversal of impairment loss as of September 30, 2022 for US$49 against property and equipment (US$29), intangible\nassets (US$9) and other assets (US$11). The remaining US$2 represents impairment related to assets that have been fully\ndepreciated in the period since the impairment was recognized until September 30, 2022.\nKyrgyzstan CGU is disclosed within \"Others\" reportable segment (refer to Note 2).\nKEY ASSUMPTIONS\nThe recoverable amounts of CGUs have been determined based on fair value less costs of disposal calculations, using cash flow\nprojections from business plans prepared by management.\nThe Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for\neach of the Company’s CGUs. These budgets and forecast calculations are prepared for a period of five years. A long-term\ngrowth rate is applied to projected future cash flows after the fifth year.\nThe tables below show key assumptions used in fair value less costs of disposal calculations for CGUs with material goodwill or\nthose CGUs for which an impairment loss or an impairment reversal has been recorded.\nDiscount rates\nDiscount rates are initially determined in U.S. dollars based on the risk-free rate for 20-year maturity bonds of the United States\nTreasury, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the\nspecific CGU relative to the market as a whole.\nThe equity market risk premium is sourced from independent market analysts. The systematic risk, beta, represents the median\nof the raw betas of the entities comparable in size and geographic footprint with the ones of the Company (“Peer Group”). The\ncountry risk premium is based on an average default spread derived from sovereign credit ratings published by main credit rating\nagencies for a given CGU. The debt risk premium is based on the median of Standard & Poor’s long-term credit rating of the\nPeer Group. The weighted average cost of capital is determined based on target debt-to-equity ratios representing the median\nhistorical five year capital structure for each entity from the Peer Group.\nThe discount rate in functional currency of a CGU is adjusted for the long-term inflation forecast of the respective country in\nwhich the business operates, as well as the applicable country’s risk premium.\nDiscount rate\n(local currency)\n2023 2022\nPakistan 19.6 % 19.5 %\nBangladesh 13.9 % 14.6 %\nKazakhstan 12.9 % 13.8 %\nKyrgyzstan 17.0 % 19.0 %\nUzbekistan 14.7 % 15.8 %\nUkraine 20.8 % 21.7 %\nRevenue growth rates\nThe revenue growth rates during the forecast period vary based on numerous factors, including size of market, GDP (Gross\nDomestic Product), foreign currency projections, traffic growth, market share and others.

In doing this, management needs to assume a\nmarket participant perspective. Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular, the discount rate, capex\nintensity, operating margin and growth rate assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amounts of assets, could significantly\nimpact the Group’s impairment evaluation and hence results.\nA significant part of the Group’s operations is in countries with emerging markets. The political and economic situation in these\ncountries may change rapidly and recession may potentially have a significant impact on these countries. On-going recessionary\neffects in the world economy, including geopolitical situations and increased macroeconomic risks impact our assessment of cash\nflow forecasts and the discount rates applied.\nThere are significant variations between different markets with respect to growth, mobile penetration, ARPU, market share and\nsimilar parameters, resulting in differences in operating margins. The future development of operating margins is important in the\nGroup’s impairment assessments.\n178\n12 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following table summarizes the movement in the net book value of property and equipment for the years ended\nDecember 31:\nEquipment not\nTelecomm- Land, Office and installed and\nunications buildings and other assets under Right-of-\nNet book value equipment constructions equipment construction use assets Total\nAs of January 1, 2022 3,827 149 407 451 1,871 6,705\nAdditions 67 7 23 659 585 1,341\nDisposals (41) (1) (4) (10) (15) (71)\nDepreciation charge for the year (378) (6) (29) — (151) (564)\nDivestment and reclassification as held\nfor sale * (1,987) (80) (314) (235) (1,393) (4,009)\nImpairment (35) (2) — (2) (4) (43)\nImpairment reversal 56 1 3 6 4 70\nTransfers 522 5 14 (542) (5) (6)\nModifications of right-of-use assets — — — — 26 26\nTranslation adjustment (355) (13) (15) (42) (132) (557)\nAs of December 31, 2022 1,676 60 85 285 786 2,892\nAdditions 78 2 31 424 359 894\nDisposals (1) — — 4 (28) (25)\nDepreciation charge for the year (346) (5) (25) (1) (171) (548)\nDivestment and reclassification as held\nfor sale * (13) — (1) — — (14)\nImpairment (3) — — (2) — (5)\nImpairment reversal 2 — — 10 1 13\nTransfers 445 7 12 (479) — (15)\nModifications of right-of-use assets — — — — 29 29\nTranslation adjustment (180) (4) (5) (19) (64) (272)\nAs of December 31, 2023 1,658 60 97 222 912 2,949\nCost 4,391 136 375 238 1,361 6,501\nAccumulated depreciation and\nimpairment (2,733) (76) (278) (16) (449) (3,552)\n* This relates to the classification of Russia as held-for-sale and discontinued operations as explained in Note 10.\nThere were no material changes in estimates related to property and equipment in 2023.

If we are found to\nbe involved in practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be exposed to significant fines, the risk of\nprosecution or the suspension or loss of our licenses, frequency allocations, authorizations or various permissions, any of which\ncould harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAfter expiration of the license, our operating companies might be subject to additional payments for renewals, as well as new\nlicense capital and other commitments.\n180\nACCOUNTING POLICIES\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful life of VEON's assets\ngenerally fall within the following ranges:\nClass of property and equipment Useful life\nTelecommunication equipment 3 – 30 years\nBuildings and constructions 10 – 50 years\nOffice and other equipment 2 – 10 years\nRight-of-use assets Equivalent lease term\nEach asset’s residual value, useful life and method of depreciation is reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted\nprospectively, if necessary.\nWhere applicable, the Company has applied sale and leaseback accounting principles, whereas the right-of-use asset arising\nfrom the leaseback is measured at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use\nretained by VEON. Accordingly, VEON recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the\nbuyer-lessor.\nSOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\nDepreciation and amortization of non-current assets\nDepreciation and amortization expenses are based on management estimates of useful life, residual value and amortization\nmethod of property and equipment and intangible assets. Estimates may change due to technological developments,\ncompetition, changes in market conditions and other factors and may result in changes in the estimated useful life and in the\namortization or depreciation charges. Technological developments are difficult to predict and our views on the trends and pace of\ndevelopments may change over time. Some of the assets and technologies in which the Group invested several years ago are\nstill in use and provide the basis for new technologies.\nThe useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed at least annually, taking into consideration the\nfactors mentioned above and all other relevant factors. Estimated useful lives for similar types of assets may vary between\ndifferent entities in the Group due to local factors such as growth rate, maturity of the market, historical and expected\nreplacements or transfer of assets and quality of components used. Estimated useful life for right-of-use assets is directly\nimpacted by the equivalent lease term, refer to Note 16 for more information regarding Source of estimation uncertainty for lease\nterms.\n181\n13 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table summarizes the movement in the net book value of intangible assets for the years ended December 31:\nTelecommuni-\ncation licenses, Other\nfrequencies & Brands and Customer intangible\nNet book value permissions Software trademarks relationships assets Goodwill Total\nAs of January 1, 2022 1,202 342 14 98 22 1,542 3,220\nAdditions 525 73 1 2 19 10 630\nDisposals (5) (3) — — — — (8)\nAmortization charge for the year (139) (68) (3) (8) — — (218)\nReclassification as held for sale (84) (150) (2) (21) (21) (1,084) (1,362)\nTransfer — 3 — — (3) — —\nTranslation adjustment (241) (37) (3) (17) (14) (74) (386)\nImpairment reversal 75 2 — — — — 77\nAs of December 31, 2022 1,333 162 7 54 3 394 1,953\nAdditions 4 89 — — 5 — 98\nAmortization charge for the year (131) (64) (3) (6) (1) — (205)\nTransfer (1) 7 — — (1) — 5\nTranslation adjustment (180) (8) — (6) — (45) (239)\nAs of December 31, 2023 1,025 186 4 42 6 349 1,612\nCost 1,915 526 165 278 7 1,298 4,189\nAccumulated amortization and\nimpairment (890) (340) (161) (236) (1) (949) (2,577)\nDuring 2023, there were no material changes in estimates related to intangible assets.

The amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at\nleast annually and fall within the following ranges:\nClass of intangible asset Useful life\nTelecommunications licenses, frequencies and permissions 3 - 20 years\nSoftware 3 - 10 years\nBrands and trademarks 3 - 15 years\nCustomer relationships 10 - 21 years\nOther intangible assets 4 - 10 years\nGoodwill is recognized for the future economic benefits arising from net assets acquired that are not individually identified and\nseparately recognized. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually and as necessary when circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value may be impaired. See Note 11 for further details.\nSOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\nRefer also to Note 12 for further details regarding source of estimation uncertainty.\nDepreciation and amortization of non-current assets\nEstimates in the evaluation of useful lives for intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the estimated average customer\nrelationship based on churn, the remaining license or concession period and the expected developments in technology and\nmarkets.\nThe actual economic lives of intangible assets may be different than estimated useful lives, thereby resulting in a different\ncarrying value of intangible assets with finite lives. We continue to evaluate the amortization period for intangible assets with\nfinite lives to determine whether events or circumstances warrant revised amortization periods. A change in estimated useful\nlives is a change in accounting estimate, and depreciation and amortization charges are adjusted prospectively.\n183\n14 INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company held investments in material subsidiaries as of December 31 as detailed in the table below.

On January 31, 2023, VEON confirmed that the\nOrder had been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The amendments to the 2023 Notes were subject to the receipt of\nrelevant licenses to become effective, at which time the maturity dates of the February 2023 and April 2023 notes would be\namended to October and December 2023, respectively.\nOn April 3, 2023, VEON announced that each of the conditions had been satisfied in accordance with the terms of the Scheme,\nincluding receipt of all authorizations and/or licenses necessary to implement the amendments to the 2023 Notes (as set out in\nthe Scheme). On April 4, 2023, the Scheme became effective.\nPursuant to the amendments, Noteholders were entitled to payment of an amendment fee of 200bps payable on the 2023 Notes\noutstanding on their respective amended maturity dates and a put right was granted requiring VEON Holdings to repurchase\n2023 Notes held by 2023 Noteholders exercising such right, at a purchase price of 102% of the principal amount (“2023 Put\nOption”), together with accrued and unpaid interest. The 2023 Put Option closed on April 19, 2023 with holders of US$165 of the\nOctober 2023 Notes and holders of US$294 of the December 2023 Notes exercising the 2023 Put Option.

Upon such purchase by VimpelCom, these Notes were\nreclassified to intercompany debt with an equivalent reduction in gross debt for VEON Group. Out of these Notes, US$1,576\nequivalent Notes were offset against the purchase price and any notes outstanding at closing were transferred to a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of VEON Holdings B.V. and US$406 equivalent Notes were settled at maturity, while US$72 equivalent of VEON\nHolding B.V. Notes were held by VimpelCom as deferred consideration pending the receipt of an amended OFAC license. Upon\nreceipt of the license, these remaining US$72 equivalent Notes were transferred to the wholly owned subsidiary of VEON\nHoldings B.V. to offset the remaining deferred purchase price for VimpelCom. This was completed early July 2024. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, US$1,005 of the notes transferred to Unitel LLC (wholly owned subsidiary) remained outstanding.\nVEON US$1,250 multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement\nOn April 20, 2023, and May 30, 2023, the outstanding amounts under our RCF facility were rolled over until October 2023 for\nUS$692 and November 2023 for US$363.

VEON recorded the interest\nexpense related to these loans prior to the novation in VEON Finance Ireland DAC which is included within continuing\noperations. Given that the novation of these loans predated and was independent of the sale of our Russian discontinued\noperations, VEON deemed it appropriate not to reclassify the interest on these loans prior to the novation date to discontinued\noperations.\nBanglalink secures syndicated credit facility\nIn April 2022, Banglalink signed a BDT 12 billion (US$139) syndicated loan with a five year maturity till April 2027.

Observable inputs (Level 2) used in\nvaluation techniques include interbank interest rates, bond yields, swap curves, basis swap spreads, foreign exchange rates and\ncredit default spreads.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company reviews if there are any indicators for a possible transfer between fair value hierarchy levels.\nThis depends on how the Company is able to obtain the underlying input parameters when assessing the fair valuations. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements with the exception in 2022 of our RUB denominated bonds for which quoted market prices were not available due\nto the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.\nImpact of hedge accounting on equity\nThe below table sets out the reconciliation of each component of equity and the analysis of other comprehensive income (all of\nwhich are attributable to the equity owners of the parent):\nForeign currency\ntranslation reserve\nAs of January 1, 2022 (6,731)\nForeign currency revaluation of the foreign operations 121\nAs of December 31, 2022 (6,610)\nTransfer from OCI to income statement on disposal of subsidiary 3,384\nReclassification of net investment hedge 30\nOther comprehensive loss (593)\nAs of December 31, 2023 (3,789)\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\nPut options over non-controlling interest\nPut options over non-controlling interest of a subsidiary are accounted for as financial liabilities in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements. The put-option redemption liability is measured at the discounted redemption amount. Interest over the put-\noption redemption liability will accrue in line with the effective interest rate method, until the options have been exercised or are\nexpired.\nDerivative contracts\nVEON enters into derivative contracts, including swaps and forward contracts, to manage certain foreign currency and interest\nrate exposures when necessary and available. Any derivative instruments for which no hedge accounting is applied are recorded\nat fair value with any fair value changes recognized directly in profit or loss. Although some of the derivatives entered into by the\nCompany have not been designated in hedge accounting relationships, they act as economic hedges and offset the underlying\ntransactions when they occur. There have been no derivatives in hedge accounting relationships during 2023.\nHedges of a net investment\nThe Company applies net investment hedge accounting to mitigate foreign currency translation risk related to the Company’s\ninvestments in foreign operations. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective\nhedge is recognized in other comprehensive income within the “Foreign currency translation” line item. Where the hedging\ninstrument’s foreign currency retranslation is greater (in absolute terms) than that of the hedged item, the excess amount is\nrecorded in profit or loss as ineffectiveness. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the\nhedge that has been recognized in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a\nreclassification adjustment on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation. Cash flows arising from derivative\ninstruments for which hedge accounting is applied are reported in the statement of cash flows within the line item where the\nunderlying cash flows of the hedged item are recorded.\n194\nFair value of financial instruments\nAll financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortized cost, except those which are measured at fair value as presented\nwithin this Note 16.\nWhere the fair value of financial assets and liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active\nmarkets, their fair value is determined using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows models. The inputs to these\nmodels are taken from observable markets, but when this is not possible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair\nvalues. The judgements include considerations regarding inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in\nassumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.\nMeasurement of lease liabilities\nLease liabilities are measured upon initial recognition at the present value of the future lease and related fixed services payments\nover the lease term, discounted with the country specific incremental borrowing rate as the rate implicit in the lease is generally\nnot available. Subsequently lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.\nA significant portion of the lease contracts included within Company’s lease portfolio includes lease contracts which are\nextendable through mutual agreement between VEON and the lessor, or lease contracts which are cancellable by the Company\nimmediately or on short notice. The Company includes these cancellable future lease periods within the assessed lease term,\nwhich increases the future lease payments used in determining the lease liability upon initial recognition, except when it is not\nreasonably certain at the commencement of the lease that these will be exercised.\nThe Company continuously assesses whether a revision of lease terms is required due to a change in management judgement\nregarding, for example, the exercise of extension and/or termination options. When determining whether an extension option is\nnot reasonably certain to be exercised, VEON considers all relevant facts and circumstances that creates an economic incentive\nto exercise the extension option, or not to exercise a termination option, such as strategic plans, future technology changes, and\nvarious economic costs and penalties.\n195\n17 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other\npurposes. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash at bank and on hand and highly liquid investments that are readily\nconvertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to only an insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity\nof less than three months.\nCash and cash equivalents consisted of the following items as of December 31:\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents at banks and on hand 423 898\nCash equivalents with original maturity of less than three months 1,453 2,179\nCash and cash equivalents, as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows* 1,876 3,077\n* Cash and cash equivalents include an amount of US$165 relating to banking operations in Pakistan, which does not include customer deposits that are part of\n‘Trade and other payables’ of US$426.\nCash at banks earns interest based on bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day\nand three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Company, and earn interest at the respective short-\nterm deposit rates.\nThe imposition of currency exchange controls or other similar restrictions on currency convertibility in the countries in which\nVEON operates could limit VEON’s ability to convert local currencies or repatriate local cash in a timely manner or at all, as well\nas remit dividends from the respective countries. As of December 31, 2023, US$151 (2022: US$122) of cash at the level of\nUkraine was subject to currency restrictions that limited ability to upstream the cash or make certain payments outside the\ncountry, but these balances are otherwise freely available to the Ukrainian operations.\nCash balances include investments in money market funds of US$1,175 (2022: US$1,950), which are carried at fair value\nthrough profit or loss with gains presented within ‘Other non-operating gain / (loss)’ within the consolidated income statement.\nThe overdrawn accounts are presented as debt and derivatives within the statement of financial position. At the same time,\nbecause the overdrawn accounts are part of the Company’s cash management, they were included as cash and cash\nequivalents within the statement of cash flows. Refer to Note 23 for further discussion on the Company’s liquidity position.\n196\n18 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Group’s principal financial liabilities consist of loans and borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of\nthese financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has trade and other receivables, cash and short-term\ndeposits that are derived directly from its operations.\nThe Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s Board of Directors manages these risks with\nsupport of the treasury function, who proposes the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group, identifies and\nmeasures financial risks and suggests mitigating actions. The Company’s Board of Directors, approves the financial risk\nmanagement framework and oversees its enforcement.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily due to its long-term debt obligations. The\nCompany manages its interest rate risk exposure through a portfolio of fixed and variable rate borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 54% of the Company’s borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (2022: 69%).\nThe Group is exposed to possible changes in interest rates on variable interest loans and borrowings, partially mitigated through\ncash and cash equivalents and current deposits. With all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit before tax is\naffected through changes in the floating rate of borrowings while the Company’s equity is affected through the impact of a parallel\nshift of the yield curve on the fair value of hedging derivatives. An increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates would\nhave an immaterial impact on the Company’s income statement and other comprehensive income.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nThe Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the debt denominated in currencies\nother than the functional currency of the relevant entity, the Company’s operating activities (predominantly capital expenditures at\nsubsidiary level denominated in a different currency from the subsidiary’s functional currency) and the Company’s net\ninvestments in foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company manages its foreign currency risk by selectively hedging committed exposures.\nThe Company hedges part of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into U.S. dollars of its foreign operations by holding\nthe borrowings in foreign currencies or by foreign exchange swaps and forwards. During the periods covered by these financial\nstatements, the Company used foreign exchange forwards to mitigate foreign currency risk.\nForeign currency sensitivity\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar with all other\nvariables held constant. Additional sensitivity changes to the indicated currencies are expected to be approximately\nproportionate. The table shows the effect on the Company’s profit before tax (due to changes in the value of monetary assets\nand liabilities, including foreign currency derivatives). The Company’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other\ncurrencies is not material.\nEffect on profit / (loss) before\ntax\n10% 10%\nChange in foreign exchange rate against US$ depreciation appreciation\n2023\nRussian Ruble 14 (16)\nBangladeshi Taka (30) 33\nPakistani Rupee (13) 15\nUkrainian Hryvnia (2) 2\nOther currencies (net) (2) 2\n2022\nRussian Ruble (5) 6\nBangladeshi Taka (34) 37\nPakistani Rupee (15) 17\nUkrainian Hryvnia (1) 1\nOther currencies (net) — (1)\n197\nCREDIT RISK\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily from trade receivables), and from its treasury\nactivities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments.\nSee Note 17 for further information on restrictions on cash balances.\nTrade receivables consist of amounts due from customers for airtime usage and amounts due from dealers and customers for\nequipment sales. VEON’s credit risk arising from the services the Company provides to customers is mitigated to a large extent\ndue to the majority of its active customers being subscribed to a prepaid service as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\naccordingly not giving rise to credit risk. For postpaid services, in certain circumstances, VEON requires deposits as collateral for\nairtime usage. Equipment sales are typically paid in advance of delivery, except for equipment sold to dealers on credit terms.\nVEON’s credit risk arising from its trade receivables from dealers is mitigated due to the risk being spread across a large number\nof dealers. Management periodically reviews the history of payments and credit worthiness of the dealers. The Company also\nhas receivables from other local and international operators from interconnect and roaming services provided to their customers,\nas well as receivables from customers using fixed-line services, such as business services, wholesale services and services to\nresidents. Receivables from other operators for roaming services are settled through clearing houses, which helps to mitigate\ncredit risk in this regard.\nVEON holds available cash in bank accounts, as well as other financial assets with financial institutions in countries where it\noperates. To manage credit risk associated with such asset holdings, VEON allocates its available cash to a variety of local\nbanks and local affiliates of international banks within the limits set forth by its treasury policy. Management periodically reviews\nthe creditworthiness of the banks with which it holds assets. In respect of financial instruments used by the Company’s treasury\nfunction, the aggregate credit risk the Group may have with one counterparty is managed by reference to, amongst others, the\nlong-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moody’s, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s and CDS spreads of that\ncounterparty. The limits are set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential\ncounterparty’s failure. Refer to Note 23 for further details on the Company’s liquidity position.\nValue Added Tax (“VAT”) is recoverable from tax authorities by offsetting it against VAT payable to the tax authorities on VEON’s\nrevenue or direct cash receipts from the tax authorities. Management periodically reviews the recoverability of the balance of\ninput value added tax and believes it is fully recoverable.\nVEON issues advances to a variety of its vendors of property and equipment for its network development. The contractual\narrangements with the most significant vendors provide for equipment financing in respect of certain deliveries of equipment.\nVEON periodically reviews the financial position of vendors and their compliance with the contract terms.\nVEON’s credit risk arising from its receivables from related parties is in some instances partly offset by having payables to the\nsame related parties. Management periodically reviews the related party positions and sees no material credit risk.\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the statement of financial position at December 31, 2023\nand 2022 is the carrying amount as illustrated in Note 5, Note 16, Note 17 and within this Note 18.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nThe Company monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. The Company’s objective is to\nmaintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bonds, bank overdrafts, bank loans and lease\ncontracts. The Company’s policy is to create a balanced debt maturity profile. As of December 31, 2023, 32% of the Company’s\ndebt (2022: 39%) will mature in less than one year based on the carrying value of bank loans, bonds and other borrowings\nreflected in the financial statements. The Company has sufficient HQ liquidity to meets its HQ maturities and local market access to\naddress local maturities and on that basis. The Company has taken this into considerations when it assessed the concentration of risk with\nrespect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low except for the additional risks identified in Note 23\nAvailable facilities\nThe Company had the following available facilities as of December 31:\nAmounts in millions of transactional currency US$ equivalent amounts\nFinal\nFacility Facility\navailability Utilized Available Utilized Available\namount amount\nperiod\n2023\nKaR-Tel LLP - Term Facility Nov 2026 KZT15,000 KZT9,800 KZT5,200 33 22 11\nBanglalink Digital\nCommunications Ltd - Term May 2024\nBDT 8,000 BDT 5,000 BDT 3,000 73 46 27\nFacility\n198\nAmounts in millions of transactional currency US$ equivalent amounts\nFinal\nFacility Facility\navailability Utilized Available Utilized Available\namount amount\nperiod\n2022\nPMCL - Term Facility Apr 2023 PKR 40,000 PKR 30,000 PKR 10,000 176 132 44\n199\nMaturity profile\nThe table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.\nPayments related to variable interest rate financial liabilities and derivatives are included based on the interest rates and foreign\ncurrency exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total amounts in the table differ from\nthe carrying amounts as stated in Note 16 as the below table includes both undiscounted principal amounts and interest while\nthe carrying amounts are measured using the effective interest rate method.\nLess than More than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\nAs of December 31, 2023\nBank loans and bonds 1,433 1,392 1,415 237 4,477\nLease liabilities 289 471 356 508 1,624\nDerivative financial liabilities\nGross cash inflows (14) — — — (14)\nGross cash outflows 16 — — — 16\nTrade and other payables 1,270 — — — 1,270\nOther financial liabilities 137 202 86 66 491\nTotal financial liabilities 3,131 2,065 1,857 811 7,864\nLess than More than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\nAs of December 31, 2022\nBank loans and bonds 2,796 2,671 2,013 351 7,831\nLoans from related parties 312 — — — 312\nLease liabilities 235 396 306 390 1,327\nTrade and other payables 1,126 — — — 1,126\nOther financial liabilities 176 322 142 52 692\nTotal financial liabilities 4,645 3,389 2,461 793 11,288\n200\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nThe primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios, so as to help\nfacilitate access to debt and capital markets and maximize shareholder value. The Company manages its capital structure and\nmakes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic or political conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the\nCompany may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. In September\n2019, VEON Ltd. announced a dividend policy that targets paying at least 50% of prior year Equity Free Cash Flow after licenses\nso long as VEON Ltd.’s Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio would remain below 2.4x. See the paragraph below for more\ninformation on how VEON Ltd.’s Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated. Dividend payments remain subject to the\nreview by VEON Ltd.’s Board of Directors of medium-term investment opportunities and VEON Ltd.’s capital structure. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, VEON Ltd. did not pay a dividend. There were no changes made in VEON\nLtd.’s objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during 2023, however as a result of the unstable environment we put\nmore emphasis on safeguarding liquidity and also counterparty risk management in light of the high cash balances. Despite the\nresilient performance of its underlying operating companies, the Company’s ability to upstream cash for debt service has been\nimpaired by currency and capital controls in its major markets, and due to other geopolitical and foreign exchange pressures\neffecting emerging markets more generally. Furthermore, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the developments\nsince February 2022 with respect to sanctions laws and regulations have resulted in unprecedented challenges for the Company,\nlimiting access to the international debt capital markets in which the Company has traditionally refinanced maturing debt, which\nhas hampered its ability to refinance its indebtedness. The Company has sold its Russian Operations and implemented the\nScheme to manage certain of its indebtedness and to help address the unprecedented challenges the Group faced.in relation to\nits capital management.\nThe Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is an important measure used by the Company to assess its capital structure. Net Debt\nrepresents the principal amount of interest-bearing debt less cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits. Adjusted EBITDA is\ndefined as last twelve months earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment, loss on disposals of non-\ncurrent assets, other non-operating losses and share of profit / (loss) of joint ventures. For reconciliation of ‘Profit / (loss) before\ntax from continuing operations’ to ‘Adjusted EBITDA,’ refer to Note 2.\nFurther, this ratio is included as a financial covenant in certain credit facilities of the Company. Under these credit facilities, the\nCompany is required to maintain the Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio at or below the level agreed in such facility. The\nCompany has not breached any financial or non-financial covenants during the period covered by these financial statements.\n201\n19 ISSUED CAPITAL AND RESERVES\nThe following table details the common shares of the Company as of December 31:\n2023 2022\nAuthorized common shares (nominal value of EUR 1 per share) 70,000,000 70,000,000\nIssued and outstanding shares 30,099,998 30,099,998\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 70,000,000 authorized common shares (2022: 70,000,000) with a nominal value of\nEUR 1 per share, of which 30,099,998 shares were issued, outstanding and are fully paid-up (2022: 30,099,998).\nNature and purpose of reserves\nOther capital reserves are mainly used to recognize the results of transactions that do not result in a change of control with non-\ncontrolling interest (see Note 14). The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from\nthe translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, net of any related hedging activities (see Note 16).\n202\n20 DIVIDENDS PAID AND PROPOSED\nThere were no dividends declared by the Company in respect of the year 2023.\nDIVIDENDS DECLARED TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS\nDuring 2023 and 2022, certain subsidiaries of the Company declared dividends, of which a portion was paid or payable to non-\ncontrolling interests as shown in the table below:\nName of subsidiary 2023 2022\nVIP Kazakhstan Holding AG 30 —\nTNS Plus LLP 15 11\nOther — 3\nTotal dividends declared to non-controlling interests 45 14\n203\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n21 RELATED PARTIES\nThe immediate parent and ultimate controlling shareholder of the Company are, respectively, VEON Amsterdam B.V. and VEON\nLtd.\nThe following table provides the total amount of transactions that have been entered into with related parties and their affiliates\nfor the years ended December 31:\n2023 2022\nFinance income 86 48\nNet gain on transfer of towers to Ukraine Tower Company — 4\n86 52\nFinance cost (8) (34)\n(8) (34)\nThe following table provides the total balance of accounts with related parties and their affiliates at the end of the relevant period:\n2023 2022\nAccounts receivable due from\nVEON Ltd. 78 84\nVEON Amsterdam B.V. 22 18\nVEON Digital Amsterdam B.V. 13 —\nOthers 11 9\nFinancial asset receivable from\nVEON Ltd. 160 60\nVEON Amsterdam B.V. 1,462 1,401\nVEON Digital Amsterdam B.V. — 300\nUkraine Tower Company — 13\nVEON Digital limited — 26\nInterest accrued 149 76\n1,895 1,987\nAccounts payable to related parties\nVEON Ltd. 55 41\nVEON Wholesale Services BV 25 4\nOthers 31 35\nFinancial liabilities to related parties\nVEON Digital Amsterdam B.V. — 300\nUkraine Tower Company 155 125\nInterest accrued — 5\n266 510\nCOMPENSATION TO DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGERS OF THE COMPANY\nVEON Holdings B.V, and its consolidated subsidiaries are part of the VEON Group and their operations are managed by the\nMembers of the Board of Directors of VEON Ltd. (i.e. the ultimate parent company). Consequently, the Company considers the\nBoard of Directors of VEON Ltd. together with the directors of the Company, Group Chief Executive Officer, Group Chief\nFinancial Officer and Group General Counsel to be the key management personnel, as defined by IAS 24, Related Party\nDisclosures and finds it appropriate to disclose the compensation of the key management of the VEON Group.

The group of individuals we consider to be senior managers has changed in recent years,\nincluding in 2022, a determination that the chief executive officers of our operating companies should no longer be classified as senior managers and in 2023 the\nreduction in the Group Executive Committee. As a result, for 2023 reporting, we have changed the total compensation perimeter for the Board of Directors and senior\n204\nmanagers to reflect this internal view. Total compensation paid to the Board of Directors and senior management approximates the amount charged in the\nconsolidated income statement for that year with the exception of the share-based payment in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nUnder VEON Ltd.’s bye-laws, the Board of Directors of VEON Ltd. established a Remuneration and Governance Committee,\nwhich has the overall responsibility for approving and evaluating the compensation and benefit plans, policies and programs of\nthe VEON’s directors, officers and employees and for supervising the administration of the VEON ’s equity incentive plans and\nother compensation and incentive programs.\nCompensation of VEON Ltd.

The grant date fair value is expensed over the vesting period, taking into account expected forfeitures\nand non-market performance conditions, if any, with a corresponding increase in equity. This is based upon the Company’s\nestimate of the shares or share options that will eventually vest which takes account of all service and non-market performance\nconditions, if applicable, with adjustments being made where new information indicate the number of shares or share options\nexpected to vest differs from previous estimates.\nCash-settled share-based payments are measured at the grant date fair value and recorded as a liability. The Company\nremeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period until the date of settlement, with any changes in fair\nvalue recognized as selling, general and administrative expenses within the income statement. The approach used to account for\nvesting conditions when measuring equity-settled transactions also applies to cash-settled transaction.\nOther short-term benefits not related to share-based payments are expensed in the period when services are received.\n208\n22 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD\nVEON and Summit complete US$100 deal for Bangladesh towers portfolio\nOn January 31, 2024, VEON announced that, further to the announcement dated November 15, 2023, and the legal transfer of\ntowers in December 2023 following the receipt of all regulatory approvals, its wholly owned subsidiary, Banglalink has obtained\nthe cash consideration for the sale of approximately BDT 11 billion (approximately US$96).\nRepayment of the RCF\nIn February 2024, we repaid US$250 of drawn commitments maturing in March 2024 under our US$1,055 RCF, and in March\n2024, we repaid the remaining amounts outstanding of US$805 under our RCF, originally due in March 2025, and canceled the\nRCF.\nIssuance of PKR bond by PMCL\nIn April 2024, PMCL issued a short term PKR bond of PKR 15 billion (US$52) with a maturity of six months.

The Company’s last\n211\nday of trading on Euronext Amsterdam will be November 22, 2024 (the “Last Trading Date”) and the delisting will be effective\nfrom November 25, 2024.\nAgreement with Impact Investments LLC for Strategic Support and Board Advisory Services\nOn June 7, 2024, VEON Ltd. entered into a letter agreement as amended on August 1, 2024 (the “2024 Agreement”) with Impact\nInvestments which will provide strategic support and board advisory services to VEON Ltd. and JSC Kyivstar (a wholly owned\nindirect subsidiary of VEON Ltd.). Michael Pompeo, who was appointed to the Board of Directors of VEON Ltd. on May 31, 2024,\nserves as Executive Chairman of Impact Investments. In exchange for the services provided, VEON Ltd. will pay Impact\nInvestments US$0.05 in cash per month on or about the 7th day of each month during the term of the 2024 Agreement. Further,\nVEON Ltd. has granted to Impact Investments three VEON Ltd. common share warrants (hereby “Warrant A”, “Warrant B”, and\n“Warrant C”), with a value of $12, $2, and $2 worth of common shares in the capital of VEON Ltd., respectively.

Finally,\nVEON Ltd., in its sole discretion, may pay Impact Investments an additional fee up to $3 subject to completion of certain strategic\nobjectives.\nOn June 7, 2024, VEON Ltd. and Impact Investments also entered into a termination letter in connection with a letter agreement\nbetween VEON Ltd. and Impact Investments dated November 16, 2023. Under the terms of the termination letter, VEON Ltd.\npaid Impact Investments $2 in common VEON Ltd. shares or 2,066,954 shares (equal to 82,678 ADS), which common VEON\nLtd. shares were determined on the basis of the 90-day average trading price of the VEON Ltd. common shares as of the date of\nthe termination letter. These common shares were transferred to Impact Investments in August 2024, for strategic support and\nboard advisory services to JSC Kyivstar performed by Impact Investments under the letter agreement between VEON Ltd., JSC\nKyivstar and Impact Investments dated November 16, 2023.\nVEON Ltd. Announces Plan to Move its Headquarters to Dubai\nOn October 14, 2024, VEON Ltd. announced its plan to move the Group Headquarters from Amsterdam to the DIFC in the\nUnited Arab Emirates. VEON Ltd. also plans to update its corporate entity structure to reflect the relocation of the headquarters\nfrom move from the Netherlands to the DIFC, subject to tax and structuring analyses. On November 15, 2024, VEON Ltd.\nfurther announced that it has completed the registration of and received the commercial license for its branch office in Dubai\nInternational Finance Centre (“DIFC”).\nKaR-Tel Limited Liability Partnership credit facilities\nOn September 25, 2024 KaR-Tel Limited Liability Partnership (\"KaR-Tel\") signed a new bilateral credit facility with JSC Nurbank\nof KZT 18 billion (US$37) with a maturity of five years carrying fixed interest rate of 15.5%. On October 8, 2024, KaR-Tel utilized\nKZT 4.5 billion (US$10) from this facility. Subsequently, during October and November 2024, Kar-Tel further utilized KZT 6 billion\n(US$12).\n2024 Annual Impairment Analysis\nDuring July and August 2024 there was increased political uncertainty in Bangladesh culminating in network outages and\nblockages experienced by our Bangladesh subsidiary in connection with mass protests, civil unrest and riots that resulted in the\nfall of the government of Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina and the establishment of an interim government. These events and the\npolitical unrest have negatively impacted the populations’ disposable income and influenced telecom spending patterns, while\nincreased operation costs for the business unit identified indicators of an impairment event with respect to our Bangladesh CGU\nin the third quarter of 2024. Management has not yet finalized the quantitative and qualitative assessments and valuation tests\nrequired to determine the estimated financial impact of such triggers in Bangladesh during the third quarter of 2024. Preliminary\nanalysis suggests that we may incur a substantial impairment charge to the carrying value of the Bangladesh CGU for the period\nended September 30, 2024. As of the date of November 20, 2024, we do not have enough certainty to provide an estimate of the\ncharge or range of potential outcomes, but initial results of quantitative and qualitative assessments and valuation tests indicate\nthat an impairment charge is likely to be material. We, however, cannot rule out the possibility that the final results of our\nimpairment analysis may deviate significantly from our preliminary assessment. Final results of the analysis will be published in\nour interim unaudited consolidated condensed financial statement for the period ended September 30, 2024. Following the\nannual impairment goodwill test as at September 30, 2023 and the subsequent triggering event analysis as at December 31,\n2023, no impairments were found at our Bangladesh CGU as, amongst other factors, it was operating in a revenue growth period\n(which period lasted through our second quarter of 2024), however, the Bangladesh CGU did have limited headroom in its\ncarrying value; as a result, the impairment charge is expected to have a direct impact on our operating profit. See Note 11 for\nfurther detail. The circumstances in Bangladesh could also impact our assessment relating to the recognition and recoverability\nof our deferred tax assets in Bangladesh.\nChanges in Directors of VEON Holdings B.V.\nOn March 7, 2024, Bruce John Leishman and Maciej Bogdan Wojtaszek were appointed statutory directors of the Company,\nwhile on the same date Jochem Benjamin Postma and Paul Klaassen stepped down as statutory directors of the Company.\n212\nIssuance of PKR Sukuk bond by Pakistan Mobile Communication Limited (\"PMCL\")\nIn October 2024, Pakistan Mobile Communication Limited (\"PMCL\") issued short term PKR sukuk bond of PKR 15 billion\n(US$54) with a maturity of six months. Coupon rate is 3 months Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (KIBOR) minus 10 bps per\nannum.\nUnitel LLC credit facility\nOn October 7, 2024 Unitel LLC signed a new credit facility agreement with JSC “National Bank for Foreign Economic Activity of\nthe Republic of Uzbekistan” for UZS 191.3 billion (US$14) with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 22% per annum.\nDuring November 2024, Unitel LLC utilized the full amount from this facility.\nVEON appoints UHY LLP as auditors for VEON Group's 2024 PCAOB Audit\nOn November 13, 2024, VEON announced that the VEON Board of Directors has re-appointed UHY LLP (“UHY”) as the\nindependent registered public accounting firm for the audit of the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 in accordance with the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, United\nStates (the \"PCAOB Audit\").\n213\n23 BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBASIS OF PREPARATION\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n(“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted by the European Union and the applicable\narticles of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, effective at the time of preparing the consolidated financial statements and\napplied by VEON.\nThe consolidated income statement has been presented based on the nature of the expense, other than ‘Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses’, which has been presented based on the function of the expense.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise disclosed.\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all\nentities (including structured entities) over which the Company has control. Please refer to Note 14 for a list of significant\nsubsidiaries.\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.\nWhen necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies.\nWhen the Group ceases to consolidate a subsidiary due to loss of control, the related subsidiary’s assets (including goodwill),\nliabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity are de-recognized. This may mean that amounts previously\nrecognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. Any consideration received is recognized at fair\nvalue, and any investment retained is re-measured to its fair value, and this fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the\npurposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest. Any resultant gain or loss is recognized in the income statement.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in U.S. dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own\nfunctional currency and amounts included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\nUpon consolidation, the assets and liabilities measured in the functional currency are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange\nrates prevailing on the balance sheet date; whereas income and expenses are generally translated into U.S. dollars at historical\nmonthly average exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating financial\nstatements into U.S. dollars are reported in other comprehensive income and accumulated within a separate component of\nequity.\nRESTATEMENT OF 2022 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAfter the issuance of VEON Holdings B.V.’s Dutch statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022\nauthorized by the Board of Directors on June 29, 2023, the Company discovered an error in the consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive income with respect to the de-recognition of non-controlling interest for the sale of its Algerian operations (refer to\nNote 10 for further details) which was corrected. Under Dutch law, the Company determined the error does not result in financial\nstatements that are seriously defective in providing a view that enables a sound judgement to be formed on assets, liabilities,\nequity and results of the Company and, insofar as the nature of financial statements permit, of its solvency and liquidity. In\naccordance with IFRS and Dutch law, the Company has corrected and disclosed the error retrospectively in its statutory\naccounts in its Q3 2023 financial statements and in the full year 2023 Dutch annual report.\nThe non-controlling interest was incorrectly de-recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component within equity,\nwhile it should have been de-recognized directly in equity without an impact in OCI. With respect to the consolidated statement of\nchanges in equity, the amount was previously presented in the Dutch statutory financial statements as a line item within OCI and\nis now presented as a separate line item on the statement with no impact to OCI in the 2022 Annual Report. Refer to the impact\non the consolidated statement of comprehensive income below. Thus, the error correction resulted in an adjustment in the\nconsolidated statement of changes in equity which has no impact on total consolidated equity as well as an adjustment in the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nFurther, the error had no impact on the result on the sale of Algeria (refer to Note 10) as presented on the consolidated income\nstatement and no impact on the consolidated income statement as a whole. Additionally, the error had no impact on the\nconsolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of cash flows, basic or diluted earnings per share, adjusted\nEBITDA, nor on VEON’s financial covenants for its lenders.\nStatement of Comprehensive Income\n214\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 Impact of correction of the error\nVEON Holdings\nB.V.

Currently, we have 24 million subscribers in Ukraine, where they are\nsupported by 4,000 employees. VEON’s priority is to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. We\nhave developed and, in some cases, implemented additional contingency plans to relocate work and/or personnel to other\ngeographies and add new locations, as appropriate. As of November 20, 2024, most of our Ukraine subsidiary’s employees\nremain in the country. As of November 20, 2024, millions of people have fled Ukraine and the country has sustained significant\ndamage to infrastructure and assets.\nAs the war persists, we could lose a greater percentage of our customer base in Ukraine. If Ukrainian refugees choose to\nrelocate permanently outside of Ukraine and switch to local providers, this could have a significant impact on their use and\nspending on our services. Due to the efforts of our Ukrainian team as well as collaboration with other telecommunications\noperators in the region, network capacity has remained stable with minimal disruptions since the beginning of the war. On\nDecember 12, 2023, VEON announced that the network of its Ukrainian subsidiary Kyivstar had been the target of a widespread\nexternal cyber-attack, causing a technical failure. This resulted in a temporary disruption of Kyivstar's network and services,\ninterrupting the provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and fixed networks, international roaming, and SMS services,\namongst others, for Kyivstar customers in Ukraine and abroad. The Company’s technical teams, working relentlessly and in\ncollaboration with the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, the Security Service of Ukraine and government agencies, restored\nservices in multiple stages starting with voice and data connectivity. On December 19, 2023, VEON announced that Kyivstar had\nrestored services in all categories of its communication services, with mobile voice and internet, fixed connectivity, SMS and\nMyKyivstar self-care application active and available across Ukraine. Refer to Note 1 for further details. We have incurred and\nwill continue to incur additional expenditures to maintain and repair our mobile and fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure in\nUkraine as a result of any damage inflicted on our infrastructure due to the ongoing war, as well as for security, increased energy\ncosts, and related operational and capital expenditures. In addition, our ability to provide services in Ukraine may be impaired if\nwe are unable to maintain key personnel within Ukraine and/or our infrastructure within Ukraine is significantly damaged or\ndestroyed.\nIn response to the events in Ukraine, the United States, European Union (and individual EU member states) and, the United\nKingdom, as well as other countries have imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions and trade restrictions which have targeted\n215\nindividuals and entities as well as large aspects of the Russian economy, including freezing the assets of Russia’s central bank,\nother Russian financial institutions, and individuals, removing selected Russian banks from the Swift banking system, and\ncurbing certain products exported to Russia.\nEffective October 9, 2023, VimpelCom was deconsolidated from the VEON Group and, as such, the VEON Group no longer has\noperations in Russia. The risks related to sanctions, trade restrictions, and export bans targeting the Russian Federation and\nVimpelCom itself as well as risks related to counter-sanctions imposed by Russia, including the potential risk of imposing\nadministration over Russian assets, have been sufficiently mitigated. As a result of the VimpelCom disposal, cybersecurity risk\nhas been significantly reduced.\nUkraine has also implemented and may implement further sanctions or measures on individuals or entities with close ties to\nRussia, which may negatively impact Kyivstar if VEON is considered by local Ukrainian authorities as being a company\ncontrolled by sanctioned persons. For example, in October 2022, Ukraine imposed sanctions for a ten-year period against\nMikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and Andriy Kosogov, who are some of the beneficial owners of LetterOne, which, in turn, is one of\nVEON's shareholders. These Ukrainian sanctions apply exclusively to the sanctioned individuals and do not have a direct impact\non the Company, however, the Company cannot rule out their impact on banks' and other parties readiness to engage in\ntransactions involving the Company. Furthermore, these sanctions may make it difficult for the Company to obtain local financing\nin Ukrainian hryvnia, which could make it more difficult for us to naturally hedge any debt required for our Ukrainian operations\nmoving forward to the currency in which we generate revenue. On October 6, 2023, the Security Services of Ukraine (SSU)\nannounced that the Ukrainian courts froze all “corporate rights” of Mikhail Fridman in 20 Ukrainian companies in which he holds a\nbeneficial interest, while criminal proceedings against Mikhail Fridman and which are unrelated to VEON or any of our\nsubsidiaries are in progress. This announcement was incorrectly characterized by some Ukrainian media as a “seizure” or\n“freezing” of “Kyivstar’s assets”. On October 9, 2023, Ukrainian media further reported, with a headline which incorrectly\nidentified Kyivstar, that the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine was separately finalizing a lawsuit in the Ukraine High Anti-Corruption\nCourt to confiscate any Ukrainian assets of Mikhail Fridman. We have received notification from our local custodian that the\nfollowing percentages of the corporate rights in our Ukrainian subsidiaries have been frozen: (i) 47.85% of Kyivstar, (ii) 100% of\nUkraine Tower Company, (iii) 100% of Kyivstar.Tech, and (iv) 69.99% of Helsi Ukraine. The freezing of these corporate rights\nprevents any transactions involving our shares in such subsidiaries from proceeding. On October 30, 2023 VEON announced\nthat two appeals were filed with the relevant Kyiv courts, challenging the freezing of the corporate rights in Kyivstar and Ukraine\nTower Company, noting that corporate rights in Kyivstar and Ukraine Tower Company belong exclusively to VEON, and that their\nfull or partial freezing or seizure directly violates the rights of VEON and its international debt and equity investors, and\nrequesting the lifting of the freezing of its corporate rights in Kyivstar and Ukraine Tower Company. In December 2023, the court\nrejected the Company’s appeals. On June 4, 2024, the CEO of VEON, in his capacity as a shareholder of VEON, filed a motion\nwith Shevchenkivskiy District Court of Kyiv requesting cancellation of the freezing of corporate rights in Ukraine Tower Company.\nOn June 26, 2024, the motion was supplemented to request cancellation of the freezing of corporate rights in the VEON group's\nother Ukrainian subsidiaries: Kyivstar, Kyivstar.Tech and Helsi Ukraine. VEON is continuing significant government affairs efforts\nto protect our assets in Ukraine.\nRestrictions applicable in Ukraine to all foreign-owned companies have already led to restrictions on the upstreaming of\ndividends from Ukraine to VEON. Additionally, to the extent that VEON and/or Kyivstar are deemed to be controlled by persons\nsanctioned in Ukraine, potential prohibitions on (i) the transfer of technology and intellectual rights to Kyivstar from VEON,\nrenting of state property and land, and (ii) prohibitions on participation in public procurement impacting B2G revenue would\napply.\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine, and the sanctions imposed by the various jurisdictions, counter sanctions and other legal and\nregulatory measures, as well as responses by our service providers, partners, suppliers and other counterparties, including\ncertain professional service providers we rely on, and the consequences of all the foregoing, have negatively impacted and, if the\nwar, sanctions and such responses continue or escalate, will continue to negatively impact aspects of our operations and results\nin Ukraine, and may affect aspects of our operations and results in the other countries in which we operate.\nThe war has directly and indirectly resulted in the following events and conditions that may cast significant doubt on the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern:\n• The current events in the regions where we operate in Ukraine and where we derive a significant amount of our\nbusiness may pose security risks to our people, our facilities, our operations, and infrastructure, such as utilities and\nnetwork services, and the disruption of any or all of them could significantly affect our business, financial conditions and\nresults of operations in Ukraine, and cause volatility in the value of our securities. The war has also had a marked\nimpact on the economy of Ukraine. However, since the beginning of the war, a significant majority of Ukraine’s network\ninfrastructure has been operating effectively and disruptions in service have been limited to specific areas where the\nwar is most intense. As mentioned above, in December 2023, Kyivstar was the target of a widespread external cyber-\nattack, causing a technical failure. This resulted in a temporary disruption of Kyivstar's network and services,\ninterrupting the provision of voice and data connectivity on mobile and fixed networks, international roaming, and SMS\nservices, amongst others, for Kyivstar customers in Ukraine and abroad, which were subsequently restored. It cannot\nbe ruled out that the war and related damage could escalate within Ukraine.\n• We may need to record future impairment charges in Ukraine or CGUs, which could be material, if the war continues or\nescalates and/or due to macroeconomic conditions.\n216\n• As of October 31, 2024, the Company continues to conclude that neither VEON Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries is\ntargeted by sanctions imposed by any of the United States, European Union (and individual EU member states) and the\nUnited Kingdom. However, the interpretation and enforcement of these new sanctions and counter-sanctions may result\nin unanticipated outcomes and could give rise to material uncertainties, which could complicate our business decisions.\nFor example, to protect U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, the U.S. government has broad discretion to\nat times impose a broad range of extraterritorial “secondary” sanctions under which non-U.S. persons carrying out\ncertain activities may be penalized or designated as sanctioned parties, even if the activities have no ties, contact with,\nor nexus to the United States or the U.S. financial system at all. These secondary sanctions could be imposed on the\nCompany or any of the Company’s subsidiaries if they were to engage in activity that the U.S. government determined\nwas undertaken knowingly and rose to the level of material or significant support to, for, or on behalf of certain\nsanctioned parties.\n• Based on the current state of affairs, the Company currently has sufficient liquidity to satisfy our current obligations at\nleast over the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements without the need of additional financing\nassuming no early repayments of our long-term debt. In addition, cash on hand was US$963 as of September 30, 2024\nafter the full repayment of the RCF (refer to details in Note 1). As a result of the full repayment and cancellation of the\nRCF, the Company no longer has any financial covenants. However, these continue to be uncertain times and it is not\npossible to predict with certainty how certain developments will impact our liquidity position, non-financial provisions in\nour debt agreements, and our equity levels on a regular and continuous basis both at the group and operating company\nlevels. We may also be impacted by conditions or local legal requirements in international markets that could make it\nmore difficult to service our existing debt obligations or refinance existing debt. If the assumptions behind our liquidity\nforecast are not correct, we may not have sufficient liquidity to continue to operate as outlined above. If we are unable\nto raise additional capital in the markets in which we seek to raise it, or at all, or if the cost of raising additional capital\nsignificantly increases, which has been the case since the onset of the ongoing war due to monetary policy in response\nto global inflationary pressures and a number of other factors, we may be unable to make necessary or desired capital\nexpenditures, take advantage of investment opportunities, refinance existing indebtedness or meet unexpected financial\nrequirements, and our growth strategy and liquidity may be negatively affected. This could cause us to be unable to\nrepay indebtedness as it comes due, to delay or abandon anticipated expenditures and investments or otherwise limit\noperations. For example, the ongoing war in Ukraine has caused us to reconsider our capital outlay to ensure we have\nsufficient liquidity for maintenance capital expenditures and other key operational spend while at the same time\nservicing our indebtedness. As a result, capital expenditures that are more discretionary in nature may be put on hold\nuntil the impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine, and particularly its effects on our liquidity and financial profile, becomes\nmore certain.\n• In response to the geopolitical and economic situation in Ukraine, there is a risk of the country imposing external\nadministration over foreign companies or assets or nationalizing them. For example, as part of the measures that the\nUkrainian government has adopted in response to the ongoing war with Russia, several Nationalization Laws\nAmendments have been passed by the Ukrainian Parliament and, as of June 26, 2024, are awaiting signature by the\nPresident of Ukraine. Among other things, the Nationalization Laws Amendments extend the definition of “residents”\nwhose property in Ukraine (whether owned directly or indirectly) can be seized under the Nationalization Laws to\ninclude property owned by the Russian state, Russian citizens, other nationals with close relationships to Russia,\nresiding or having a main place of business in Russia, or legal entities operating in Ukraine whose founder or ultimate\nbeneficial owner is the Russian state or are controlled or managed by any of the individuals identified above. Pursuant\nto the Nationalization Laws, in May 2023, President Zelensky signed an initial package of restrictive measures relating\nto 41 entities, including against Zaporizhstal, one of Ukraine’s largest metallurgical companies, due to Russian\nownership in the company’s structure. In April 2023, the Ukrainian Parliament voted for similar measures to allow for the\nnationalization of Sense Bank, one of Ukraine’s largest commercial banks.\n• Furthermore, in November 2022, the Ukrainian government invoked martial law, which allows the Ukrainian government\nto take control of stakes in strategic companies in Ukraine in order to meet the needs of the defense sector. The\nSecurity Council Secretary indicated that at the end of the application of martial law, the assets can be returned or their\nowners can be appropriately compensated.\n• As noted above, on October 6, 2023, the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) announced that the Ukrainian courts froze\nall “corporate rights” of Mikhail Fridman in 20 Ukrainian companies in which he holds a beneficial interest, while criminal\nproceedings against Mikhail Fridman and, which are unrelated to Kyivstar or VEON, are in progress. This\nannouncement was incorrectly characterized by some Ukrainian media as a “seizure” or “freezing” of “Kyivstar’s\nassets”. On October 9, 2023, Ukrainian media further reported, with a headline which incorrectly identified Kyivstar, that\nthe Ministry of Justice of Ukraine is separately finalizing a lawsuit in the Ukraine High Anti-Corruption Court to confiscate\nany Ukrainian assets of Mikhail Fridman. We have received notification from our local custodian that the following\npercentages of the corporate rights in our Ukrainian subsidiaries have been frozen: (i) 47.85% of Kyivstar, (ii) 100% of\nUkraine Tower Company, (iii) 100% of Kyivstar.Tech, and (iv) 69.99% of Helsi Ukraine. The freezing of these corporate\nrights prevents any transactions involving our shares in such subsidiaries from proceeding.\n• If further measures are adopted and applied in relation to our Ukrainian subsidiary, this could lead to the involuntary\ndeconsolidation of our Ukrainian operations, and could trigger certain financial covenants or non-financial provisions in\n217\nour debt agreements, requiring accelerated repayment, potentially triggering a cross-default across other debt\nagreements and the revolving credit facility and negatively impact our liquidity.\nManagement’s actions to address these events and conditions are as follows:\n• As mentioned above, on October 9, 2023, the sale of our Russian operations was completed and VimpelCom was\ndeconsolidated from the VEON Group. The sale of VimpelCom has sufficiently mitigated risks related to sanctions,\ntrade restrictions, and export bans imposed against Russia as well as risks related to counter-sanctions imposed by\nRussia including Decree 302 and Decree 430. The sale of VimpelCom has also significantly reduced the VEON Group’s\nexposure to cybersecurity attacks.\n• We have implemented business continuity plans to address known contingency scenarios to ensure that we have\nadequate processes and practices in place to protect the safety of our people and to handle potential impacts to our\noperations in Ukraine.\n• The Company has performed sensitivity analyses on the volatility of the Pakistani Rupee as well as other currencies in\nour operating markets with respect to the impact on our financial results and does not expect currency fluctuations to\nhave a significant impact. In the normal course of business, the Company manages its foreign currency risk by\nselectively hedging committed exposures and hedges part of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into U.S.\ndollars of its foreign operations by holding the borrowings in foreign currencies or by foreign exchange swaps and\nforwards.\n• Management is actively monitoring any new developments in applicable sanctions to ensure that we continue to be in\ncompliance and to evaluate any potential impact on the Company’s financial performance, operations, and governance.\nManagement has actively engaged with sanctions authorities where appropriate. Management is engaging with\nauthorities in Ukraine to address any concerns they have about the ownership and management of Kyivstar and to\nprovide all necessary assurances to confirm that Russian nationals, including any beneficial owners of LetterOne, do\nnot participate in the management of Kyivstar nor are they able to derive any benefits from VEON’s assets in Ukraine.\n• On October 30, 2023, we announced that two appeals were filed with the relevant Kyiv courts, challenging the freezing\nof the corporate rights in Kyivstar and our subsidiary Ukraine Tower. Noting that corporate rights in Kyivstar and Ukraine\nTower Company belong exclusively to VEON, and that their full or partial freezing or seizure directly violates the rights\nof VEON and its international debt and equity investors, VEON requested the lifting of the freezing of its corporate rights\nin Kyivstar and Ukraine Tower Company. In its filings, the Company also reiterated that any action aimed at the rights,\nbenefits or funds of sanctioned individuals - the alleged reason for freezing of corporate rights as per the SSU statement\n- cannot legitimately be directed toward VEON or its subsidiaries. Sanctioned individuals do not own any shares in\nVEON or its subsidiaries; they cannot exercise any rights regarding VEON or any of its subsidiaries; are not a part of\nany VEON group company governance mechanisms, including boards; do not have the ability to control or influence\ndecisions made by VEON or any of its subsidiaries; and do not derive any economic benefits from VEON or any of its\noperating companies. In December 2023, the court of appeals rejected VEON’s appeals. On June 4, 2024, the CEO of\nVEON, in his capacity as a shareholder of VEON, filed a motion with Shevchenkivskiy District Court of Kyiv requesting\ncancellation of the freeze of corporate rights in the VEON group's subsidiary Ukraine Tower Company. On June 26,\n2024, the motion was supplemented to request cancellation of the freezing of corporate rights in the VEON group's\nother Ukrainian subsidiaries: Kyivstar, Kyivstar.Tech and Helsi Ukraine. VEON is continuing significant government\naffairs efforts to protest our assets in Ukraine. Based on the above development, VEON assessed whether the court\norder and subsequent motions result in an event that VEON has lost control over its Ukrainian subsidiary (“Kyivstar”)\nand concluded that, under the requirements of relevant reporting standards (IFRS 10, Consolidated financial\nStatements), VEON continues to control Kyivstar and as such, will continue to consolidate Kyivstar in these financial\nstatements.\n• Management actively monitors the Company’s liquidity position, our non-financial provisions in our debt agreements,\nand our equity levels on a regular and continuous basis both at the group and operating company levels and should\nthey reach a level considered at-risk, management will take actions to ensure our liquidity position is sufficient and our\nnon-financial provisions in our debt agreements are met.\n• On March 28, 2024, VEON announced that it repaid in full the outstanding balance of US$805 (principal, excluding\naccrued interest) and cancelled its RCF, after paying the matured portion of US$250 in February 2024.\n• As of March 14, 2024 and May 29, 2024, VEON Ltd. appointed PwC Netherlands and UHY, respectively, for the audits\nof the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the ISA Audit and PCAOB\nAudit, respectively. As a result of the delay in appointing an external independent auditor, VEON Ltd. was delayed in\nproducing its audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, filing its annual report\non Form 20-F with the SEC and filing its annual report with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (“AFM”) in\nconnection with its Euronext listing. As a result of these expected delayed filings, VEON Ltd. was not in compliance with\nits listing requirements after the applicable deadlines passed. VEON Ltd. submitted a plan to regain compliance under\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rules”) and on July 9, 2024, VEON Ltd. announced that Nasdaq granted\nthe Company an exception, enabling it to regain compliance with the Listing Rules by filing its 2023 annual report on\nForm 20-F on or before November 11, 2024. VEON Ltd. filed its 2023 annual report on Form 20-F on October 17, 2024\nand has regained compliance under the Listing Rules and filed its 2023 AFM Annual Report on October 31, 2024.\nFurther, as a result of the consent solicitation, consent was obtained to extend the deadline for the provision of audited\n218\nfinancial statements for the years ended 2023 and 2024 for both VEON Ltd. and its subsidiary, VEON Holdings B.V., to\nthe holders of the outstanding notes of VEON Holdings B.V. Refer to Note 22 for further developments and details.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In accordance with\nInternational Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, the Company has determined that the\naforementioned conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, may cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern for at least 12 months after the date these interim consolidated financial statements were authorized\nfor issuance. Management expects the actions it has taken or will take will mitigate the risk associated with the identified events\nand conditions. However, given the uncertainty and exogenous nature of the ongoing war and potential future imposed sanctions\nas well as potential new counter-sanctions, and given the possible future imposition of external administration over our Ukrainian\noperations in particular, management concluded that a material uncertainty remains related to events or conditions that may cast\nsignificant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, such that it may be unable to realize its assets and\ndischarge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\n219\n24 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements has required management to apply accounting policies and\nmethodologies based on complex and subjective judgements, as well as estimates based on past experience and assumptions\ndetermined to be reasonable and realistic based on the related circumstances. The use of these judgments, estimates and\nassumptions affects the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements. The final amounts for items for which\nestimates and assumptions were made in the consolidated financial statements may differ from those reported in these\nstatements due to the uncertainties that characterize the assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based.\nThe sources of uncertainty identified by the Group are described together with the applicable Note, as follows:\nSignificant accounting judgment / source of estimation uncertainty Described in\nRevenue recognition Note 3\nDeferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions Note 8\nProvisions and contingent liabilities Note 7\nImpairment of non-current assets Note 11\nControl over subsidiaries Note 14\nDepreciation and amortization of non-current assets Note 12 and Note 13\nFair value of financial instruments Note 16\nSale and lease back transactions Note 12\nMeasurement of lease liabilities Note 16\nNEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS\nAdopted in 2023\nA number of amended standards became effective as of January 1, 2023, which did not have a material impact on VEON\nfinancial statements. The Group has not early adopted any other standards, interpretations or amendments that have been\nissued but have not yet become effective.\nNot yet adopted by the Group\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for December 31, 2023\nreporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards are not expected to have a material impact on\nVEON financial statements in current or future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.\nAmsterdam,\nNovember 20, 2024\nVEON Holdings B.V.\n220\nCompany financial statements\nCOMPANY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nBefore appropriation of profit\nas of December 31\n(In millions of U.S. dollars) Note 2023 2022\nAssets\nNon-current assets\nFinancial fixed assets 1 5,906 6,611\nTotal non-current assets 5,906 6,611\nCurrent assets\nReceivables 2 251 1,523\nCash and cash equivalents 3 1,294 2,462\nTotal current assets 1,545 3,985\nTotal assets 7,451 10,596\nEquity and liabilities\nEquity\nIssued capital 33 32\nCapital surplus 10,294 10,294\nReserve results of subsidiaries 255 229\nForeign currency translation reserve (3,794) (6,611)\nRetained earnings / (accumulated deficit) (1,872) (1,873)\nResult for the year (2,332) 38\nTotal equity 4 2,584 2,109\nProvisions 5 162 14\nNon-current liabilities 6 2,557 4,426\nCurrent liabilities 7 2,148 4,047\nTotal equity and liabilities 7,451 10,596\nVEON Holdings B.V.

The Company has its statutory seat and\nits principal place of Business at Claude Debussylaan 88 in Amsterdam.\nThe Company is registered at the Trade Register of the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam under number 34345993.\nFor details of the Company’s and its group of companies (“VEON Group”) principal activities, reference is made to Note 1\n(General information) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES\nGeneral\nThe Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In\naccordance with the provisions of Article 362, paragraph 8, Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the accounting policies used\nare the same as those explained in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared under IFRS as endorsed by\nthe European Union, except for the accounting policies disclosed below. For an appropriate interpretation, the Company financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company financial statements are presented in United States dollars (“U.S. dollar” or “US$”). In these financial statements,\nU.S. dollar amounts are presented in millions, except as otherwise indicated.\nComparison with previous year\nThe valuation principles and method of determining the results are the same as those used in the previous year.\nSubsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are all entities (including intermediate subsidiaries) over which the Company has control. The Company controls an\nentity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect\nthose returns through its power over the subsidiary. Subsidiaries are recognized from the date on which control is transferred to\nthe Company or its intermediate holding entities. They are derecognized from the date that control ceases.\nInvestments in subsidiaries are measured at net asset value. Net asset value is based on the measurement of assets, provisions\nand liabilities and determination of profit based on the principles applied in the consolidated financial statements.\nIf the valuation of a subsidiary based on the net asset value is negative, it will be stated at nil. If and insofar as the Company can\nbe held fully or partially liable for the debts of the subsidiary or has the firm intention of enabling the participation to settle its\ndebts, a provision is recognized for this.\nNewly acquired subsidiaries are initially recognized on the basis of the fair value of their identifiable assets and liabilities at the\nacquisition date. For subsequent valuations, the principles that apply for these financial statements are used.\nThe amount by which the carrying amount of the subsidiary has changed since the previous financial statements as a result of\nthe net result achieved by the subsidiary is recognized in the income statement.\nAmounts due from investments in subsidiaries are stated initially at fair value and subsequently at amortized cost. Amortized cost\nis determined using the effective interest rate\nBusiness combinations under common control\nBusiness combinations under common control are accounted for using the carry-over accounting method. Accordingly, all assets\nand liabilities of the business acquired are recognized at the carrying value of those assets and liabilities as identified and\nmeasured in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The resulting net assets from the business combination are\nrecognized as an investment in subsidiary in the financial statements of the Company on the date of the business combination\nunder common control. The difference between the net book value of the net asset acquired and the purchase consideration paid\nis recognized directly in Equity as a contribution in kind from or a dividend to the parent company, and it is recorded as a capital\nsurplus. No goodwill or bargain purchase is recognized. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the\ncompany financial statements from the date of acquisition (i.e. no retrospective restatements in the company income statement).\nEquity interests\nFor a full list of equity interests, reference is made to the list including entity details filed in accordance with Articles 379 and 414,\nTitle 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.\nGoing Concern\nMaterial uncertainties have been identified that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern which are discussed in detail in Note 23 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nVEON Holdings B.V.

(Nasdaq: VEON, Euronext Amsterdam: VEON), a global\ndigital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services, announces selected unaudited financial and\noperating results for the third quarter and nine months ended 30 September 2024.\nIn 3Q24 VEON demonstrated robust growth, reporting an increase in revenues both in reported and local currencies. Total\nrevenues reached USD 1,038 million, an increase of 9.8% YoY in reported currency (+14.1% YoY in local currency). EBITDA\nreached USD 438 million and represented a 1.5% YoY decrease in reported currency terms (+3.5% YoY in local currency). This\nquarter's EBITDA was primarily impacted by identified items, including operational pressures in Bangladesh and restructuring\ncosts.\nCapex in 3Q24 was USD 198 million, an increase of 51.2% YoY. LTM capex increased 16.3% YoY, with LTM capex intensity of\n19.2% (+1.5 p.p. YoY). Total cash and cash equivalents as of 30 September 2024 amounted to USD 1,019 million (including USD\n143 million related to banking operations in Pakistan and excluding USD 211 million in Ukrainian sovereign bonds that are\nclassified as investments) with USD 453 million held at the HQ level.\nBlended weighted average inflation rates in the countries we operate in declined from 16.5% in Q3 2023, to 8.2% in Q3 2024,\na reduction of 830 basis points. We are encouraged to see revenue growth exceeding average inflation levels in our markets.\nFor the full year we now expect total revenue growth of 8%-10% YoY and EBITDA growth of 4%-6% YoY in USD terms, assuming\ncurrent FX rates. We are revising our prior local currency guidance, given the above considerations, to 12%-14% YoY growth\nfor total revenue, and 9%-11% YoY growth for EBITDA, in local currency terms.\nUnderlying growth in local currency, excluding identified items, is expected to be 15%-16% YoY growth in revenue, and 10-11%\nYoY growth in EBITDA. This marks a change from our previous guidance of 16-18% growth for revenue, and 18-20% growth in\nEBITDA for 2024 in local currency terms which was normalised for the Ukrainian cyberattack. In addition to deceleration in\nblended inflation rates across VEON’s operating markets, our new local currency guidance also reflects the business impact of\ncivil unrest in Bangladesh and the sale of the TNS+ infrastructure asset in Kazakhstan.\nKaan Terzioğlu commented on the results:\n“\nI am pleased to report a 14% YoY increase in revenue in local currency terms, exceeding the 8% blended inflation across our markets. Despite\nthe impact of the civil unrest in Bangladesh, the sale of the TNS+ infrastructure asset in Kazakhstan, and with current currency levels in mind,\nwe expect to finish the year with solid revenue growth of 8 to 10% in USD terms.\nThis achievement highlights our rapid expansion and innovation, supported by 8 million new 4G subscribers and 103 million digital service\nusers. Direct digital revenues, now comprising 12% of our total revenue for the quarter, grew by 35% year-over-year. These gains, stemming\nfrom digital financial services, entertainment, healthcare, advertising, and super-apps, are not only enhancing user engagement and retention\nbut also significantly boosting our ARPU and contributing directly to our top-line growth through diverse streams like interest income,\nadvertising revenues, subscription services, platform commissions, and pay-per-view revenues.\nLooking forward, I am enthusiastic about the future as we continue to drive growth and enrich customer experiences through advanced digital\nofferings and cutting-edge technologies like augmented intelligence. This approach not only cements our position at the forefront of the digital\n“\nrevolution but also ensures sustained growth and success in rapidly evolving frontier markets.\nVEON Group YoY YoY YoY YoY\n3Q24 3Q23 9M24 9M23\nUSD, million Reported LCY Reported LCY\nTotal revenue, of which: 1 ,038 9 45 9 .8% 1 4.1% 3 ,006 2 ,745 9 .5% 1 3.6%\nTelecom and infrastructure revenue 9 16 8 55 7 .2% 1 2.2% 2 ,673 2 ,506 6 .7% 1 1.1%\nDirect digital revenue 1 21 9 0 3 5.1% 3 2.6% 3 34 2 39 3 9.5% 4 0.4%\nEBITDA 4 38 4 44 ( 1.5%) 3 .5% 1 ,283 1 ,245 3 .0% 7 .4%\nCapex 1 98 1 31 5 1.2% 5 04 3 93 2 8.3%\nLTM capex intensity 19.2% 17.8% 1 .5p.p.\nEquity Free Cash Flow 1 42 1 79 ( 20.3%) 3 09 3 01 2 .8%\nCash and cash equivalents 1 ,019 2 ,249 ( 54.7%)\nCash and cash equivalents at HQ level 4 53 1 ,753 ( 74.1%)\nNet debt 3 ,114 2 ,135 4 5.9%\nNet debt, excluding leases 2 ,100 1 ,272 6 5.1%\nCustomers (millions)\nMobile customers 1 54.2 1 56.1 ( 1.2%)\nDigital MAU 1 02.9 9 3.8 9 .7%\nFixed-line customers 1 .8 1 .8 1 .4%\nOperational metrics\n4G users (millions) 9 9.9 9 2.8 7 .7%\n4G user penetration 64.8% 59.4% 5 .4p.p.\nNote: Cash and cash equivalents includes USD 143 million relating to banking operations in Pakistan.

We generally calculate\nmobile ARPU by dividing our mobile service revenue during the relevant period (including data revenue, roaming\nrevenue, MFS and interconnect revenue, but excluding revenue from connection fees, sales of handsets and\naccessories and other non-service revenue) by the average number of our mobile customers during the period and\nthe number of months in that period.\nCapital expenditures (capex) are purchases of property and equipment, new construction, upgrades, software,\nother long-lived assets and related reasonable costs incurred prior to the intended use of the non-current asset,\naccounted at the earliest event of advance payment or delivery. Purchases of licenses and capitalized leases are not\nincluded in capital expenditures.\nCapex intensity is a ratio, which is calculated as last-twelve-months (LTM) capex divided by LTM total revenue.\nDirect digital revenues include revenues from VEON’s proprietary digital platforms and services.\nDiscontinued operations under IFRS refers to a component of an entity, representing a major line of business or a\ngeographic area of operations, that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. As presented in the\ndocument, the results of discontinued operations that are presented separately, either in the current and/or prior\nyear income statements, have no impact on balance sheet amounts of the prior periods. This means that neither the\nAlgerian nor Russian operations contribute to the base performance of VEON for both the current and prior year\nshown.\nDoubleplay 4G customers are mobile customers who engaged in usage of our voice and data services over 4G (LTE)\ntechnology at any time during the one month prior to such measurement date.\nEBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and is called Adjusted EBITDA in the 2023 Form 20-F published by VEON.\nVEON calculates Adjusted EBITDA as (loss)/profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, impairment, gain/loss\non disposals of non-current assets, other non-operating gains/losses and share of profit/loss of joint ventures and\nassociates. Our Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful in evaluating our performance against other telecommunications\ncompanies that provide EBITDA. Additionally, a limitation of EBITDA’s use as a performance measure is that it does\nnot reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue or the\nneed to replace capital equipment over time.\nEBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by total revenue, expressed as a percentage.\nEquity free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure and is defined as free cash flow from operating activities less cash flow\nused in investing activities, excluding license payments, principal amount of lease payments, balance movements in\nPakistan banking, M&A transactions, inflow/outflow of deposits, financial assets and other one-off items.\nGross debt is calculated as the sum of long-term notional debt and short-term notional debt, including capitalised\nleases.\nIdentified items are amounts impacting revenues and/or EBITDA, that may be recurring in nature, but are not\noperational. Underlying revenues and/or EBITDA exclude such identified items.\nLocal currency (or “LCY”) trends (growth/decline) in revenue and EBITDA are non-IFRS financial measures that\nreflect changes in Revenue and EBITDA, excluding foreign currency movements (“constant FX”) and other factors,\nsuch as businesses under liquidation, disposals, mergers and acquisitions, including the classification of Russia as\n‘discontinued operations’. LCY trends underlying (growth/decline) is an alternative performance measure that is\ncalculated as local currency trends excluding identified items with an absolute amount of USD 5 million or more.\n24\nTrading update\nQ3 2024\nMobile customers (also - mobile subscribers) are generally customers in the registered customer base at a given\nmeasurement date who engaged in a mobile revenue generating activity at any time during the three months prior\nto such measurement date. Such activity includes any outgoing calls, customer fee accruals, debits related to service,\noutgoing SMS and MMS, data transmission and receipt sessions, but does not include incoming calls, SMS and MMS\nor abandoned calls. Our total number of mobile customers also includes customers using mobile internet service via\nUSB modems and fixed-mobile convergence (“FMC”).\nMobile data customers (also – mobile data subscribers) are mobile customers who have engaged in revenue-\ngenerating activity during the three months prior to the measurement date as a result of activities including USB\nmodem Internet access using 2.5G/3G/4G/HSPA+ technologies.\nMobile financial services (“MFS”) or digital financial services (“DFS”) are a variety of innovative services, such\nas mobile commerce, which uses a mobile phone as the primary payment user interface and allows mobile customers\nto conduct money transfers to pay for items such as goods at an online store, utility payments, fines and state fees,\nloan repayments, domestic and international remittances, mobile insurance and tickets for air and rail travel, all via\ntheir mobile phone.\nMultiplay customers are doubleplay 4G customers who also engaged in usage of one or more of our digital\nproducts at any time during the one month prior to such measurement date.\nNet debt is a non-IFRS financial measure and is calculated as the sum of interest-bearing long-term debt, including\ncapitalized leases (unless specifically excluded) and short-term notional debt minus cash and cash equivalents,\nexcluding cash and cash deposits from our banking operations in Pakistan, long-term and short-term deposits. We\nbelieve that net debt provides useful information to investors because it shows the amount of notional debt that\nwould be outstanding if available cash and cash equivalents and long-term and short-term deposits were applied to\nrepay such indebtedness. Net debt should not be considered in isolation as an alternative to long-term debt and\nshort-term debt, or any other measure of our financial position.\nNet Promoter Score (“NPS”) is the methodology VEON uses to measure customer satisfaction. Relative NPS (rNPS)\n– advantage or gap in NPS when compared to competition.\nRevenues from telecommunications services and from infrastructure (“Telecom and infrastructure\nrevenues” or “Telecom and infra revenues”) are revenues generated by VEON from providing telecommunication\nand infrastructure services. Telecommunication services refer to data, voice, connectivity, television, and similar\nservices, regardless of medium of transmission, including transmission by satellite. Infrastructure services refer to\nleasing or providing third-party access to physical network assets, such as towers and fiber-optic lines, owned by\nVEON, allowing external entities to utilize these resources.\nTotal digital monthly active users (“MAU”) is a gross total cumulative MAU of all digital platforms, services and\napplications offered by an entity or by the Group and includes MAU who are active in more than one application.\nVEON’s reportable segments are the following, which are principally based on business activities in different\ngeographical areas: Pakistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh and Uzbekistan. We also present our results of\noperations for “Others” and “HQ” separately, although these are not reportable segments. “Others” represents our\noperations in Kyrgyzstan and “HQ” represents transactions related to management activities within the group in\nAmsterdam, London and Dubai.\n25\nTrading update\nQ3 2024\nATTACHMENT B: CUSTOMERS\n26\nU\nP\nK\nB\nU\nK\nT\nk ra in e\na k is ta n\na z a k h s ta n\na n g la d e s h\nz b e k is ta n\ny rg y z s ta n\no ta l\n3 Q 2 4\n2 3 .3\n7 1 .6\n1 1 .6\n3 7 .8\n8 .2\n1 .7\n1 5 4 .2\n2 Q 2 4\n2 3 .4\n7 1 .4\n1 1 .4\n4 1 .3\n8 .1\n1 .8\n1 5 7 .4\nM o b ile\nQ o Q\n(0 .5 %\n0 .3 %\n2 .2 %\n(8 .6 %\n1 .0 %\n(1 .1 %\n(2 .0 %\n)\n)\n)\n)\n3 Q 2 3\n2 4 .1\n7 0 .5\n1 1 .0\n3 9 .9\n8 .7\n1 .9\n1 5 6 .1\nY\n(3 .3\n1 .6\n5 .9\n(5 .4\n(6 .0\n(7 .4\n(1 .2\no\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nY\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n3 Q 2 4\n1 .1\n0 .7\n1 .8\n2\nF ix\nQ 2 4\n1 .1\n0 .7\n1 .8\ne d -lin e b ro a\nQ o Q\n(1 .6 %\n3 .8 %\n0 .4 %\nd\n)\nb a n d\n3 Q 2 3\n1 .1\n0 .7\n1 .8\nY\n(1 .8\n6 .7\n1 .4\no Y\n% )\n%\n%\nATTACHMENT C: RECONCILIATION TABLES\nRECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED EBITDA TO PROFIT/(LOSS) FOR THE PERIOD\nUSD million, unaudited 3Q24 3Q23 9M24 9M23\nEBITDA 4 38 4 44 1 ,283 1 ,245\nDepreciation ( 132) ( 136) ( 396) ( 396)\nAmortization ( 50) ( 52) ( 149) ( 156)\nImpairment (loss)/gain ( 1) 1 ( 2) 1 1\n(Loss)/gain on disposals of non-current assets ( 0) 1 ( 2) 2\nGain/(loss) on disposals of subsidiaries 1 46 ( 0) 1 46 ( 0)\nOperating profit 4 02 2 59 8 80 7 06\nFinancial income and expenses: ( 112) ( 116) ( 340) ( 363)\n⎼ Including finance income 1 1 1 6 3 2 4 9\n⎼ Including finance expenses ( 123) ( 132) ( 372) ( 412)\nNet foreign exchange (loss)/gain and others: 5 4 1 1 5 6 4\n⎼ Including other non-operating gains/(losses) 3 2 2 3 1 7\n⎼ Including net foreign exchange (loss)/gain 3 3 9 ( 8) 4 8\nProfit before tax from continuing operations 2 95 1 84 5 55 4 08\nIncome tax (expense)/gain ( 69) ( 53) ( 162) ( 116)\nProfit/(loss) from continuing operations 2 26 1 31 3 94 2 92\nProfit/(loss) from discontinued operations -

We generally calculate mobile ARPU by dividing our mobile service revenue during the relevant period (including data revenue, roaming revenue, MFS and interconnect\nrevenue, but excluding revenue from connection fees, sales of handsets and accessories and other non-service revenue), by the average number of our mobile customers during the period and the number of months in that period.\nCapital expenditures (“capex”) are purchases of property and equipment, new construction, upgrades, software, other long-lived assets and related reasonable costs incurred prior to intended use of the non-current asset, accounted at the earliest event of advance\npayment or delivery. Purchase of licenses and capitalised leases are not included in capital expenditures.\nCapex intensity is a ratio, which is calculated as last-twelve-months (LTM) capex divided by LTM total revenue.\nDirect digital revenues include revenues from VEON’s proprietary digital platforms and services.\nDiscontinued operations under IFRS refers to a component of an entity, representing a major line of business or a geographic area of operations, that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. As presented in the document, the results of\ndiscontinued operations that are presented separately either in the current and/or prior year income statements, have no impact on balance sheet amounts of the prior periods. This means that neither the Algerian nor Russian operations contribute to the base\nperformance of VEON for both the current and prior year shown.\nDoubleplay 4G customers are mobile B2C customers who engaged in usage of our voice and data services over 4G (LTE) technology at any time during the one month prior to such measurement date.\nEBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and is called “Adjusted EBITDA” in the Form 20-F published by VEON. VEON calculates Adjusted EBITDA as (loss)/profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, impairment, gain/loss on disposals of non-current assets,\nother non-operating gains/losses and share of profit/loss of joint ventures and associates. Our Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful in evaluating our performance against other telecommunications companies that provide EBITDA. Additionally, a limitation of EBITDA’s use\nas a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalised tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue or the need to replace capital equipment over time.\nEBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by total revenue, expressed as a percentage.\nEquity free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure and is defined as free cash flow from operating activities less cash flow used in investing activities excluding license payments, principal amount of lease payments, balance movements in Pakistan banking, M&A\ntransactions, inflow/outflow of deposits, financial assets and other identified items.\nGross debt is calculated as the sum of long-term notional debt and short-term notional debt including capitalised leases.\nIdentified items are amounts impacting revenues and/or EBITDA, that may be recurring in nature, but are not operational. Underlying revenues and/or EBITDA exclude such identified items.\nLocal currency (or “LCY”) trends (growth/decline) in revenue and EBITDA are non-IFRS financial measures that reflect changes in Revenue and EBITDA, excluding foreign currency movements (“constant FX”) and other factors, such as businesses under liquidation,\ndisposals, mergers and acquisitions, including the classification of Russia as discontinued operations. Local currency (or “LCY”) trends underlying (growth/decline) iis an alternative performance measure that is calculated as local currency trends excluding identified\nitems with an absolute amount of USD 5 million or more.\nMobile customers are generally customers in the registered customer base at a given measurement date who engaged in a mobile revenue generating activity at any time during the three months prior to such measurement date. Such activity includes any outgoing\ncalls, customer fee accruals, debits related to service, outgoing SMS and MMS, data transmission and receipt sessions, but does not include incoming calls, SMS and MMS or abandoned calls. Our total number of mobile customers also includes customers using mobile\ninternet service via USB modems and fixed-mobile convergence (“FMC”).\nMobile data customers are mobile customers who have engaged in revenue-generating activity during the three months prior to the measurement date as a result of activities including USB modem Internet access using 2.5G/3G/4G/HSPA+ technologies.\nMobile financial services (“MFS”) or digital financial services (“DFS”) is a variety of innovative services, such as mobile commerce that uses a mobile phone as the primary payment user interface and allows mobile customers to conduct money transfers to pay for\nitems such as goods at an online store, utility payments, fines and state fees, loan repayments, domestic and international remittances, mobile insurance and tickets for air and rail travel, all via their mobile phone.\nMultiplay customers are doubleplay 4G customers who also engaged in usage of one or more of our digital products at any time during the one month prior to such measurement date.\nNet debt is a non-IFRS financial measure and is calculated as the sum of interest-bearing long-term debt including capitalised leases and short-term notional debt minus cash and cash equivalents excluding cash and cash deposits from our banking operations in\nPakistan, long-term and short-term deposits. We believe that net debt provides useful information to investors because it shows the amount of notional debt that would be outstanding if available cash and cash equivalents and long-term and short-term deposits were\napplied to repay such indebtedness. Net debt should not be considered in isolation as an alternative to long-term debt and short-term debt, or any other measure of our financial position.\nNet Promoter Score (“NPS”) is the methodology VEON uses to measure customer satisfaction. Relational NPS (rNPS) – advantage or gap in NPS compared to competition.\nRevenues from telecommunications services and from infrastructure (“Telecom and infrastructure revenues” or “Telecom and infra revenues”) are revenues generated by VEON from providing telecommunication and infrastructure services.\nTelecommunication services refer to data, voice, connectivity, television, and similar services, regardless of medium of transmission, including transmission by satellite. Infrastructure services refer to leasing or providing third-party access to physical network\nassets, such as towers and fiber-optic lines, owned by VEON, allowing external entities to utilize these resources.\nTotal digital monthly active users (“MAU”) is a gross total cumulative MAU of all digital platforms, services and applications offered by an entity or by VEON Group and includes MAU who are active in more than one application..\nVEON’s reportable segments are the following, which are principally based on business activities in different geographical areas: Pakistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Bangladesh. We also present our results of operations for “Others” and “HQ” separately,\nalthough these are not reportable segments. “Others” represents our operations in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia (which now contributes only to first six months of 2022 results) and “HQ” represents transactions related to management activities within the group in\nAmsterdam, London and Dubai.\n48\nThe comparative information for the Group is restated following the sale of Russian operations announced on 24 November 2022, in line with the requirements of IFRS 5\n3Q24 trading update |48"

          "content": "Q3 2024 Trading Update\nNovember 14, 2024\nOperator:\nHello and welcome to Veon's Q3 2024 trading update call. We ask that you please hold all questions\nuntil the completion of the formal remark, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question\nand answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any\nobjections, please disconnect at this time. Faisal Ghori, you may begin.\nFaisal Ghori:\nThank you. Good afternoon and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us today for\nVeon's third quarter results presentation for the period ending September 30, 2024. I'm Faisal Ghori,\nHead of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined in the room today by Kaan Terzioglu, our group CFO,\nalong with Joop Brakenhoff, our group CFO. Today's presentation will begin with the key highlights and\nbusiness updates from Kaan, followed by discussion of detailed financial results by Joop. We will then\nopen up the line for Q&A.\nBefore getting started, I would like to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during\ntoday's presentation, which involves certain risks and uncertainties. These statements relating partly to\nthe company's anticipated performance and guidance for 2024, future market developments and\ntrends, operational network developments, network investments, and the company's ability to realize\nits targets in commercial and strategic initiatives, including current and future transactions. Certain\nfactors may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements,\nincluding the risk detail in the company's annual report on Form 20F and other recent public filings\nmade by the company with the SEC. The earnings release and the earnings presentation, each of which\ninclude reconciliations of non IFRS measures presented today can be downloaded from our website.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Kaan.\nKaan Terzioğlu:\nThank you, Faisal. Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to everyone. I appreciate you joining us\ntoday for Veon's presentation of Q3 results for 24. Today, I'm hosting the call from Dubai, our\ndesignated HQ, as the largest Nasdaq listed company headquartered in Dubai once the transition is\ncompleted over the next couple of weeks. I am thankful for the Dubai authorities, especially his\nExcellency Minister of Economy, Mr. Almari, for proving how welcoming Dubai is and why it is so easy to\ndo business in this wonderful country. I would like to also remind you that the last day of trading of our\nstock on the Euronext Exchange in Amsterdam will be November 22nd. And as of November 25th, Veon\nstock will be exclusively traded on Nasdaq Stock Exchange. This will position Veon as a frontier markets\nbellwether for US investors who wish to participate in extraordinary growth of Central and South Asia.\nPage 1 of 8\nGoing to the quarterly results, another strong billion dollar quarter growing well above nominal GDP\ngrowth. In the third quarter of 2024, we grew revenues by 9.8% year-over-year in US dollar, and 14.1%\nin local currency terms. Underlying growth, taking into account the impact of the Bangladesh\nRevolution, will be 16% year-over-year in underlying local currency terms. As a note, the weighted\naverage blended inflation rate across our markets has decelerated from 16.5% in Q3 2023 to 8.2% as of\nnow, marking a substantial reduction of 830 basis points, while weighted average blended GDP growth\nhas stayed over 3.4% over the same period. Against this backdrop, our revenue growth underscores\nVeon growing faster than both inflation and nominal GDP and thereby, gaining wallet share. Group\nEBITDA decreased 1.5% year-on-year in US dollars, and increased 3.5% in local currency. EBITDA\nperformance was impacted by certain identified items. Such as pre-revolution disruption of business and\npost-revolution economic progress impact in Bangladesh, restructuring cost associated with the HQ\nrelocation to Dubai and charitable donations. Excluding the identified items, underlying EBITDA growth\nin local currency terms would have been 9.8% in local currency and 4.4% in US dollars.\nDuring our presentation, in the next slide you will see, we will concentrate on US dollar growth rates at\nthe corporate level and local currency growth rates at the OPCO level. In Q3 2024, the growth overall\nwas 9.8%. If you look into the breakdown of this growth, you'll see that our telecom and infrastructure\nrevenues combined grew 7.2% year-on-year, while our direct digital revenues grew 35.1% year-on-year\nin US dollars. Our EBITDA growth for the period was -1. 5%, as mentioned, impacted by identified items\namounting to $36 million as previously defined. Excluding those identified items, underlying EBITDA\ngrowth would have been 4.5% in US dollars.\nWe ended Q3 with a cash position of $1 billion, of which 453 million is held at headquarters level. Gross\ndebt is down 8% year-on-year, demonstrating effective cash management. Capital expenditures\nincreased in Q3 51.2% year-on-year, reflecting our inability to import equipment to Pakistan in Q# last\nyear due to macroeconomic conditions. CapEx intensity on a last 12-month basis for the period was 19.\n2%, higher compared to last year by 1.5 percentage points.\nNow I will provide a brief overview of our revenue and EBITDA growth across the portfolio of our\noperations. In Ukraine, revenues grew 17.9% year-on-year and EBITDA increased 6.9% in Q3. This truly\nreflects our team's dedication to keeping Ukraine and its citizens connected, while also maintaining a\nrobust business performance. In our Central and South Asian markets, local currency revenue growth for\nthe year remained robust. Pakistan led the growth with a revenue growth of 22.6% year-on-year, while\nKazakhstan's growth was 14.8 and Uzbekistan's growth was 15.2, as revenues in Bangladesh declined\n8.4% due to the revolution as I explained earlier. On EBITDA, Uzbekistan led at 15% growth, Pakistan by\n14.7. Finally, Ukraine at 6.9. EBITDA growth was -5.9 in Kazakhstan and -4% in Bangladesh. I will run\nthrough the drivers in each case as I brief you on the countries.\nMoving on, I would like to outline some important operational metrics. We added 8 million additional\n4G customers year-on-year and grew multiplay customers by additional 4 million. 4G penetration rose\nsix percentage points to 65%, bringing us closer to our group target of 70. As we develop digital services\nacross our market, there are two important growth vectors to take note. As you can see here, first\nvector is about existing connectivity business grows faster due to greater customer data consumption,\nimproved retention and ARPU expansion. Consequently, the longer a user stays as a multiplay customer\nconsuming one of our digital services, the greater the ARPU they produce.\nFor example, in Bangladesh, multiplayer users that are with us less than three months generate 3.1\ntimes the ARPU as they stay with us over 12 months. ARPU jumps 5.3 times. We see compounding effect\nof our 4G for All and digital operator strategies in our multiplayer segment. Expanding 4G access enables\nus to convert more single player users to multiplay subscribers, who use both 4G connectivity for their\nconnectivity needs and digital products. They spend more time with us, they churn less and they drive\nPage 2 of 8\nhigher revenue generation. In Q3, more than half of our revenues were generated by multiplay\ncustomers with a growth of 31% year-on-year. Why this is important? Greater digital product adoption\nacross our operating companies deepens our force and increases usage in our core connectivity\nbusiness. By continuing to focus on customer retention and expanding our multiple offerings, we drive\nfurther growth and profitability.\nNow about the second vector of growth about our digital services, which shows itself in our direct digital\nrevenues. Let me talk about that next.\nDirect digital revenues are revenues generated through digital financial services, entertainment services,\nhealthcare services, advertising, super apps, and enterprise services. These are also driving additional\nrevenue streams such as advertising revenues, in-app purchases, interest income, and also additional\nsubscriber revenues.\nThese revenues are not included in our telecom business but accounted for separately. These revenues\nin the first nine months of 2024 reached 334 million, making up 11% of our total revenues up from 10%\nin the first six months of 2024 as we started to share with you. This 11% of our revenues grow 40% year-\non-year in local currency. Diversification into multiple digital verticals allow us to serve unmet market\ndemand and expand our customer base, reducing dependency on a single revenue stream.\nOur investments in enterprise digital services such as AdTech, Cloud services and software development\nare paying off, positioning us to seize new market opportunities. Looking forward, we are committed to\nenhancing our digital offerings and expanding our presence in these key verticals, driving growth and\ndelivering value to our shareholders. I will touch on each one of these adjacent verticals later on my\npresentation.\nLet's look at our markets and start with Kiev Star In Ukraine. Kyivstar continues to generate strong\ngrowth. Revenues for Kyivstar increased almost 18% year-on-year in local currency. Despite the limited\ndigital portfolio in Ukraine, digital revenues reached 2.2% of total revenues and grew five times since\nlast year this time. EBITDA grew by 7% due to operational cost increases in support of the war and\nongoing network and utility cost pressures. We are actively managing operational efficiency by\noptimizing network, IT support services, and working with our competition for shared services.\nOur CapEx is up by 63% in Ukraine year-on-year, as we ensure network resilience with power storage\nand generation capacities installed across key sites. These investments include deploying over 2300\ngenerators and 124,000 4-hour duration batteries at base stations to ensure continuous service during\nblackouts. Additionally, we plan to deploy around another 850 generators and 60,000 more batteries.\nMoving to Pakistan. Actually, I'm just back from a eight-day trip from Pakistan, including Karachi and\nIslamabad, and I'm glad to report to you that the seriousness of the government in terms of their\ndiscipline in executing IMF program is remarkable as well as the 18 months of stability of the foreign\ncurrency rates. I had the opportunity to talk with the Governor of Central Bank, Prime Minister, Finance\nMinister, ICT Minister, as well as other government authorities, and the resolute that I observed gives\nme a lot of confidence.\nMoving to Jazz. Jazz continues its strong growth trajectory with revenue growing 22.6% year-on-year\nand EBITDA growing 14.7% growth year-on-year. Pakistan is furthest along its digital operator journey\nwith direct digital revenues now reaching 26% of total revenues growing 27.2% year-on-year. EBITDA\ngrew 14.7% with lower margins, reflecting the impact of a higher proportion of non telecom services\nand growth investments into enterprise and other digital services. We expect to see total to sales ratio\ntrending lower as well, resulting CapEx in higher free cash flow generation. CapEx increased 99% year-\non-year as Jazz continued to expand and upgrade its 4G network. Please note that this 99% increase is\nPage 3 of 8\nreflection of inability to import equipment last year at the same time. This reverse has previously\ndelayed given macroeconomic constraints.\nMoving to Kazakhstan. Beeline, Kazakhstan is another outlier in terms of digital operator performance.\nTotal revenues are up by 14.8% while telecom revenues grew 14.1, digital direct revenues grew 25.4\nyear over year, reaching 10% of our total revenue base. This quarter, as part of our charitable donation\nprogram in the country where we commit 1% of our total revenues every year into our foundation called\nJili Jirek, we proudly completed the inauguration of a newly constructed secondary school in Kazakhstan\nwith high-end technology facilities. Excluding the charitable donation and an exceptional item from Q3\nlast year, Beeline Kazakhstan's underlying EBITDA would have grown by 10%.\nCapEx for the quarter was 26.6 billion tenge increasing 78.2% year-on-year. We are addressing the\nunderlying demand and entrenching our network leadership in the country. Our massive MIMO\ninitiatives and 4.9G rollout allows us to maintain network leadership and effectively competing with\noperators with so-called 5G Services.\nNow moving into Bangladesh, let me be very clear. Our commitment to Bangladesh is unwavering. We\ncontinue to see our long-term opportunities in the country as very exciting. However, the pre-revolution\ndisruption and post-revolution economic impact has also impacted our performance in the quarter.\nBanglalink revenues decreased 8.4% in Q3 impacted also by a new tax on revenues. EBITDA decreased\nby 4% year over year as cost reduction initiatives mitigated some of the revenue pressure and offset by\nhigher electricity and network expansion costs. Banglalink's capital expenditures were 2 billion taka, a\n7.5% year-on-year decline, reflecting the completion of our 4G network rollout during 2022 and '23.\nTurning now to Beeline Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan achieved 15% year-over-year local currency top line\ngrowth driven by increased 4G subscribers and higher demand for Beeline's data and digital services\nsupporting an ARPU growth of 21% year-on-year. Direct digital revenues in the quarters increased by\n67% and reached 3.8% of total revenues. EBITDA for Beeline Uzbekistan increased by 15% despite higher\nenergy tariffs and increased network expansion costs. CapEx reached 131 billion sums, an increase of\n36.3% year-on-year and reflecting about ongoing upgrades and expansions to our network.\nLooking into our DO1440, Digital Operator 1,440 minutes strategic development, we are now reaching\n103 million customers on our digital service platforms. I expect this number of digital subscribers to\ncontinue growing strongly, eventually exceeding our traditional telecom customer base. We aim to be in\nthe lives of our customers in key verticals from entertainment, financial services, health technologies,\nand education technologies.\nAs I did last quarter, I want to talk also a little bit about augmented intelligence, the way we define AI for\na moment. We have already developed over this quarter a Kazakh language LLM in Kazakhstan, in\npartnership with the GSMA and Barcelona Supercomputing Center. We have also announced a program\nwith Nast in Pakistan to start developing local language models in Pakistan. This is what we are doing to\ndo this in all markets to ensure our markets and customers are not left behind the augmented\nintelligence revolution. There is nothing artificial about AI. There is a way of using augmented\nintelligence purposefully. I cannot see a better value proposition than offering a better version of\nthemselves for our customers.\nLet's now have a look to some of these different digital revenue streams. Let me start with our mobile\nfinancial services, digital financial services, where we have three important digital assets. Pakistan\nJazzCash, Kazakhstan Simply, and Uzbekistan Beepul. We have now a total customer base, across\nfinancial services platforms, of almost 23 million, which has increased 39% year on year. Last 12 month\nnumber of transactions, number of transactions, reached 2.7 billion, growing 30%. In Pakistan, total\nfinancial revenues grew 74% year on year, driven by a 59% increase in gross transaction value to $30\nbillion equivalent, which is 8.4 trillion rupees. The high growth was supported by continued expansion of\nPage 4 of 8\nJazzCash's retail distribution network, now reaching more than 400,000 agents and merchants end of\nQ3. We are now issuing more than 117,000 loans every single day, reaching 19 million customers.\nAnother strong contributor to mobile financial services strategy is Simply in Kazakhstan. This is the first\nand leading digital payment card. We are seeing a healthy adoption of this service, with monthly active\nusers increasing seven times, year on year, to 2.3 million. Simply has processed over 100 million\ntransactions over the last 12 months, up 81%, and translated to a doubling of gross transaction value of\nmore than a billion dollars or 643 billion Kazakh tenge.\nBeepul, Uzbekistan's digital financial services platform also has doubled its customer base to 1.3 million\nover the last year.\nLet's move to our entertainment platforms. We are now offering services in Pakistan, Bangladesh,\nKazakhstan, and Ukraine as OTT streaming services and IPTV offerings. Across this vertical, we serve\nnearly 20 million customers in the quarter. Our growth in the quarter was impacted by the ending of ICC\nCricket tournament in our largest countries. Tamasha's customer base declined, given the fact that the\nICC Cricket tournament had an impact over last year. These users' sessions showing 15% decrease\nshould not discourage you from saying that the business is slowing down. On the contrary, we see a very\nstrong pickup and conclusion of ICT tournament, which will result in the new cycle, another hike on user\nnumbers. Over the past year, Tamasha has attracted over 50 international and local advertisers,\npositioning itself as a top choice for brand partnerships in the country's local OTT space. We have\ngenerated close to 146 million rupees in advertising revenues this quarter. Toffee, also reflecting the\nsame decline for the same reason, is around 6.1 million active users. Similar to Tamasha, this is the\nresult of the ICC Cricket tournament finishing. And Toffee also, similar to Tamasha, continues to\ngenerate advertising revenues.\nMoving to our super apps and second brands. Our super apps are no longer serving just our telecom\ncustomers. They are open platforms for every single citizen. In addition to offering self-care to our\ncustomers, these super apps offer wide variety of services to everybody, including healthcare,\neducation, entertainment, e-commerce, transportation charges, in a single easy to use platform. We are\nnow serving almost 38 million customers, growing 12% year on year.\nOur second, or the way we call it, the lifestyle brands are catered to younger customers. And we've just\nbegun launching them over the past 12 months. Our most recent launch was RYZE in Bangladesh, just\nlaunched a couple of days ago, symbolizing post-revolution rise of the country with an unmatched\nentertainment carrier. Across them, we are now reaching 1.3 million customers. Let me highlight the\nnotable performance of ROX in Pakistan, which boasts over 460, 000 monthly active users, and achieves\nan average ARPU that is 45% higher that of Jazz, even not one year past launching the service.\nSimilarly, IZI in Kazakhstan grew its space by 43% year on year, and reached 680,000 users. Notably,\nnearly half of its customers are not Beeline customers. It is attracting customers from other operators,\nand it has the highest Net Promoter Score, and much higher ARPU.\nLet me also turn to HELSI in Ukraine, our exceptional healthcare service platform, almost with the\npopulation equivalent of users registered on it, 28 million. HELSI continues to be the furthest along in\nterms of our digital healthcare offerings. Across the portfolio, it provides online consultations with\nmedical professionals, and is a vital part of Kyivstar's digital operator portfolio. The registered patients is\nup 8%, reaching 28 million. And please take into consideration the total population of 38 million in\nUkraine. It penetrates 74% of the country. HELSI has access to almost 1,600 active healthcare\ninstitutions, up 10%, more than 39,000 healthcare specialists, up 12%. In Q3, we facilitated\napproximately 2.2 million appointments through the platform, a 20% increase. Our recently launched AI-\nbased subscription service now serves 33,000 customers, demonstrating the great potential of the\nplatform. With that, I will hand over to Joop.\nPage 5 of 8\nJoop Brakenhoff:\nThank you, Kaan. For the recent quarter, we've achieved double-digit year on year growth in local\ncurrency revenues across our six markets, with total revenue growing 40% year on year, and digital\nrevenue growing 33% year on year. Our reported revenue on US dollar basis increased 9.8% year on\nyear. This performance is despite the revolution in Bangladesh. The driving forces behind our revenue\ngrowth include gains in market share and the expansion of our digital platforms across all operations,\ncoupled with the implementation of disciplined inflationary pricing strategies. Excluding identified items,\nunderlying group revenue would've increased by 60% year over year in constant currency. We're also\nseeing positive macroeconomic tailwinds in our markets business, assisting in our growth.\nTurning our attention to our EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Group EBITDA increased by 3.5% year on year\nin local currency terms, reaching $438 million, and declined by 1.5% in reporting currency. Our EBITDA\nmargin stood at 42.2%, a decrease of 4.9 percentage points. Our EBITDA growth was impacted by\nidentified items in Bangladesh, and cost associated with researching at our HQ. Excluding these\nidentified items, underlying group EBITDA would've increased by 9.8% year over year in constant\ncurrency.\nShifting focus to key balance sheet figures. As we close the quarter, the group maintained a healthy\nliquidity position, with a cash reserve of $1 billion, plus 80% year on year. Of this amount, 453 million is\nheld at our headquarters. In the first nine months of 2024, net dividends upstream for OpCos amounted\nto $396 million, strengthening our financial position.\nTurning now to our debt profile, our average cost of debt is now just under 10%, and reflects the\nblended rate of borrowing in our market currencies. Apart from some insignificant other facilities,\nPakistani rupee debt generally has the highest cost, and is about 28% of our total group debt, excluding\nleases.Our average debt maturity is not 2.7 years, 3.3 years if we includes our lease liabilities.\nTurning to our debt maturity schedule. We have no material maturities anymore in 2024, only smaller\nmaturities at our operating subsidiaries. At HQ, the nearest maturity is in April 2025. Let me hand it back\nto Kaan.\nKaan Terzioğlu:\nThank you very much, Joop. Let me start looking to the 2024 outlook. Blended weighted average\ninflation rates in the countries that we operate has declined from 16.5% in Q3 2023 to 8.2% in Q3 2024,\na reduction of 830 basis points. At the same time. Blended weighted average real GDP growth in our\nmarkets is around 3.4% for the period. As a result, six weeks to the end of the year, for the full year, we\nnow expect total revenue growth of eight to 10% year-on-year growth in US dollars and NABTA growth\nof 46% in US dollar terms. Assuming current foreign currency rates. We are revising our prior local\ncurrency guidance on this call given above considerations to 12 to 14% year-on-year growth for total\nrevenue and 9 to 11% year-on-year growth for EBITDA in local currency terms. Taking into consideration\nthe identified items that we have mentioned, underlying growth in local currency is expected to be\n15.7% growth in revenue and 11.2% growth in EBITDA. This marks a change from our previous guidance\nof 16 to 18% growth for revenue and 18 to 20% growth in EBITDA for 2024 in local currency terms.\nI would like to mention that we are very satisfied with our current trajectory of growth, given that we\nare beating actually more than planned the nominal GDP growth, which demonstrates solid wallet share\ngains in the countries that we operate in. With that, I would like to end our call and pass it to you and\nstart the Q&A session. Faisal.\nPage 6 of 8\nFaisal Ghori:\nThank you, Bob. We can now open up the line to Q&A.\nOperator:\nThank you.

Please unmute your audio, turn on your camera, and ask your question. As a reminder, we\nare allowing analysts one question and one related follow-up today. Written questions can be submitted\non the webcast by using the ask a question tab on the top right of your screen. We'll pause one moment\nto allow the queue to form. Our first question will come from Stella Cridge with Barclays. Please unmute\nyour audio and ask your question.\nStella Cridge:\nHi there everyone, many thanks for all the updates that you gave today. I wanted to ask about the base\ncase that you have for addressing the 2025 maturities. I mean, we obviously saw the whole co cash\nincreasing quarter on quarter. I was reading that you were expecting to receive the proceeds of the sale\nof TNS Plus within six weeks at the end of September, so I just wondered if that happened also, or would\nyou plan to still engage in some refinancing? That would be great, thanks.\nKaan Terzioğlu:\nStella, thank you very much for your question. We feel very comfortable about the servicing the 2025,\nand that will happen through our operational cash proceeds as well as you mentioned, the TNS plus sale.\nA portion of the sale proceeds has already been collected and the rest will happen over the next couple\nof weeks, so we do not see any issues with regard to that. Joop, anything that you would like to add?\nJoop Brakenhoff:\n[inaudible 00:34:54] Kaan, you're fully right based on the current upstream of cash and the close from\nthe TNS Plus, we'll be able to pay back the odds in April.\nStella Cridge:\nMany thanks for that. And if I could take the opportunity of this follow-up option for the question as\nwell. I mean, you're obviously speaking today from Dubai, you've communicated about the change in\nthe headquarters. I just wonder from a corporate structure point of view, does this have any other\nimplications than the structure? You obviously got beyond holding BV as issuing entity. Would you plan\nto issue from another entity in the future or do you think you would keep that as your bond-related\nentity?\nKaan Terzioğlu:\nStella, I think those decisions will happen over the time, but we will definitely explore alternatives to it\nas we will be paying back the old bonds and the new bonds will probably be issued from a new entity.\nStella Cridge:\nMany thanks for that.\nPage 7 of 8\nKaan Terzioğlu:\nThank you very much.\nFaisal Ghori:\nWe have a submitted question from a retail investor. Given Shaw Capital's roadmap to $160 share price\nor a 5.5 times EV EBITDA valuation by 2026, can you discuss the feasibility of achieving these targets and\nthe strategies you plan to implement to reach them? What are we doing to increase worth?\nKaan Terzioğlu:\nThank you very much and thanks a lot for raising this question. We have actually responded to the letter\nsent by Shaw Capital in a proper way, approved by our board, and first of all, we are delighted to have\ncommitted and excited shareholders in supporting our strategies. All the seven issues Shaw Capital has\nraised in their letter are actually part of our game plans and we are in the process of delivering on those.\nSo given that and given the, I think a reasonable 5.5 metric he has set for it, of course we will do\neverything in our control in terms of executing the strategy and achieving that value creation\nopportunity. Naturally, there are certain things which might be out of our control like the wars and\nrevolutions in different parts of the world, but so far our team, I believe, has proven to be very resilient\nwhen it comes to challenges of that nature and we will be executing our strategies as previously\nplanned. Thank you very much.\nOperator:\nWe'll take another submitted question from a retail investor. What is the amount of tax savings that\nVion is expecting in 2025 with the headquarters move to Dubai? Will there be any savings for 2024?\nKaan Terzioğlu:\nTo be precise, moving to Dubai has never been an issue about saving taxes. We do pay our taxes in the\ncountries that we operate, and there is no particular differentiation in between Netherlands and United\nArab Emirates nor Dubai in terms of taxation of enterprises. So we are not expecting any changes to our\neffective tax rate because of our move to Dubai. There are other areas where we have prioritized our\neffective tax rate as something that we have to improve. And if you would remember, this was also one\nof the seven points of the famous shot letter that we will of course take into consideration, most of\nthem related to our local operations. Thank you.\nOperator:\nWe have no further questions at this time. I will hand it back to Faisal Horry for closing remarks.\nFaisal Ghori:\nThank you everybody. Thank you for joining our quarter three earnings call. Myself and the IR team is\navailable for any additional questions that you may have, so feel free to reach out. Thank you\neverybody.\nPage 8 of 8"
