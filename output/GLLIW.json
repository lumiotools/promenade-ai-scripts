As of July 31, sales contracts had been\nconcluded for a total of 906 units (69.7%) of the plan for FY2024, and negotiations are underway for the remaining properties. Steady progress is being\nmade toward achieving the full-year earnings forecast.\n Regarding non-residential areas (land purchases and office buildings), procurement and value-enhancement initiatives are progressing smoothly\ncompared to internal plans.\n Upfront investment in the DX business will lead to expenses of about 100 million yen, which will affect consolidated ordinary income in the first half, but\nwe expect to recoup the investment in the full year. As a result, we anticipate this will not affect the achievement of full-year results.\n The total number of residential units purchased in the first half was 741 units (including 296 off-balance sheet purchases)\n*Includes 175 units from off-\nbalance sheet projects in progress.\nWe are building out our pipeline to accumulate sales in FY2025 and beyond.\n See page 31 for the direction of the new Medium-Term Management Plan, including initiatives for a combination of real estate, environment,\nand DX.\n6\n© Global Link Management Inc.

In addition to an ample pipeline in FY2024, new businesses will be launched earlier than\nexpected.Against this backdrop, net sales were revised upward from the previous Medium-Term Management Plan target of 50 to 60 billion yen. On the other hand, due to soaring construction costs,\netc., the profit margin is conservatively forecast, and the target for ordinary income remains unchanged at 5 billion yen.\n We have already exceeded our sales target of 1,240 units for whole building sales in FY2024. Sales contracts have been concluded for 690 units in the first half, and a cumulative total of 857 units as\nof July 31.\nNegotiations have also progressed for the remaining nine buildings and 438 units, and we are making steady progress toward achieving the plan.\n The target for the ratio of \"environmentally friendly buildings\" will not be achieved due to a delay in completion due to the 2024 problem.

On the other hand, the future outlook for the global\neconomy continues to remain uncertain due to rising raw material and energy prices, continued inflation, and\nthe impact of global financial tightening, so continuous attention is necessary.\nIn the real estate industry to which the Group belongs, while there are concerns such as rising construction\ncosts as a result of high global raw material prices and rising land prices due to a shortage of prime land,\ninvestment demand for Japanese real estate by Japanese and foreign investors remains strong against the\nbackdrop of Japan’s low-interest rates and depreciation of the yen.\nUnder these economic conditions, the Group has been working to develop its business by focusing on the\ndevelopment and sales of residential products, including condominiums. In the fiscal year under review, due\nto the promotion of bulk sales, or “Matomete Hanbai” of new apartment buildings as outlined in our growth\nstrategy, we have made progress in delivering high-added-value properties, selling a total of 1,079 units\nthrough both bulk sales of apartment buildings and sales of individual units. In the land purchasing business,\na new business in the non-residential area, we achieved land planning and sales for four properties. Business\nprogressed favorably as a result of improvements in gross profit due to our high-added-value approach,\ncurbing expenses through sales efficiency, and the achievement of new business plans ahead of schedule.\nAs for the progress of the three-year medium-term management plan announced in 2022, the number of\nproperties acquired, including environmentally friendly building properties with ZEH and BELS certifications,\nhas exceeded the plan, and steady progress has been made in our new land purchasing business in the non-\nresidential area and building business. In addition, we established a subsidiary engaged in IT-related business\nin the DX field and have started a business that is expected to contribute to earnings in the future. We are\nmaking steady progress towards achieving the targets of ¥50 billion in net sales and ¥5 billion in ordinary\nincome in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, the final year of our medium-term management plan.\nAs a result, the Company reported net sales of ¥41,258,887 thousand, operating income of ¥4,586,942\nthousand, ordinary income of ¥4,260,665 thousand, and profit attributable to owners of the parent of\n¥2,878,780 thousand for the fiscal year under review.\nBecause the real estate solutions business and property management business were aggregated into a single\nreporting segment in the fiscal year under review, segment information has been omitted.\n- 5 -\n(ii) Capital investment\nThere are no matters to report.\n(iii) Funding\nIn the fiscal year under review, the Company raised funds in total of ¥16,499,172 thousand, by borrowing and\nfunding ¥11,996,406 thousand from financial institutions, etc. to purchase properties and land for development,\nborrowing ¥4,302,766 thousand to pay taxes and use as working capital, and issued bonds as described below.\nCompany name Issue name Issue date Total issue amount Redemption date\nGlobal Link 3rd Unsecured\nOctober 20, 2023 ¥200,000 thousand October 20, 2026\nManagement Inc.

As of July 31, sales contracts had been\nconcluded for a total of 906 units (69.7%) of the plan for FY2024, and negotiations are underway for the remaining properties. Steady progress is being\nmade toward achieving the full-year earnings forecast.\n Regarding non-residential areas (land purchases and office buildings), procurement and value-enhancement initiatives are progressing smoothly\ncompared to internal plans.\n Upfront investment in the DX business will lead to expenses of about 100 million yen, which will affect consolidated ordinary income in the first half, but\nwe expect to recoup the investment in the full year. As a result, we anticipate this will not affect the achievement of full-year results.\n The total number of residential units purchased in the first half was 741 units (including 296 off-balance sheet purchases)\n*Includes 175 units from off-\nbalance sheet projects in progress.\nWe are building out our pipeline to accumulate sales in FY2025 and beyond.\n See page 31 for the direction of the new Medium-Term Management Plan, including initiatives for a combination of real estate, environment,\nand DX.\n6\n© Global Link Management Inc.

In addition to an ample pipeline in FY2024, new businesses will be launched earlier than\nexpected.Against this backdrop, net sales were revised upward from the previous Medium-Term Management Plan target of 50 to 60 billion yen. On the other hand, due to soaring construction costs,\netc., the profit margin is conservatively forecast, and the target for ordinary income remains unchanged at 5 billion yen.\n We have already exceeded our sales target of 1,240 units for whole building sales in FY2024.

In FY 12/2023, sales, ordinary income and the number of units sold hit a record high.\n Ordinary income margin significantly improved YoY from 6.4% to 10.3% through the promotion of bulk sale of apartment buildings, the improvement of added value via the sale of “eco-\nfriendly buildings,” and the contribution to profit by the new business Land Purchase Business.\n At the end of the third quarter, we increased the dividend per share by 47.5 yen from the initial plan (52.5 yen) to 100 yen, in accordance with our return policy.\n 1,776 (including 771 units of off-balance projects in progress) units were steadily purchased in FY 12/2023.\n Although posting was postponed due to the delay in construction, etc., we procured 1,242 units, which are enough to achieve the goal of selling 1,240 units of newly built condominiums in FY\n12/2024 as set in the mid-term management plan.\n We obtained the certification for “eco-friendly buildings” steadily, but the posting of some items was postponed due to the delay in construction, etc. caused by the expected problems in 2024, so\nthe forecast number of units of “eco-friendly buildings” in the mid-term management plan was revised downwardly.\n*1: Decrease from the figure in the third quarter of FY 12/2023 due to the postponement\nof posting (figure as of the end of Dec.)\n6\n© Global Link Management Inc.

In FY 12/2024, there are a sufficient number of pipelines and the launch of new businesses is earlier than\nassumed, so the forecast sales were revised upwardly from 50 billion yen in the mid-term management plan target to 60 billion yen. On the other hand, the forecast ordinary income remained 5 billion yen,\nbecause we conservatively project profit margin, while considering the skyrocketing of construction costs, etc.\n The number of procured units has already exceeded the target number of units sold (1,240) in FY 12/2024. Regarding the sale in FY 12/2024, business negotiations for concluding sales contracts are\nprogressing, and we plan to timely disclose information from the first quarter.\n The ratio of “eco-friendly buildings” is projected to fall below the target ratio due to the postponement of posting caused by the delay in construction due to the expected problems in 2024, but this will not prevent us\nfrom attaining the goals.\n8\n© Global Link Management Inc.

As of July 31, sales contracts had been\nconcluded for a total of 906 units (69.7%) of the plan for FY2024, and negotiations are underway for the remaining properties. Steady progress is being\nmade toward achieving the full-year earnings forecast.\n Regarding non-residential areas (land purchases and office buildings), procurement and value-enhancement initiatives are progressing smoothly\ncompared to internal plans.\n Upfront investment in the DX business will lead to expenses of about 100 million yen, which will affect consolidated ordinary income in the first half, but\nwe expect to recoup the investment in the full year. As a result, we anticipate this will not affect the achievement of full-year results.\n The total number of residential units purchased in the first half was 741 units (including 296 off-balance sheet purchases)\n*Includes 175 units from off-\nbalance sheet projects in progress.\nWe are building out our pipeline to accumulate sales in FY2025 and beyond.\n See page 31 for the direction of the new Medium-Term Management Plan, including initiatives for a combination of real estate, environment,\nand DX.\n6\n© Global Link Management Inc.

In addition to an ample pipeline in FY2024, new businesses will be launched earlier than\nexpected.Against this backdrop, net sales were revised upward from the previous Medium-Term Management Plan target of 50 to 60 billion yen. On the other hand, due to soaring construction costs,\netc., the profit margin is conservatively forecast, and the target for ordinary income remains unchanged at 5 billion yen.\n We have already exceeded our sales target of 1,240 units for whole building sales in FY2024.
