This stability ensures continued progress in identifying and replacing lead service lines nationwide.\n\nFurther, the Trump administration is expected to prioritize critical water infrastructure challenges, including drinking water safety and lead pipe remediation. It was the 2016 Trump administration that revitalized the 1991 Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) laying the groundwork for the Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR) that were finalized in 2021.\n\n“Americans deserve safe, reliable drinking water, and we’re proud that Crown’s Element 82 and PE Pipelines businesses are playing a key role in achieving that vision,” said Doug Croxall, CEO and Chairman, Crown. “The Trump administration has historically demonstrated a commitment to improving water infrastructure as seen with its 2016 efforts to modernize the LCR. With water safety remaining a national priority, we’re encouraged by the potential for increased attention and funding under the incoming administration. We believe that the opportunity for our innovative lead pipe identification and remediation solutions remains robust now and through the next presidential term.”\n\nIn order to support the strong demand for Crown’s innovative solutions, the Company continues to explore all funding options including reinstating its Equity Line of Credit (ELOC) to ensure access to all forms of capital sources.\n\n**About Crown** Crown (Nasdaq: CRKN) is an innovative infrastructure solutions provider dedicated to benefiting communities and the environment. Comprised of three business divisions, Smart Windows, Fiber Optics, and Water Solutions, Crown is developing and delivering cutting edge solutions that are challenging the status quo and redefining industry standards.

While the EPA now requires all lead drinking water pipes to be removed over a ten-year period, unidentified or unknown pipes must be treated the same as lead pipes and removed. As a result, water utilities have an incentive to identify unknown pipe materials, as non-lead,” concluded Mr. Kinsella.\n\nCalifornia-based [Electro Scan Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MbCtyBqNvxWPRyajXj-acUn-oANjQn2h0A0tVZwNJ_6pFCDc-M4QpKkMMO7fFR9XNMcsJ22BTC0aiifJQ0A6o8m6cHHacrbFXw805nF2KKw=) is the developer of the only commercially available machine-intelligent solution capable of automatically identifying buried copper, galvanized, plastic and lead pipe, without digging or excavation.\n\n“Crown has become our ‘go-to’ services partner in response to unprecedented demand from America’s 40,000+ water systems to reduce the number of unknown pipe materials,” says Chuck Hansen, CEO, Electro Scan Inc. “The ability for Crown to offer a ‘find & fix’ solution – combining Element 82 and PE Pipelines – makes for a compelling platform to ensure the future water quality for Americans.”\n\n**Webcast Information**\n\n**Event:** Electro Scan’s Lead Webinar**Date:** Tuesday, November 12, 2024**Time:** 11:00 a.m. ET / 8:00 a.m. PT**Registration:**[https://www.electroscan.com/lcri-swordfish-webinar-november-12-2024/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jeYTd8sMyeCiUBLYDlbQuW7j864t_OY2Oir00G69tavvIUVyoqCkN3-VHba1WNMpws4ZnU4aCqU3G3BxkFhWQdORFxijhcsDu-koAJWR9h1fiG0FpP5YwQmPXE-RAgZZTQ93k7_0WgbFMCysooPVRi6D7YEjlxVIUR-wHmlguznAHQU8K75gHH9jg1VP8uBVBW3-j_7Qjz8HPDEHxsfCtA==)\n\nFor more information about the event, please send an email to Crown Investor Relations at [info@crownek.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yfkRCIEzIk7MGqEBwBO3qVGmciCeMley1k_xb-flnMLFKGmLB6WbKUew8l6U2QntIzmvzGMnHp08J8tbEXYptQ==).\n\n**About Electro Scan Inc.** Electro Scan is an independent, impartial and innovative partner to utilities, municipal water and sewer agencies, and consulting engineering firms in the Testing, Inspection and Certification (TIC) market.
