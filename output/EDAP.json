The results from the study were presented on November 19th at the 187th Acoustical Society of America meeting, which is taking place virtually from November 18 - 22, 2024.\n\nHistotripsy is a non-ionizing, non-thermal and noninvasive technique for [tissue ablation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4OeekKKxP_1cQ_ElR6YiSBZivkqM607AWQoUQLN_6fy_3Ox3sMguh4B4IAXnisDPng4EbVCvzcMak_E2zmfhsJo5t5bfvX42HMwYrB79UlWL9UNoZ_1sbBDn1x-NDRCXyUpCrJY-C6nJmQSLH4WdsCzo1PRvhJPavGI-i8wWDyI=) that generates controlled acoustic microcavitation using microsecond ultrasound pulses leading to mechanical tissue destruction.1 Over the last several years, the technology has been increasingly evaluated for applications in cancer as well as benign conditions.\n\n“The results from this initial technical feasibility study demonstrate EDAP’s continued commitment in driving innovation in our core focused ultrasound energy delivery technology,” said Ryan Rhodes, Chief Executive Officer of EDAP TMS. “As focal therapy continues to evolve for the treatment of multiple conditions, histotripsy represents an expansion in energy-based therapies that we plan to further invest in and develop as part of our innovation roadmap. This technical milestone, in addition to our clinical development of real-time elastography to enable ablation treatment confirmation, demonstrates our commitment towards remaining the innovation leader in focal therapy.”\n\n**Presentation Details:**\n\n  * **Conference:** 187th Meeting of Acoustical Society of America\n  * **Oral Presentation:** November 19, 2024, 5:00 PM ET \n  * **Presentation Title** : “Feasibility Study of Histotripsy with the Clinical Device Focal One®”\n  * **Session** : 1pBA, Bubble-Based Therapies\n  * **Presenter** : Virgil Accary, M.S.\n\n\n\n1 Source: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/histotripsy](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1nT8pdkaFtEb31c1p3XkGxwshILXKl5Wy9Qn15zPCPfy5jP1pCEr-rxp44uVWzXevpS6WJKPMn8T59f6kbsHcWPoUtsYb1ygNWuQgMvRPaWpkskYwHcqMFeCU5zKvmOZuK9dYnDuIzMdIcu1yKnJxO1bS0ppVSJqj3bmqHx2rlxVsA2UnTjwJMvAnW2WZYdwIe0G7qbOS4WY5MCq7vaMj3XfmAFIXSGBwJ-GXFVGdlk=)\n\n**About EDAP TMS SA** A recognized leader in the global therapeutic ultrasound market, EDAP TMS develops, manufactures, promotes and distributes worldwide minimally invasive medical devices for various pathologies using ultrasound technology.

The presentation was entitled, \"Evaluation of rectal endometriosis treatment with high-intensity focused ultrasound versus surgery: a retrospective multicenter study\", and was delivered by Professor Gil Dubernard, Head of Gynecology Department at Croix-Rousse University Hospital, Lyon, France, and Principal Investigator.\n\n“The comparative results from these two cohorts demonstrate that, based on its much less invasive treatment approach, robotic HIFU therapy could offer meaningful advantages over surgical intervention both with respect to reducing post-procedure complications, duration of hospital stay and improving overall patient health,” said Professor Dubernard. “I look forward to seeing robotic HIFU technology continue to advance for the treatment of rectal endometriosis, which at present, has very few treatment alternatives other than highly invasive surgical procedures.” \n\nThe objective of the study was to compare the management of rectal endometriosis with HIFU and surgery in terms of treatment-related improvements in symptoms and morbidity. The trial was designed as a comparative, retrospective, multicenter study that reviewed treatment outcomes of 120 patients issued from 2 prospective databases. The first cohort comprised 60 consecutive patients from the ENDO-HIFU-R1 Phase 2 study who underwent a High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of the posterior deep infiltrating endometriosis at 4 different centers. The second cohort was comprised of 60 patients from a large surgical database who had complete surgical excision of their endometriosis lesions, including digestive involvement.\n\n**Highlighted Results**\n\n  * Compared to surgery, patients treated with HIFU therapy for the management of deep infiltrating rectal endometriosis nodules showed encouraging data with respect to health improvement, reduced rate of complications, shorter operating time, and reduction in length of hospital stay.\n  * Moderate and severe postoperative complications were significantly less frequent after HIFU treatment compared to surgery.\n  * These findings suggest that HIFU treatment could be an alternative to surgery in select patients with rectal endometriosis.\n\n\n\nAs previously reported, the Company’s ongoing Phase 3 trial evaluating Focal One HIFU for the treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis continues per protocol, with more than 85% of the patients initially in the Sham treatment arm having elected to receive HIFU therapy as their symptoms returned back to their high baseline levels. This additional data continues to suggest that HIFU therapy is a safe, non-invasive treatment that has significant potential to reduce pain for women suffering from this debilitating condition. Between now and year-end, the Company expects to communicate with the FDA to discuss this data and the next steps forward for this program.\n\n**About EDAP TMS SA** A recognized leader in the global therapeutic ultrasound market, EDAP TMS develops, manufactures, promotes and distributes worldwide minimally invasive medical devices for various pathologies using ultrasound technology.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the clinical status and market acceptance of our HIFU devices and the continued market potential for our lithotripsy and distribution divisions, as well as risks associated with the current worldwide inflationary environment, the uncertain worldwide economic, political and financial environment, geopolitical instability, climate change and pandemics like the COVID 19 pandemic, or other public health crises, and their related impact on our business operations, including their impacts across our businesses or demand for our devices and services.\n\nOther factors that may cause such a difference may also include, but are not limited to, those described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in particular, in the sections \"Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F.\n\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Other than required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update them in light of new information or future developments. These forward-looking statements are based upon information, assumptions and estimates available to us as of the date of this press release, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete.\n\n**Company Contact** Blandine ConfortInvestor Relations / Legal AffairsEDAP TMS SA+33 4 72 15 31 50bconfort@edap-tms.com\n\n**Investor Contact** John FrauncesLifeSci Advisors, LLC(917) 355-2395[jfraunces@lifesciadvisors.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uu2OtB_3jw1BhlEw15hJ_LSPATGAuCChMBuuFsp8IZpTTnRk2kNf0M5ldq0n_dqsIsmXTTkwHg1ev3sV8B0bUOh3LQ2ZXWutVw4FuNFkysJAMgNrYgaXFAyxS2iMeOI6)\n\n![](https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/media/ZTU5ZTcyZmYtYTc4Zi00ZjczLWJjZjItNTIzNDEyZTEyOTFlLTEwMzg1NTE=/tiny/EDAP-TMS-S-A-.png)\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.edap-tms.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fedap-announces-scientific-presentation-2024-aagl-global-congress&t=EDAP TMS S.A. - EDAP Announces Scientific Presentation at 2024 AAGL Global Congress Comparing Focal One HIFU Versus Surgery for the Treatment of Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis   \"Facebook\")\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.edap-tms.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fedap-announces-scientific-presentation-2024-aagl-global-congress&title=EDAP TMS S.A. - EDAP Announces Scientific Presentation at 2024 AAGL Global Congress Comparing Focal One HIFU Versus Surgery for the Treatment of Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis   \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=EDAP TMS S.A. - EDAP Announces Scientific Presentation at 2024 AAGL Global Congress Comparing Focal One HIFU Versus Surgery for the Treatment of Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis  +https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.edap-tms.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fedap-announces-scientific-presentation-2024-aagl-global-congress \"Twitter\")\n  * [](/rss-news-feeds \"RSS\")\n\n\n"
