This new seamless direct-to-consumer shopping experience allows consumers to order eligible health products and medications on the GoodRx platform and have them shipped directly to their door. Not only does this mark GoodRx’s entry into the over-the-counter (OTC) market, but it offers valuable partnership opportunities for consumer health and pharmaceutical brands looking to leverage GoodRx’s extensive reach and scale. \n\nThis press release features multimedia.

Now, consumers have another way of conveniently ordering Opill contraception directly to their doorsteps without the need for a doctor visit or prescription. This new GoodRx capability allows consumer health and pharmaceutical brands looking to provide a frictionless experience for consumers to integrate their offerings directly within the GoodRx platform. \n\n\"We are thrilled to launch our e-commerce solution with Opill, an initiative that underscores our mutual commitment to more accessible healthcare,\" stated Dorothy Gemmell, Chief Commercial Officer at GoodRx. \"This new feature will provide patients with a simple, seamless way to obtain their eligible medications, building on how GoodRx has already made prescription medications more affordable and accessible for millions of consumers. It also paves the way for other OTC brands and pharma partners to leverage our platform’s reach to expand market presence, increase consumer access to essential medications and ultimately help drive growth.\" \n\nThe GoodRx and Opill partnership addresses significant gaps in healthcare access, particularly for the [more than 19 million](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kff.org%2Freport-section%2Fcontraception-in-the-united-states-a-closer-look-at-experiences-preferences-and-coverage-findings%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DFor%2520most%2520people%252C%2520private%2520coverage%2Cto%2520a%2520health%2520center%2520offering&esheet=54145052&newsitemid=20241031197282&lan=en-US&anchor=more+than+19+million&index=4&md5=33143c27e1037aedccf03c073e2aa2e8) women living in areas with limited contraceptive services. By removing major obstacles such as high costs and logistical challenges, this initiative provides another avenue for direct access to OTC birth control, empowering women to take control of their reproductive health with ease and without a visit to a doctor. \n\n“Perrigo worked for years to bring a U.S. daily oral birth control option over the counter, providing a solution to those experiencing barriers like a lapse in insurance coverage and a historic lack of effective options available without a prescription,” said Sara Young, SVP and Chief Growth and Transformation Officer at Perrigo, the manufacturer of Opill. “Teaming up with GoodRx allows us to leverage its broad user base and easy-to-use platform to make it simple for women to directly order Opill, which is currently the most effective birth control option available without a prescription. This partnership makes accessing birth control more convenient for the millions of people who use GoodRx each year.” \n\nLeveraging deep insights into consumer health behavior, GoodRx’s new e-commerce experience aligns with the surge in consumer demand for more autonomy over healthcare management, a trend accelerated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. By addressing traditional healthcare hurdles, GoodRx is empowering consumers to manage their healthcare more effectively and independently, and enabling partners to improve visibility and accessibility for their medications. \n\nFor Important Safety Information, please see [Opill.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fopill.com&esheet=54145052&newsitemid=20241031197282&lan=en-US&anchor=Opill.com&index=5&md5=14ba2cfab667e1efb02ba766da3922e2) and full [Patient Information](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.shopify.com%2Fs%2Ffiles%2F1%2F0719%2F3211%2F7296%2Ffiles%2FOpill-CIL.pdf&esheet=54145052&newsitemid=20241031197282&lan=en-US&anchor=Patient+Information&index=6&md5=8fd33c390b858d0c08952cc0e950ef15)\n\n**About GoodRx**\n\nGoodRx is the leading prescription savings platform in the U.S. Trusted by more than 25 million consumers and 750,000 healthcare professionals annually, GoodRx provides access to savings and affordability options for generic and brand-name medications at more than 70,000 pharmacies nationwide, as well as comprehensive healthcare research and information.

This initiative not only propels GoodRx’s momentum in weight loss solutions, but also broadens its portfolio in offering significant savings on brand-name medications, making obesity treatment more accessible and affordable for millions. \n\nAccording to the [CDC](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fobesity%2Fadult-obesity-facts%2Findex.html&esheet=54143530&newsitemid=20241029836195&lan=en-US&anchor=CDC&index=3&md5=61590ff0944e0fad3204210bd80a3de4), more than two in five U.S. adults have obesity, and untreated obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and mortality. While demand for weight-loss medications [has soared](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pewresearch.org%2Fshort-reads%2F2024%2F03%2F21%2Fas-obesity-rates-rise-in-the-us-and-worldwide-new-weight-loss-drugs-surge-in-popularity%2F&esheet=54143530&newsitemid=20241029836195&lan=en-US&anchor=has+soared&index=4&md5=6cb46a03493f1d5735fb2a0a05bbe0dd) in recent years, consumers often struggle to access them due to high costs and lack of insurance coverage. By making QSYMIA more accessible, GoodRx and Vivus are helping those struggling with weight and obesity find more affordable ways to access the treatments they need. \n\nNow, anyone with a valid prescription, regardless of insurance status, can use GoodRx to purchase a 30-day supply of QSYMIA at the exclusive cash price of $149. QSYMIA is designed to help patients manage hunger and reduce cravings throughout the day and, combined with a healthy diet and exercise, has been proven to help patients lose and maintain weight. Many individuals prefer oral medications over injectables, and the simplicity of taking a daily pill can make it easier to adhere to treatment regimens. \n\n“Obesity medications are life-changing for millions of Americans, but accessibility and affordability are often a barrier for many consumers,” said Dorothy Gemmell, Chief Commercial Officer at GoodRx. “Through this partnership, we’re making headway in getting these critical medications into the hands of those who need them and improving access to a medication that not only helps with weight loss, but is also tied to better outcomes for other costly chronic diseases.” \n\n“We are dedicated to expanding access to our critical medications that consumers rely on,” said John Amos, CEO at VIVUS. “Collaborating with GoodRx enables us to offer an affordable solution for individuals who have prescriptions for QSYMIA and expand access to those seeking a cost-effective option to fill them. One in five adults and one in four young adults (12-17) experience weight loss on the top dose of QSYMIA of at least 20% of their body weight. Our partnership with GoodRx coupled with the weight loss profile of QSYMIA offers Americans an unprecedented value vs. other therapies.” \n\nGoodRx works with nearly 150 brands across pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical device companies and OTC medicines to surface their savings and patient support programs directly with high-intent audiences via the GoodRx platform. The company recently announced a partnership with Pfizer to offer its menopause hormone therapies at low prices in retail pharmacies exclusively via GoodRx. Similarly, the company launched an affordability program with ARS Pharmaceuticals to offer [_neffy_](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodrx.com%2Fneffy&esheet=54143530&newsitemid=20241029836195&lan=en-US&anchor=neffy&index=5&md5=216401dadcd58f257b78029962230351) at an exclusive low discounted cash price in retail pharmacies across the U.S.\n\n**About GoodRx**\n\nGoodRx is the leading prescription savings platform in the U.S. Trusted by more than 25 million consumers and 750,000 healthcare professionals annually, GoodRx provides access to savings and affordability options for generic and brand-name medications at more than 70,000 pharmacies nationwide, as well as comprehensive healthcare research and information.
