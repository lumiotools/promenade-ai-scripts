This integration brings authID’s best-in-class Proof and Verified products to Zendesk’s full suite of customer support solutions, to increase account security and reduce fraud, while providing great service for Zendesk users wherever they may be.\n\nAs more businesses take a digital-first approach, contact centers are now essential for timely customer service. At the same time, contact centers are a prime target for account takeover (ATO) fraud which resulted in nearly $13 billion in losses in 2023 ([2024 AARP & Javelin Fraud Study](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VlKRd08jUz613lkuMdJzvv_XzQN74sTITHJtXs0WEcfdzX6oWe264wdKCNi0vOc_os0iLU-yn7E8U6wsLJSI1r_WZLSnkWMKKSudPOgTvf1gwRM8C5RxU1DD_Bf3EpdRw_-aRZE0OIn_6qfeP8zLyoslMzDIKV76kobtah-bS9818n0A4NopeokCjunNa1Af)). To combat ATO attempts at the call center, today’s businesses need a way to deterministically validate a customer’s identity while still providing a smooth customer experience. authID has worked with Zendesk to combine its highly accurate and fast identity verification and authentication solutions with Zendesk’s contact center solution to reduce ATO fraud while maintaining a human connection.\n\nBenefits of the authID integration with Zendesk include:\n\n  * **Increased Account Security:** Eliminates reliance on outdated security questions or PINs, which are vulnerable to social engineering and can frustrate customers.\n  * **Accelerated Authentication:** Fast, secure, customer identity verification in less than a second.\n  * **Improved User Experience:** Simple selfie verification removes the need for a one-time passcode (OTP) or additional authenticator apps and provides a seamless login.\n  * **Data Privacy Compliance** : authID is compliant with regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, BIPA, and more.\n  * **Easy Integration:** authID seamlessly integrates with Zendesk out of the box (OOTB) to boost operational efficiency.\n\n\n\n“Our integration with authID, available through the Zendesk Marketplace, enables customer support solutions that focus on improving contact center efficiencies and delivering superior, secure experiences to their customers and employees,” said Tim Marsden, Senior Director, Technology Alliances at Zendesk. “With this enhancement to customer workflows, live agents are better equipped to deterministically verify and authenticate that the user is who they claim to be. Together, we’re making it possible in the age of deepfakes and injection attacks to stop fraud at the contact center while providing a great customer experience.”\n\n“Digital identity verification at the contact center requires organizations to maintain a delicate balance between managing fraud risk and reducing customer friction,” said Rhon Daguro, CEO of authID. “Over 100,000 brands with hundreds of millions of customers rely on Zendesk, and our integration with their solutions enables those brands to stop fraud and drive revenue growth in a fast, highly accurate, and data privacy-compliant way.”\n\nFind additional details on adding authID into your Zendesk environment [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5s_z8Dim_A1u5tqQsgprmqOpg6eCgUC6i12wNjZiIRWwsRcLYWRs-rHd0P221LO70pzc1ede9xGB0sO_cufT_-Ehou9tTh9p-dVinDDzgvXfDd0jHKEyeDsabrkhZa1G).\n\n**About authID**\n\nauthID® (Nasdaq: AUID) ensures enterprises “Know Who’s Behind the Device™” for every customer or employee login and transaction through its easy-to-integrate, patented, biometric identity platform. authID quickly and accurately verifies a user’s identity and eliminates any assumption of ‘who’ is behind a device to prevent cybercriminals from compromising account openings or taking over accounts.

As we move into the fourth quarter, we have already seen strong momentum through our signing of a $10 million multi-year contract. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.”_\n\n**Recent Business and Operational Highlights**\n\n  * On November 4, 2024, the Company announced a $10 million, multi-year agreement with a next-generation AI company, specializing in custom solutions for global multi-national companies, to enable biometric authentication for a range of industries in India.\n  * authID signed a $1 million plus, multi-year agreement with a global, digital engagement technology organization which will leverage our biometric identity solutions to enhance digital experiences for multinational retailers and also serve as an OEM reseller for authID in the Asia-Pacific market.\n  * On October 23, 2024, the Company announced the launch of its Biometric Identity Services with [Imperial Technologies](https://imperialinternet.com/), a broadband and wireless high-speed internet provider across all 50 states, which expands its market presence into the telecommunications vertical. This multi-year agreement will provide authID’s biometric identity and document verification services to streamline and secure new customer onboarding.\n  * In the third quarter, the Company took four new customers into Production Go-Live* for the second consecutive quarter. In particular, two deals signed in the third quarter went into Production Go-Live in the same quarter, representing a significant improvement over average implementation times, which can take three to six months.\n  * On September 24, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of industry veteran Erick Soto as Chief Product Officer. Soto, a seasoned leader with over 15 years in identity verification and FinTech, will enhance the Company’s biometric onboarding and authentication solutions, leveraging his experience from roles at BBVA, Oxygen Health and Socure to drive innovation in the Company’s product offerings.\n\n\n\n_* Production Go-Live means revenue generating use of our services._\n\n**Financial Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nTotal revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.25 million compared to $0.04 million for the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue was $0.69 million compared to $0.12 million in the comparable period of 2023.\n\nOperating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $3.8 million, flat compared to a year ago. For the nine-month period in 2024, operating expenses were $10.7 million compared with $7.6 million for the comparable period in 2023. The 2024 increase is primarily due to a one-time, non-cash expense reversal in Q1 2024 of $3.4 million of certain stock-based compensation related to employee terminations, which was not repeated in 2024.\n\nLoss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.4 million, of which non-cash charges were $0.6 million, compared with a loss of $3.7 million, of which non-cash charges were $1.6 million for the comparable period in 2023. For the nine-month period in 2024, the loss was $9.7 million, including $2.2 million in non-cash and one-time severance charges. This compares to a loss of $16.4 million for the comparable period in 2023, which included $10.4 million in non-cash and one-time severance charges, with approximately $7.5 million related to the exchange of convertible notes for common stock.\n\nLoss per share from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 improved to $0.31 compared with a loss per share of $0.47 for the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss per share improved to $0.97, compared with a loss per share of $3.05 for the comparable period in 2023.\n\nRemaining Performance Obligation (“RPO”) as of September 30, 2024, was $3.8 million, of which $0.3 million is held as deferred revenue and $3.5 million is related to other non-cancellable contracted amounts, compared to RPO of $1.9 million as of September 30, 2023. The Company expects approximately 27% of the RPO to be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months ending September 30, 2025, based on contractual commitments and expected usage patterns.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was $2.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with $2.1 million for the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA loss was $7.8 million compared with $6.0 million for the comparable period in 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss is primarily due to the re-investment in employees and contractors following the Q1 2023 restructuring. Please refer to Table 1 for reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure).\n\nThe gross amount of Booked Annual Recurring Revenue or bARR, as defined below, signed in the third quarter of 2024 was $1.15 million, up from $1.02 million of gross bARR a year ago. The net amount of bARR was $0.0 million compared to $1.0 million of net bARR signed in the comparable period in 2023. The Q3 bARR is comprised of $0.61 million in Committed Annual Recurring Revenue (cARR) and $0.54 million in estimated Usage Above Commitments (UAC). The gross amount of bARR signed in the third quarter of 2024 increased $0.5 million over the bARR signed in the second quarter of 2024. The net amount of bARR reflects the deduction of the bARR of contracts previously included in reported bARR, due to certain customers experiencing delays in Production Go-Live timing and volume ramping.\n\n**Revised Revenue Guidance for 2024**\n\nBased on the Company’s year-to-date results and expectations for the remainder of 2024, the Company is revising its 2024 outlook. While the Company experienced customer ramp and usage growth in the third quarter 2024, due to certain customers experiencing delays in Production Go-Live timing and volume ramping, the Company now expects revenue for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, to be in the range of $0.8 million to $0.9 million.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nA conference call and webcast will be held today at 5.00 p.m. EST, hosted by authID Chief Executive Officer Rhon Daguro and Chief Financial Officer Ed Sellitto to discuss the financial results and provide a corporate update.

Such forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions regarding authID’s present and future business strategies, and the environment in which authID expects to operate in the future, which assumptions may or may not be fulfilled in practice. Actual results may vary materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of risk factors, including the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers; successful implementation of the services to be provided under new customer contracts and their adoption by customers’ users; the Company’s ability to compete effectively; changes in laws, regulations and practices; changes in domestic and international economic and political conditions, the as yet uncertain impact of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, inflationary pressures, changes in interest rates, and others.

These forward-looking statements speak only as to the date of this release and cannot be relied upon as a guide to future performance. authID expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this release to reflect any changes in its expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any statement is based.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nThe Company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures in this statement. These non-GAAP key business indicators, which include Adjusted EBITDA, bARR and ARR should not be considered replacements for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.\n\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our company and our management.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude: (1) interest expense and debt discount and debt issuance costs amortization expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) stock-based compensation expense (stock options) and (6) loss on debt extinguishment, and conversion expense on exchange of Convertible Notes and certain other items management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Please see Table 1 below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA – continuing operations to net loss – continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**TABLE 1**\n\n**Reconciliation of Loss from Continuing Operations to Adjusted EBITDA Continuing Operations.**\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nLoss from continuing operations| $| (3,364,801| )| $| (3,715,703| )| $| (9,683,619| )| $| (16,397,649| )  \nAddback:  \nInterest expense, net| 12,712| 13,138| 36,219| 1,095,320  \nOther income| (161,308| )| (29,511| )| (344,185| )| (30,671| )  \nLoss on debt extinguishment| -| -| -| 380,741  \nConversion expense| -| -| -| 7,476,000  \nSeverance cost| -| 49,390| 14,251| 878,348  \nDepreciation and amortization| 43,798| 60,416| 131,210| 212,450  \nNon-cash recruiting fees| -| -| -| 438,000  \nTaxes| -| -| -| 3,255  \nStock compensation| 595,536| 1,519,952| 2,044,210| (22,949| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA continuing operations (Non-GAAP)| $| (2,874,063| )| (2,102,318| )| (7,801,914| )| (5,967,155| )  \n  \nManagement believes that bARR and ARR, when viewed with our results under GAAP, provide useful information about the direction of future growth trends of the Company’s revenues. We also rely on bARR as one of a number of primary measures to review and assess the sales performance of our Company and our management team in connection with our executive compensation. The Company defines Booked Annual Recurring Revenue or bARR, as the amount of annual recurring revenue represented by the estimated amounts of annual recurring revenue we believe will be earned under such contracted orders, looking out eighteen months from the date of signing of each customer contract. This estimate is comprised of two components (1) Committed Annual Recurring Revenue (cARR), which represents the minimum amounts that customers are contractually committed to pay each year over the life of the contract and (2) Usage Above Commitments (UAC), which represents our estimate of the rate of annual recurring revenue arising from actual usage of our services above the contractual minimums, that we believe the Customer will achieve after 18 months. The net amount of bARR reflects the deduction of the bARR of contracts previously included in reported bARR, which were subject to attrition, or other downward adjustments during the quarter. The gross amount of bARR signed in the third quarter of 2024 was $1.15 million and net amount of bARR was $0.0 million compared to $1.02 million of gross bARR and $1.0 million of net bARR signed in the third quarter of 2023. The Q3 bARR is comprised of $0.61 million in Committed Annual Recurring Revenue (cARR) and $0.54 million in estimated Usage Above Commitments (UAC).\n\nThe company defines Annual Recurring Revenue or ARR, as the amount of recurring revenue recognized during the last three months of the relevant period as determined in accordance with GAAP, multiplied by four. The amount of ARR as of September 30, 2024 increased to $1.0 million, as compared to $0.2 million of ARR as of September 30, 2023.\n\nbARR may be distinguished from ARR, as bARR does not take specifically into account the time to implement any contract for authID’s services, nor for any ramp in adoption, or seasonality of usage of our biometric products but is based on the assumption that 18 months after signing these matters will have been generally resolved. Furthermore, bARR is based on estimates of future revenues under particular contracts, whereas ARR, whilst also forward looking, is based on historical revenues recognized in accordance with GAAP during the relevant period. bARR and ARR have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * bARR & ARR should not be considered as predictors of future revenues but only as indicators of the direction in which revenues may be trending. Actual revenue results in the future as determined in accordance with GAAP may be significantly different to the amounts indicated as bARR or ARR at any time.\n  * bARR and ARR are to be considered “forward looking statements” and subject to the same risks, as other such statements (see note on “Forward Looking Statements” above).\n  * bARR & ARR only include revenues from sale of our biometric products and not other revenues.\n  * bARR & ARR do not include amounts we consider as non-recurring revenues (for example one-off implementation fees).\n\n\n\n**authID INC.

As CEO, you’re representing your firm at the conference, looking to make an impact and generate new business leads. Your phone alerts you to an e-mail from the organisers inviting you backstage for an opportunity to meet some of the stars visiting the conference. All looks legit. You confirm your attendance and think nothing more of it. When’s lunch?\n\nHowever, it turns out this email was a targeted phishing attack, aimed at C-level execs and sent out by identity authentication firm authID.\n\nOut of 436 opens, 210 recipients – 48% – clicked the simulated phishing link embedded in the email. Recipients included CCOs, CTOs, CISOs, CIOs, and heads of fraud and risk for the largest banks in the US.\n\n### The human factor\n\nAuthID provides secure identity authentication through its Human Factor Authentication (HFA) platform Verified, which combines FIDO2 passwordless device authentication with cloud biometrics to “authenticate the human behind the device”.\n\n![authID CEO Tom Thimot](https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2023/01/1605540683288.jpg)\n\nAuthID CEO Tom Thimot\n\n“Powered by sophisticated biometric and artificial intelligence technologies, our technology eliminates passwords to fortify enterprise security and trust between organisations, employees, and customers,” authID CEO Tom Thimot tells _FinTech Futures_.\n\nAuthID leverages the “human factor” and facial recognition technology to remediate today’s social engineering attacks. “If the human element is the problem in 82% of breaches, then solving for the human element — with cloud biometrics — is the ideal solution,” Thimot adds.\n\nThe firm operates across the financial services, healthcare, and cybersecurity markets, as it believes these sectors are more comfortable and familiar with passwordless authentication and are the industry segments that can benefit the most from HFA.\n\n“With highly valued assets and data, these segments are frequently targeted by social engineering and account compromise attacks that can cause significant damage to reputation, positioning, and market trust,” Thimot says.\n\n### Gone phishin’\n\nThe main weapon in a cybercriminal’s arsenal is the use of phishing – links that lead to a webpage that impersonates a brand, enticing you to click on them by saying your account is locked, suggesting your payment information is out of date or missing, or that you need to log in to retrieve a message or important document.\n\n![](https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2023/01/authid_phishing_email-1.jpg)\n\nAuthID’s Money20/20 USA phishing email\n\n“The purpose is to get a victim to hand over sensitive information or download malware,” Thimot explains. Attacks rely on deception and a sense of urgency, with misspelled URLS, site redirects, and unknown or suspicious message sources acting as major red flags.\n\nPhishing can take the form of general, mass-market emails which are sent to millions of potential victims to try to trick them into logging in to fake versions of popular websites. SMS messages can also be utilised in a similar fashion.\n\nSpear phishing comprises more targeted attacks focused on a specific individual, while ‘whaling’ attacks are aimed at the biggest fish — CEOs or other high-value targets like company board members.\n\nOthers may fall prey to business email compromise (BEC), in which attackers pretend to be a company CEO or other top executive, typically to get other individuals in that organisation to transfer money.\n\n### 0000\n\nPasswords, as a form of cybersecurity, have been around for 60 years and their application is fraught with issues. They are ripe for disruption, and Thimot believes we are “in the midst of a fundamental evolution in the science of authentication”, backed by a concerted effort to replace “frustrating and insecure” credentials with cryptographic FIDO2 passkeys, or a [FIDO token bound to a device](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2022/11/with-tech-giants-going-passwordless-will-banks-be-ready-to-meet-new-consumer-expectations/).\n\n“Social engineering attacks exploiting multi-factor authentication (MFA) technology have been successful in compromising major enterprises this year, including Twilio, Cisco, and Intuit,” Thimot says.\n\nOut of 4,110 breaches studied in the 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), compromised credentials due to insider error were the root cause of 82% breaches. On top of this, 84% of financial institutions also experienced account takeovers in the past year.\n\n“Legacy MFA places assumed trust in the recipient of a code, knowledge of the user, or holder of a device, making these methods easily phished and vulnerable to bad actors as they do not really authenticate the user behind the device,” Thimot explains.\n\nBecause most device-based authenticators do not require “live” biometrics for user identity and access authentication, they are highly susceptible to a variety of fraudulent activities which can provide bad actors with unauthorised access to enterprise systems — “often with catastrophic consequences”.\n\nIncredibly, Thimot says that most legacy MFA tech doesn’t meet the current minimum standards promulgated by the US government for zero trust architecture. The US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) noted that agencies must use strong MFA that is enforced at the application layer, not just the network layer, and that phishing-resistant MFA is required for agencies and their partners.\n\n### Biometrics and deepfakes\n\nAuthID views biometrics as the future of cybersecurity. “Biometrics eliminate any identity assumptions, validate the identity of the user, and verify the true account owner whenever increased assurance is needed,” Thimot explains.\n\n![](https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2023/01/2G90M7P-1.jpg)\n\nBiometrics are key to a passwordless future\n\nThe firm focuses its solutions on facial biometrics thanks to the worldwide adoption of mobile devices and the advancements of desktop computers with cameras. Facial biometrics can be easily performed and analysed with a simple act of a user taking a selfie on any device, at any time.\n\nBut does the use of facial biometrics open up the possibility that bad actors will exploit deepfake tech to crack cybersecurity in the future?\n\nPresentation attacks occur when fraudsters attempt to attack a biometric system by creating spoofs or fakes that are then presented to the biometric sensors. Such spoofs or deepfakes can use a printed photo, an image or video of a person on a tablet, 3D masks, models, or other forms of impersonation.\n\nThimot says the firm’s Verified platform leverages AI and Presentation Attack Detection technology to detect these attacks through passive liveness challenges on the user’s facial image.\n\nVerified’s passive liveness process captures images from a user’s mobile phone camera or desktop webcam and analyses them against several quality metrics. These frames are then sent through a pipeline of multiple presentation attack detection algorithms to detect spoofing attempts. The aggregate scores of these processes are returned by the system to indicate whether a biometric sample is authentic and should be considered for facial verification.\n\n“In the future, we will move toward being multi-modal with authentication – that is, using multiple biometrics combined with other factors,” Thimot says, with biometrics set to be used more and more for in-person transactions, for everything from in-store transactions to gaining access to a restricted building.\n\nAuthID intends to bring biometrics to common workflows that are plagued with identity challenges, such as account recovery, re-authentication during high-risk transactions, and authentication for shared devices.\n\n“Shared mobile devices are one of the hottest growing markets, but organisations are running into adoption issues due to poor login experiences on these devices. We are helping to bolster adoption through our portable authentication workflows.”\n\n### Protect yourself\n\nIf the top minds of our industry can fall victim to a phishing attack, what hope do the rest of us have?\n\nIn a world where multi-tasking is the norm, Thimot says, anyone can be caught off guard. So, what can you do to avoid being phished? It’s important to stay diligent and review things carefully before you hand over any personal information.\n\nSlowing down, carefully reading the email or text, and identifying warning signs may prevent a successful attack. Learn common phishing techniques and obvious indicators of a phishing attempt.\n\nBeing aware of red flags – for instance, grammar or spelling errors, a sense of urgency, requests for personal information, or inconsistent email addresses – can help you spot them in real life.\n\nCheck link destinations and verify the sender before clicking on any link. Hovering over or long pressing a link will reveal the true destination.\n\nLastly, make contact with the sender to validate that the email or text is legitimate. Be sure to use known contact information, such as the business phone number from their website.\n\nTags: [Biometrics, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/category/biometrics/) [Artificial Intelligence/AI, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/category/artificial-intelligenceai/) [Banking, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/category/banking/) [Data & Analytics, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/category/data-analytics/) [Events, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/category/events/) [Financial Crime & Fraud, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/category/financial-crime-fraud/) [Financial Services/Finserv, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/category/financial-servicesfinserv/) [Innovation, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/category/innovation/) [Mobile](https://www.fintechfutures.com/category/mobile/) [authID, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/tag/authid/) [Tom Thimot](https://www.fintechfutures.com/tag/tom-thimot/) [FinTech](https://www.fintechfutures.com/subject/fintech/) [Features, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/type/features/) [Analysis, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/type/analysis/) [Interviews](https://www.fintechfutures.com/type/interviews/) [USA, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/region/usa/) [North America, ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/region/north-america/) [Worldwide](https://www.fintechfutures.com/region/worldwide/)\n\n### READ NEXT\n\n  * [ ![Top five fintech news](https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2022/07/topfive-110x110.jpg) FinTech Futures: Top five news stories of the week – 29 November 2024 ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2024/11/fintech-futures-top-five-news-stories-of-the-week-29-november-2024/ \"FinTech Futures: Top five news stories of the week – 29 November 2024\")\n  * [ ![ICYMI - Fintech news funding](https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2022/02/2FKYJY8-110x110.jpg) ICYMI fintech funding round-up: Habitto, Norbr, Tembo, and more ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2024/11/icymi-fintech-funding-round-up-habitto-norbr-tembo-and-more/ \"ICYMI fintech funding round-up: Habitto, Norbr, Tembo, and more\")\n  * [ ![acquisition M&A - fintech news](https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2021/04/AdobeStock_172180231-110x110.jpeg) November 2024: Top five fintech M&A deals of the month ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2024/11/november-2024-top-five-fintech-ma-deals-of-the-month/ \"November 2024: Top five fintech M&A deals of the month\")\n  * [ ![Lightyear - FinTech News](https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2024/11/Lightyear-FinTech-News-110x110.png) Lightyear secures direct FCA authorisation, set to relaunch in the UK ](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2024/11/lightyear-secures-direct-fca-authorisation-set-to-relaunch-in-the-uk/ \"Lightyear secures direct FCA authorisation, set to relaunch in the UK\")\n\n\n\n### Leave a comment [Cancel reply](/2023/01/dont-click-this-link-how-authid-aims-to-protect-you-from-yourself/#respond)\n\n-or-\n\n[Log in with your FinTech Futures: Fintech news account](https://www.fintechfutures.com/log-in/?redirect=https://www.fintechfutures.com/2023/01/dont-click-this-link-how-authid-aims-to-protect-you-from-yourself/)\n\nAlternatively, post a comment by completing the form below:\n\nYour email address will not be published.

What are the three core components of zero trust?**\n\nZero trust is more than just the buzzword of the moment in cybersecurity. With social engineering attacks exploiting compromised passwords and legacy multi-factor authentication (MFA) technology successfully compromising many large enterprises, the need for zero trust is clearer than ever.\n\n### What is zero trust?\n\nZero trust means set of principles that govern how cyber professionals design and implement systems as well as authentication of user access and privileges to those systems, and how we all think about security.\n\n### By order of the President\n\nThe conversation around zero trust is accelerating, as new cybersecurity paradigms are being defined and adopted at the highest levels of government. In 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order calling on the US government to institute “bold changes and significant investments” in security measures to better protect federal networks from attack. The White House Office of Management and Budget followed by defining a “zero trust strategy”, outlining the security architecture which would fulfil the executive order to overhaul federal cybersecurity practices.\n\nThe US government mandated that authentication now includes two components: device authentication and identity authentication.\n\n“When authorizing users to access resources, agencies must consider at least one device-level signal alongside identity information about the authenticated user,” according to the [OMB](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/).\n\nIt is important to recognise that this requirement drives a new paradigm for security professionals. It emphasises that password-less solutions on their own are not enough to achieve zero trust, and that identity authentication must go hand-in-hand. Given these mandates, zero trust is likely to prompt major shifts in how all organisations structure networks and authenticate their workforce, third-party vendors and customers.\n\nAll of this establishes zero trust’s importance. But just what _is_ it, exactly?\n\n### Zero trust definitions\n\nAccording to the National Institute for Standards and Technology ([NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)), “zero trust is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defences from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources.”\n\nAll traffic is hostile and allows no implicit trust to be granted to assets or users.\n\nAlso, according to NIST: “Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource.”\n\nTo sum up zero trust in a nutshell, it:\n\n  * Requires that both users and devices be authenticated _before_ connecting to or accessing an enterprise resource to protect the resource from unauthorised access\n  * Does not assume that everything that has access to an environment should have access to everything within that environment as legacy network environments often do\n  * Focuses on individual and small groups of resources and granular control of access to them vs. the defence of a wide network perimeter\n\n\n\nZero trust contrasts what Forrester Consulting noted was an old saying in information security, “We want our network to be like an M&M, with a hard crunchy outside and a soft chewy center.”\n\nIn the past, security teams focused on protecting the “perimeter”— protecting access to trusted enterprise networks by implementing access controls like CASBs and VPN. With this methodology, however, security holes and authentication vulnerabilities leveraging passwords and transient trust still arise. A zero-trust approach centralises access mechanisms and grants access based on the risk and trustworthiness of both the user and the device, resulting in a more secure and resilient environment.\n\nWith zero trust, there is no more “chewy center” where users can move around freely, and device-based authentication by itself is not enough.\n\n### Components of zero trust\n\nForrester Consulting first coined the term in 2009, and released [seven operational domains of zero trust architecture.](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/ombs-zero-trust-strategy-government-gets-good/)\n\nSince Forrester’s seven pillars, NIST has established that zero trust architecture includes the following core components:\n\n  * The Policy Enforcement Point is the gateway to secure access for corporate resources, and is responsible for enabling, monitoring, and terminating connections between users, devices, and enterprise data\n  * The Policy Engine decides whether to grant access to organizational resources based on policies set by the organization’s security team\n  * The Policy Administrator is responsible for executing the access decisions made by the policy engine; this component allows or denies communication between a user and a protected resource\n\n\n\n### Why is zero trust important for organisations?\n\nZero trust was developed as a response to the new realities of our digital world. Enterprises must grapple with the challenge of authenticating employees in today’s hybrid/remote economy. Gartner predicts that an estimated 51 per cent of knowledge workers were remote by the end of 2021 and a Microsoft study found that 67 per cent of employees bring their own device.\n\nZero trust accommodates these modern network realities, including remote users, BYOD, and cloud-based assets which are not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary.\n\n### Insider threat\n\nA perimeter-focused security approach does little to combat insider threats, which are one of the most serious sources of breaches today.\n\nInsider threat incidents increased 47 per cent between 2018 and 2020, according to the Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report. According to the [Ponemon Institute](https://www.ponemon.org/), in 2020 the global average cost of an insider threat was $11.45m, while the average cost of a data breach over the same period was $3.86m.\n\nSocial engineering attacks exploiting legacy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) technology have been [successful in compromising Twilio, Cisco, Intuit, and other enterprises this year](https://authid.ai/blog/addressing-the-human-element-of-security-breaches). Out of 4,110 breaches studied in the 2022 Verizon DBIR, compromised credentials due to insider error was the root cause of 82 per cent of breaches.\n\n### The role of strong authentication\n\nSince a zero-trust model assumes a network is always at risk of being exposed to threats and requires all users and all devices be authenticated and authorised, authentication plays a huge role in a zero-trust ecosystem. Zero Trust Architecture is centred around identity and data, as the goal of implementation is to protect access to data by specific, authorised identities dynamically. The authentication of both users and devices is core to zero trust architecture as their verification prevents unauthorised access to networks, applications, and databases.\n\nImplementing zero trust architecture necessarily relies on implementing multiple points of authentication and requires asking users to authenticate themselves in various ways, over and over. Without strong authentication protocols in place to confirm the identity of the user and the device requesting access, security teams cannot obstruct unauthorised access to resources.\n\n### MFA’s role in authentication\n\nBecause MFA touches on so many elements of zero trust – MFA is used to authenticate access to an environment or privileges within an environment, or as an account recovery method when a potential threat actor is on a network – insufficient MFA can derail even the best laid plans for zero trust architecture.\n\nMultifactor authentication methods have become ubiquitous and have increased security. But most MFA being implemented is based on a couple of factors:\n\n  * Something you know (knowledge factor), such as passwords, PINs, and answers to personal security questions, or\n  * Something you have (possession factor), such as mobile devices, physical tokens, key fobs, and smartcards\n\n\n\nLegacy MFA places assumed trust in the recipient of a code, knowledge of the user, or holder of a device. These types of MFA therefore can be vulnerable and easy to spoof as they do not really authenticate the user behind the device. Most device-based authenticators do not require “live” biometrics for user identity and access authentication.\n\nIn addition, legacy MFA can present administration issues, such as account recovery, lock-outs and added friction in the authentication process.\n\nWorst of all, most legacy MFA solutions don’t meet the current minimum standards promulgated by OMB, which [noted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf) that SMS verification is not enough and that phishing-resistant MFA is required for agencies and their partners.\n\nOMB also mandated that “When authorizing users to access resources, agencies must consider at least one device-level signal alongside identity information about the authenticated user.” This particular directive requires that organisations think about strong authentication as two parts: authenticating the device and, separately, authenticating the user’s identity.\n\n### Higher-security solutions\n\nAdopting zero trust requires enterprise-wide authentication solutions that can be implemented and used easily. One such solution is biometrics authentication methods. Rather than relying on knowledge factors or possession factors, biometrics employ human factors, such as face, voice and fingerprints. With biometrics, additional security features like liveness detection can increase assurance that a live person is requesting access.\n\nBiometrics, whether device-based or cloud-based, also play a significant role in enabling phishing-resistant MFA as mandated by OMB. As we have learned from recent data breaches, human vulnerability is highly targeted and easily exploited via phishing, smishing and other social engineering attacks. Non-phishing resistant MFA leaves organisations extremely vulnerable and greatly lessens the efficacy and use ability of the zero trust framework. As OMB noted, the federal government’s Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard is one effective approach to phishing-resistant MFA, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C’s) open “Web Authentication” standard is another.\n\nOf these solutions, though, implementing FIDO2-compliant password-less authentication into the IAM and PAM layers could be the most seamless. At the front door, users login with FIDO2 to provide strong, phishing resistant MFA which works on the user’s native device. Once the user is past the front door, the organisation can set polices based on the resources being accessed by the user that request higher levels of identity confirmation such as cloud biometric authentication. This ensures that when the gate keeping components request authentication, the assurance levels are being raised beyond that of what was used in at the front door.\n\nImplementing enterprise-grade biometric authentication has several benefits for a zero-trust environment.\n\n  * Biometric authentication sits between the “untrusted zone” – the area before login and the “implicit trust zone” the area where all users are assumed to be trustworthy, behind login. Real-time solutions can be invoked whenever deemed necessary, and the “implicit trust zone” can be shrunk to whatever the organization decides\n  * Enterprise authentication solutions ideally will disallow any connection to a resource where the user fails biometric verification\n  * Authentication solutions should support conditional access with role-based access policies and the ability to be invoked based on the organizational risk acceptance\n\n\n\nThese technologies can be implemented at any point in a user journey to remove transient trust between applications and login sessions. Biometrics also offer a degree of seamlessness and ease of use that cannot be matched by knowledge- or possession-based factors.\n\n### The road to zero trust\n\nDespite the known benefits of adopting zero trust paradigms, the road to implementing it can be rocky.\n\nLegacy systems are often built on an implicit trust model, allowing those who have access to digital environments to have access to all data and resources without additional authentication. The cost to rebuild or replace IT infrastructure to transition fully from an implicit trust model to zero trust can be prohibitive for some organisations.\n\nFinally, zero trust is still an evolving concept. While the government and organisations like Forrester Consulting have promulgated standards, there is no consensus around the adoption of a maturity model. Organisations should be mindful that trust should not only be enforced at the perimeter, but should also be managed when users attempt to access privileged applications or assets. With zero trust, there is no more “chewy center” where users can move around freely, and device-based authentication by itself is not enough.\n\nOrganisations must be committed to increasing their security with strong authentication that includes device authentication paired with identity assurance that will help them accelerate their journey to zero trust.\n\n**Tom Thimot is CEO of identity
