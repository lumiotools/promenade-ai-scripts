We also have reached a key milestone in our global expansion by successfully delivering B-sample units for our worldwide shipping programs with a leading global automotive OEM. OEMs at home and abroad have widely recognized lidar's essential safety features as a critical component in their holistic safety systems, similar to an ‘active’ seat belt or airbag. Furthermore, lidar’s versatility, with applications in emerging areas such as industrial robotics, smart factories and logistics, continues to garner attention. Our latest flagship product, OT128, a 360° mechanical, automotive-grade long-range lidar, is designed for scalable deployment in robotaxi and industrial applications. We are actively exploring new use cases and engaging with customers across both ADAS and AM sectors, leveraging our full lineup of versatile lidars.\n\n“I am also delighted to announce that Andrew Fan has joined us as our Chief Financial Officer. Andrew brings a wealth of experience in financial strategy and corporate finance, as well as an impressive track record of driving growth and operational efficiency in dynamic industries. His insights and leadership will be invaluable as we navigate the evolving landscape and continue to strengthen our position in the global lidar industry,” Dr. Li continued. “Andrew's strategic vision aligns seamlessly with our goals, and I believe his commitment to innovation and financial rigor will help us unlock new levels of success. I am confident that with his expertise and dedication, we are well-positioned for another exciting chapter of growth and accomplishment.”\n\nMr. Andrew Fan, Hesai’s CFO, added, “Our strong third quarter financial performance was highlighted by robust operational execution across all key metrics. Quarterly shipment volume reached 134,208 units, marking our second consecutive quarter of nearly 50% sequential growth and propelling net revenues to RMB539.4 million (US$76.9 million), surpassing the upper range of our guidance. We maintained a robust blended gross margin of 47.7%, driven by effective cost management and our flywheel approach to cost and scale optimization. The margin was further bolstered by NRE revenues from our L4 lidar, which is being prepared for potential large-scale deployment by a leading global robotaxi player in the coming years. Our strong commitment to operational efficiency and financial discipline has also enabled us to consistently reduce our GAAP net loss for four consecutive quarters. Looking ahead, we’re expecting a record-breaking fourth quarter, with lidar shipments projected to reach 200,000 units—an astounding volume nearly matching our total shipments in 2023. Based on our current estimates, fourth quarter net revenues are expected to soar to nearly US$100 million, delivering an estimated net profit of US$20 million and a positive operating cash flow. Additionally, we anticipate achieving full-year profitability on a non-GAAP basis for 2024, positioning us to become the first automotive lidar company worldwide to achieve this remarkable milestone. This anticipated explosive growth underscores our robust momentum as we drive toward a landmark fiscal year finish!”\n\n  * **_Product Updates_****:**\n    * Launched the OT128, the Company’s latest flagship 360° mechanical automotive-grade long-range lidar product, at the 2024 IAA Transportation Fair in Germany.\n    * Inheriting 95% of the key components from Hesai's best-selling AT128P ADAS lidar, the OT128 boasts a point rate of 3.45 million per second and a 200-meter detection range at 10% reflectivity.

The Company’s lidar products enable a broad spectrum of applications across passenger and commercial vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle fleets (autonomous mobility). Hesai's technology also empowers robotics applications such as last-mile delivery robots and logistics robots in restricted areas. The Company’s commercially validated solutions are backed by superior R&D capabilities across optics, mechanics, and electronics. Hesai integrates lidar designs with an in-house manufacturing process, facilitating rapid product development while ensuring high performance, consistent quality and affordability. Hesai has established strong relationships with leading automotive OEMs, autonomous vehicle, and robotics companies worldwide, covering over 40 countries as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Use** **of** **Non-GAAP** **Financial** **Measures**\n\nTo supplement Hesai's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Hesai uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: loss from operation excluding share-based compensation expenses, net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses, net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation, and per ordinary share net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this release.\n\nHesai believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based compensation expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective. Hesai believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Hesai's historical performance and liquidity. Hesai believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude share-based compensation expenses that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP financial measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Exchange** **Rate** **Information**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.

Total lidar shipments rose 66.1% year-over-year to 86,526 units and blended gross margin remained robust at 45.1%, driven by effective cost management, our flywheel approach to cost and scale optimization, and additional service revenue contributions during the quarter. We are not aware of any other player in the global lidar industry that matches our financial strength while operating on such a massive delivery scale. Our quarterly net loss narrowed significantly by 32.6% quarter-over-quarter to RMB72.1 million (US$9.9 million).\n\n“We are thrilled to announce that Hesai has been recognized as the No. 1 automotive lidar company by market share for the third consecutive year by Yole Intelligence. This prestigious recognition fuels our ambition to achieve even greater success in our AM and ADAS businesses. As a global lidar leader, we are playing a pivotal role in the explosive growth and large-scale commercialization of China’s robotaxi market, evidenced by our selection as the exclusive long-range lidar supplier by all Top 5 robotaxi companies in China, including Baidu’s Apollo Go. Furthermore, our strategic approach of offering both ‘ultimate performance’ and ‘ultimate value-to-cost’ products is generating a robust ADAS order pipeline for 2025 and 2026, with millions of units expected to be shipped domestically and overseas based on customer demand forecasts. Notably, our landmark worldwide shipping programs with a leading automotive OEM are progressing to the delivery of B-samples, placing us well ahead of the competition globally,” added Dr. Li. “Our confidence in our future growth potential has never been higher, driven by strong momentum in the robotaxi and ADAS markets, regulatory developments and consumers’ increasing prioritization of safety. The lidar market in China has reached an exciting inflection point much earlier than expected, with a 22% adoption rate among EVs priced above RMB150,000 as of June. With our versatile product offerings and best-in-class manufacturing scalability, we are perfectly positioned to seize both domestic and international growth opportunities during this dynamic market capture phase.\n\n“Last but not least, we published our inaugural ESG Report this quarter, outlining our ongoing sustainable development efforts and accomplishments in ESG across our business operations. Looking forward, we remain committed to driving innovation and will continue to align our business goals with ESG best practices, creating long-term value for our stakeholders and our society,” Dr. Li concluded.\n\n  * **_Business Updates_****:**\n    * **Global** : \n      * Secured design wins with four prominent global OEMs, including three leading global OEMs’ joint ventures in China (two North American and one European automotive companies). In addition, the Company was selected by a leading global automotive OEM for its worldwide shipping programs, which are progressing toward the delivery of B-samples.\n      * Awarded new POC programs with two leading global OEMs from Europe, including a prestigious sports car brand, to test Hesai’s next-generation high-performance long-range and short-range lidars.\n    * **Domestic** : \n      * Selected as the exclusive long-range lidar supplier by all of the Top 5 robotaxi companies in China for their autonomous vehicles, including Baidu’s Apollo Go.\n      * Secured a series of new design wins for models set to launch starting in 2025 including a flagship model from a top-selling EV maker new to the Company’s client roster, as well as multiple new models and facelifts from existing customers who are among the largest EV shippers in China.\n      * Among these new design wins, a leading EV maker in China has already signed agreements with the Company to exclusively adopt Hesai’s next-generation L3 ultra-high-performance lidar for all of their new models scheduled for release in 2025.\n    * Hesai has secured ADAS design wins with 19 OEMs globally across over 70 vehicle models.\n  * **_ESG_****:** Hesai released its inaugural Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report detailing the Company’s 2023 ESG strategy and achievements, as well as its progress toward its longstanding ESG goals for sustainable development.

The Company’s lidar products enable a broad spectrum of applications across passenger and commercial vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle fleets (autonomous mobility). Hesai's technology also empowers robotics applications such as last-mile delivery robots and logistics robots in restricted areas. The Company’s commercially validated solutions are backed by superior R&D capabilities across optics, mechanics, and electronics. Hesai integrates lidar designs with an in-house manufacturing process, facilitating rapid product development while ensuring high performance, consistent quality and affordability. Hesai has established strong relationships with leading automotive OEMs, autonomous vehicle, and robotics companies worldwide, covering over 40 countries as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Use** **of** **Non-GAAP** **Financial** **Measures**\n\nTo supplement Hesai's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Hesai uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: loss from operation excluding share-based compensation expenses, net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses, net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation, and per ordinary share net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this release.\n\nHesai believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based compensation expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective. Hesai believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Hesai's historical performance and liquidity. Hesai believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude share-based compensation expenses that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP financial measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Exchange** **Rate** **Information**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.
