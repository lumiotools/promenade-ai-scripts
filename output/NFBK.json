(Nasdaq:NFBK) (the “Company”),** the holding company for Northfield Bank, reported net income of $6.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and $8.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income totaled $18.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $29.4 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income reflected $795,000, or $0.02 per share, of additional tax expense related to options that expired in June 2024, and $683,000, or $0.01 per share, of severance expense related to staffing realignments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income reflected $440,000, or $0.01 per share of severance expense. The decrease in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily the result of a decrease in net interest income, which was negatively impacted by higher funding costs, partially offset by improved interest and non-interest income.\n\nCommenting on the quarter, Steven M. Klein, the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “In the third quarter, the Northfield team continued to focus on financial performance, serving the businesses and consumers in our marketplace, and improving upon our operating efficiencies.” Mr. Klein continued, “We delivered solid financial performance for the quarter, increasing our net income, and earnings per share, as we manage our strong capital levels, core deposit and loan relationships, asset quality, and operating expenses. While significant risks remain, the decrease in short-term market interest rates late in the third quarter should provide increased economic activity in our marketplace and opportunities for our Company.”\n\nMr. Klein further noted, “I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per common share, payable on November 20, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 6, 2024.”\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nComparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nNet income was $18.7 million and $29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year period are as follows: a $10.9 million decrease in net interest income, a $1.3 million increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, a $1.5 million increase in non-interest income, a $3.2 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $3.1 million decrease in income tax expense.\n\nNet interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased $10.9 million, or 11.4%, to $84.8 million, from $95.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a $34.8 million increase in interest expense, which was partially offset by a $23.9 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest expense was largely driven by the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which increased by 96 basis points to 2.93% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.97% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by a 114 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits from 1.42% to 2.56% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a 31 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings from 3.58% to 3.89% due to rising market interest rates and a shift in the composition of the deposit portfolio towards higher-costing certificates of deposit and a greater reliance on borrowings. The increase in interest expense was also due to a $277.1 million, or 7.0%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, including an increase of $149.8 million in the average balance of borrowed funds and a $127.1 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $156.1 million, or 2.9%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with a 47 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, which increased to 4.35% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.88% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the rising rate environment. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily due to increases in the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $111.7 million, the average balance of other securities of $91.6 million, and the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of $88.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of loans of $133.4 million.\n\nNet interest margin decreased by 34 basis points to 2.07% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.41% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to interest-bearing liabilities repricing at a faster rate than interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was negatively affected by approximately 12 basis points due to a $300 million low risk leverage strategy implemented in the first quarter of 2024. In January 2024, the Company borrowed $300.0 million from the Federal Reserve Bank through the Bank Term Funding Program at favorable terms and conditions and invested the proceeds in interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions and investment securities. The Company accreted interest income related to purchased credit-deteriorated (“PCD”) loans of $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included loan prepayment income of $648,000 as compared to $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans increased by $1.3 million to $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the specific reserve component of the allowance for credit losses, which was partially offset by a decrease in the general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses. The increase in the specific reserve was related to a single commercial and industrial relationship totaling $12.5 million that experienced credit deterioration and was placed on non-accrual during the current quarter, which has a specific reserve of $1.3 million and incurred a charge-off of $878,000. The decline in the general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses resulted from a decline in loan balances and an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the current period within our Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, partially offset by an increase in reserves related to changes in model assumptions, including the slowing of prepayment speeds, and an increase in reserves in the commercial and industrial and home equity and lines of credit portfolios related to an increase in non-performing loans in these portfolios and higher loan balances. Net charge-offs were $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to $3.9 million in net charge-offs on small business unsecured commercial and industrial loans, as compared to net charge-offs of $5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Management continues to closely monitor the small business unsecured commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which totaled $31.0 million at September 30, 2024.\n\nNon-interest income increased by $1.5 million, or 18.7%, to $9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $790,000 in fees and service charges for customer services, related to an increase in overdraft fees and service charges on deposit accounts, $260,000 in income on bank owned life insurance, and $874,000 in gains on trading securities, net. Partially offsetting the increases was a $303,000 decrease in other income, primarily due to lower swap fee income. Gains on trading securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $1.6 million, as compared to $723,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The trading portfolio is utilized to fund the Company’s deferred compensation obligation to certain employees and directors of the plan. The participants of this plan, at their election, defer a portion of their compensation. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company’s obligations under the plan.\n\nNon-interest expense increased $3.2 million, or 5.2%, to $65.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $62.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $3.3 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, primarily attributable to higher salary expense, related to annual merit increases and higher medical expense, and an increase of $874,000 in deferred compensation expense, which is described above, and had no effect on net income. Employee compensation and benefits expense also includes severance expense of $683,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $440,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, due to current economic conditions, the Company implemented a workforce reduction plan which included modest layoffs and staffing realignments. The annual estimated cost savings of this plan is $2.0 million, pre-tax. Partially offsetting the increase was a $461,000 decrease in stock compensation expense related to performance stock awards not expected to vest. Additionally, non-interest expense included a $727,000 increase in credit loss expense/(benefit) for off-balance sheet exposure due to a provision of $337,000 recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a benefit of $390,000 for the comparative prior year period. The benefit in the prior year period was attributable to a decrease in the pipeline of loans committed and awaiting closing. Partially offsetting the increases was a $552,000 decrease in advertising expense due to a change in marketing strategy and the timing of specific deposit and lending campaigns.\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the decrease due to lower taxable income partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 29.7% compared to 27.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In June 2024, options granted in 2014 expired and resulted in additional tax expense of $795,000, contributing to the higher effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nNet income was $6.5 million and $8.2 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year quarter are as follows: a $1.5 million decrease in net interest income, a $2.4 increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, a $1.5 million increase in non-interest income, a $189,000 decrease in non-interest expense, and a $513,000 decrease in income tax expense.\n\nNet interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, decreased $1.5 million, or 4.9%, to $28.2 million, from $29.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, due to an $8.0 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by an $6.6 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest expense was largely driven by the impact of rising market interest rates and a $227.0 million, or 5.7%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, including increases of $158.4 million and $68.4 million in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $155.1 million, or 3.0%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with a 38 basis point increase in yields on interest-earning assets due to the rising rate environment. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was due to increases in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of $240.3 million, the average balance of other securities of $64.0 million, and the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $26.8 million, partially offset by decreases in the average balance of loans outstanding of $172.8 million and the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock of $3.2 million.\n\nNet interest margin decreased by 17 basis points to 2.08% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 2.25% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing faster than the repricing of interest-earning assets. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 64 basis points to 2.95% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 2.31% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by a 77 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits from 1.82% to 2.59%, and a 30 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings from 3.63% to 3.93%. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, which increased by 38 basis points to 4.38% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 4.00% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, included loan prepayment income of $87,000, as compared to $183,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company accreted interest income related to PCD loans of $327,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $325,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans increased by $2.4 million to $2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from a provision of $188,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the specific reserve component of the allowance for credit losses, which was partially offset by a decrease in the general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses. The increase in the specific reserve was related to a single commercial and industrial relationship that experienced credit deterioration and was placed on non-accrual during the current quarter, which has a specific reserve of $1.3 million and incurred a charge-off of $878,000. The decline in the general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses resulted from a decline in loan balances and an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the current period within our CECL model, partially offset by an increase in reserves related to changes in model assumptions, including the slowing of prepayment speeds, and an increase in reserves in the commercial and industrial portfolio related to an increase in non-performing loans and higher loan balances. Net charge-offs were $2.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and included $1.4 million in net charge-offs on small business unsecured loans, as compared to net charge-offs of $2.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNon-interest income increased by $1.5 million, or 68.7%, to $3.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from $2.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a $294,000 increase in fees and service charges, primarily related to higher overdraft fees, a $1.0 million increase in gains on trading securities, net, and a $185,000 increase in other income, primarily due to higher swap fee income. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, gains on trading securities, net, were $710,000, compared to losses of $295,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company’s obligations under the Plan.\n\nNon-interest expense decreased by $189,000, or 0.9%, to $20.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from $20.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $386,000 in occupancy expense, attributable to lower real estate taxes, common area maintenance and electricity costs, $214,000 in data processing costs, attributable to a decrease in ongoing core processing costs related to a prior technology-related contract renewed at favorable terms, and $132,000 in advertising expense. Partially offsetting the decreases was a $504,000 increase in compensation and employee benefits, which included a $1.0 million increase in expense related to the Company's deferred compensation plan which is described above, and had no effect on net income, that was offset by lower medical expense.\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, with the decrease due to lower taxable income. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 26.6%, compared to 26.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024\n\nNet income was $6.5 million and $6.0 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, respectively. Significant variances from the prior quarter are as follows: an $458,000 decrease in net interest income, a $3.2 million increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, a $719,000 increase in non-interest income, a $2.6 million decrease in non-interest expense, and an $850,000 decrease in income tax expense.\n\nNet interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $458,000, or 1.6%, primarily due to a $902,000 decrease in interest income, partially offset by a $444,000 decrease in interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to a $124.4 million decrease in the average balance of interest-earning assets. The decrease in the average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily due to decreases in the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $91.6 million, the average balance of other securities of $60.5 million, and the average balance of loans outstanding of $48.1 million, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of $76.5 million. The decrease in interest expense on deposits and borrowings was primarily due to a $105.8 million, or 2.5%, decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities attributable to a $73.2 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and a $32.7 million decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds.\n\nNet interest margin decreased by one basis point to 2.08% from 2.09% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to a one basis point decrease in yields on interest-earning assets whereas the cost of interest-bearing liabilities remained level. Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, included loan prepayment income of $87,000 as compared to $210,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company accreted interest income related to PCD loans of $327,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $321,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans increased by $3.2 million to $2.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from a benefit of $618,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the provision for the current quarter was primarily due to an increase in the specific reserve component of the allowance for credit losses, attributable to a single commercial and industrial relationship that experienced credit deterioration and was placed on non-accrual during the current quarter, higher reserves related to changes in model assumptions during the current quarter, including the slowing of prepayment speeds and higher net-charge-offs. Net charge-offs were $2.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net charge-offs of $1.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nNon-interest income increased by $719,000, or 25.1%, to $3.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from $2.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a $522,000 increase in gains on sales of trading securities, net, and a $192,000 increase in other income, primarily due to higher swap fee income. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, gains on trading securities, net, were $710,000, compared to gains of $188,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nNon-interest expense decreased by $2.6 million, or 11.4%, to $20.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from $23.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.0 million decrease in compensation and employee benefits, primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and medical expense due to lower employee headcount, partially offset by a $522,000 increase in expense related to the Company's deferred compensation plan which had no effect on net income. Also contributing to the decrease were decreases of $192,000 in occupancy expense, $397,000 in data processing costs, attributable to a decrease in ongoing core processing costs resulting from a prior technology-related contract renewed at favorable terms, $200,000 in advertising expense, and $122,000 in other non-interest expense. Partially offsetting the decreases was a $262,000 increase in professional fees, primarily due to an increase in outsourced audit services.\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 26.6%, compared to 35.0% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, options granted in 2014 expired and resulted in additional tax expense of $795,000, contributing to the higher effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Condition**\n\nTotal assets increased by $132.5 million, or 2.4%, to $5.73 billion at September 30, 2024, from $5.60 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in available-for-sale debt securities of $268.0 million, or 33.7%, and cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 million, or 1.5%, partially offset by a decrease in loans receivable of $139.7 million, or 3.3%.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $3.4 million, or 1.5%, to $232.9 million at September 30, 2024, from $229.5 million at December 31, 2023. Balances fluctuate based on the timing of receipt of security and loan repayments and the redeployment of cash into higher-yielding assets such as loans and securities, or the funding of deposit outflows or borrowing maturities.\n\nLoans held-for-investment, net, decreased by $139.7 million, or 3.3%, to $4.06 billion at September 30, 2024 from $4.20 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to decreases in multifamily, commercial and one-to-four family residential real estate loans, partially offset by increases in home equity and lines of credit, construction and land, and commercial and industrial loans. The decrease in loan balances reflects the Company remaining strategically focused on both managing the concentration of its commercial and multifamily real estate loan portfolios and disciplined loan pricing, as well as lower customer demand in the recent elevated interest rate environment. Multifamily loans decreased $110.1 million, or 4.0%, to $2.64 billion at September 30, 2024 from $2.75 billion at December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans decreased $51.4 million, or 5.5%, to $878.2 million at September 30, 2024 from $929.6 million at December 31, 2023, one-to-four family residential loans decreased $11.1 million, or 6.9%, to $149.7 million at September 30, 2024 from $160.8 million at December 31, 2023, and other loans decreased $925,000, or 35.8%, to $1.7 million at September 30, 2024 from $2.6 million at December 31, 2023. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in commercial and industrial loans of $19.1 million, or 12.3%, to $174.4 million at September 30, 2024 from $155.3 million at December 31, 2023, home equity and lines of credit of $8.4 million, or 5.2%, to $171.9 million at September 30, 2024 from $163.5 million at December 31, 2023, and construction and land loans of $2.1 million, or 6.6%, to $33.0 million at September 30, 2024 from $31.0 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans (as defined by regulatory guidance) to total risk-based capital was estimated at approximately 447%. Management believes that Northfield Bank (the “Bank”) maintains appropriate risk management practices including risk assessments, board-approved underwriting policies and related procedures, which include monitoring Bank portfolio performance, performing market analysis (economic and real estate), and stressing of the Bank’s commercial real estate portfolio under severe, adverse economic conditions. Although management believes the Bank has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to manage its commercial real estate concentration risk, the Bank’s regulators could require it to implement additional policies and procedures or could require it to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, which might adversely affect its loan originations, the Company's ability to pay dividends, and overall profitability.\n\nOur real estate portfolio includes credit risk exposure to loans collateralized by office buildings and multifamily properties in New York State subject to some form of rent regulation limiting rent increases for rent stabilized multifamily properties. At September 30, 2024, office-related loans represented $183.6 million, or 4.5% of our total loan portfolio, with an average balance of $1.7 million (although we have originated these type of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average) and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 59%. Approximately 41% were owner-occupied. The geographic locations of the properties collateralizing our office-related loans are: 50.7% in New York, 47.8% in New Jersey and 1.5% in Pennsylvania. At September 30, 2024, our largest office-related loan had a principal balance of $90.0 million (with a net active principal balance for the Bank of $29.9 million as we have a 33.3% participation interest), was secured by an office facility located in Staten Island, New York, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. At September 30, 2024, multifamily loans that have some form of rent stabilization or rent control totaled approximately $447.5 million, or approximately 11% of our total loan portfolio, with an average balance of $1.7 million (although we have originated these type of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average) and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 51%. At September 30, 2024, our largest rent-regulated loan had a principal balance of $16.9 million, was secured by an apartment building located in Staten Island, New York, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. Management continues to closely monitor its office and rent-regulated portfolios. For further details on our rent-regulated multifamily portfolio see “Asset Quality”.\n\nPCD loans totaled $9.3 million and $9.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of the remaining PCD loan balance consists of loans acquired as part of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-assisted transaction. The Company accreted interest income of $327,000 and $1.1 million attributable to PCD loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $325,000 and $1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. PCD loans had an allowance for credit losses of approximately $2.9 million at September 30, 2024.\n\nLoan balances are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nReal estate loans:  \nMultifamily| $|  2,640,944| $|  2,665,202| $|  2,750,996  \nCommercial mortgage|  878,173|  896,157|  929,595  \nOne-to-four family residential mortgage|  149,682|  151,948|  160,824  \nHome equity and lines of credit|  171,946|  167,852|  163,520  \nConstruction and land|  33,024|  32,607|  30,967  \nTotal real estate loans|  3,873,769|  3,913,766|  4,035,902  \nCommercial and industrial loans|  174,253|  165,586|  154,984  \nPPP loans|  160|  202|  284  \nOther loans|  1,660|  2,322|  2,585  \nTotal commercial and industrial, PPP, and other loans|  176,073|  168,110|  157,853  \nLoans held-for-investment, net (excluding PCD)|  4,049,842|  4,081,876|  4,193,755  \nPCD loans|  9,264|  9,344|  9,899  \nTotal loans held-for-investment, net| $|  4,059,106| $|  4,091,220| $|  4,203,654  \n  \nThe Company’s available-for-sale debt securities portfolio increased by $268.0 million, or 33.7%, to $1.06 billion at September 30, 2024, from $795.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to purchases of securities, partially offset by paydowns, maturities and calls. At September 30, 2024, $869.4 million of the portfolio consisted of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. In addition, the Company held $74.9 million in U.S. Government agency securities, $118.5 million in corporate bonds, substantially all of which were investment grade, and $684,000 in municipal bonds at September 30, 2024. Unrealized losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities and held-to-maturity securities approximated $19.6 million and $219,000, respectively, at September 30, 2024, and $32.5 million and $279,000, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\n\nEquity securities were $10.7 million at September 30, 2024 and $10.6 million at December 31, 2023. Equity securities are primarily comprised of an investment in a Small Business Administration Loan Fund. This investment is utilized by the Bank as part of its Community Reinvestment Act program.\n\nTotal liabilities increased $132.3 million, or 2.7%, to $5.03 billion at September 30, 2024, from $4.90 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in borrowings of $131.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in total deposits of $2.9 million. The Company routinely utilizes brokered deposits and borrowed funds to manage interest rate risk, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and funding needs related to loan originations and deposit activity.\n\nDeposits decreased $2.9 million, or 0.1%, to $3.88 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. Brokered deposits decreased by $17.9 million, or 17.9%, due to maturities that were replaced by borrowings. Deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased $15.0 million, or 0.4%. The increase in deposits, excluding brokered deposits, was primarily attributable to increases of $80.9 million in time deposits, partially offset by decreases of $14.9 million in transaction accounts, $14.7 million in savings accounts, and $36.3 million in money market accounts. Growth in time deposits was attributable to the current interest rate environment and offering competitive interest rates to attract deposits. Estimated gross uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 were $1.71 billion. This total includes fully collateralized uninsured governmental deposits and intercompany deposits of $859.3 million, leaving estimated uninsured deposits of approximately $852.2 million, or 22.0%, of total deposits. At December 31, 2023, estimated uninsured deposits totaled $869.9 million, or 22.4% of total deposits.\n\nDeposit account balances are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nTransaction:  \nNon-interest bearing checking| $|  681,741| $|  685,574| $|  694,903  \nNegotiable orders of withdrawal and interest-bearing checking|  1,230,176|  1,251,342|  1,231,943  \nTotal transaction|  1,911,917|  1,936,916|  1,926,846  \nSavings and money market:  \nSavings|  911,067|  916,598|  925,744  \nMoney market|  265,800|  255,550|  302,122  \nBrokered money market|  —|  —|  50,000  \nTotal savings|  1,176,867|  1,172,148|  1,277,866  \nCertificates of deposit:  \n$250,000 and under|  585,606|  568,809|  525,454  \nOver $250,000|  119,033|  120,601|  98,269  \nBrokered|  82,146|  —|  50,000  \nTotal certificates of deposit|  786,785|  689,410|  673,723  \nTotal deposits| $|  3,875,569| $|  3,798,474| $|  3,878,435  \n  \nIncluded in the table above are business and municipal deposit account balances as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nBusiness customers| $|  869,990| $|  866,403| $|  893,296  \nMunicipal (governmental) customers| $|  799,249| $|  815,086| $|  768,556  \n  \nBorrowed funds increased to $1.05 billion at September 30, 2024, from $920.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in borrowings for the period was primarily due to a $205.5 million increase in borrowings under the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program, which included favorable terms and conditions as compared to FHLB advances. Management utilizes borrowings to mitigate interest rate risk, for short-term liquidity, and to a lesser extent from time to time, as part of leverage strategies.\n\nThe following table sets forth borrowing maturities (excluding overnight borrowings and subordinated debt) and the weighted average rate by year at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n\n**Year**| **Amount****(1)**| **Weighted Average Rate**  \n---|---|---  \n2024| $25,000| 4.71%  \n2025| 483,184| 4.00%  \n2026| 148,000| 4.36%  \n2027| 173,000| 3.19%  \n2028| 154,288| 3.96%  \n$983,472| 3.92%  \n__________________________________________________  \n(1)  Borrowings maturing in 2025 include $300.0 million of FRB borrowings that can be repaid without any penalty.  \n  \nTotal stockholders’ equity increased by $119,000 to $699.6 million at September 30, 2024, from $699.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was attributable to net income of $18.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a $14.1 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, associated with an increase in the estimated fair value of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio due to the increase in market interest rates, and a $1.9 million increase in equity award activity, partially offset by $18.1 million in stock repurchases and $16.5 million in dividend payments. On April 24, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $5.0 million stock repurchase program, which was completed in May 2024, and on June 14, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $10.0 million stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.8 million of its common stock outstanding at an average price of $10.03 for a total of $18.1 million pursuant to the approved stock repurchase programs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no remaining capacity under its current repurchase program.\n\nThe Company's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, corporate bonds, and unpledged mortgage-related securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, that we can either borrow against or sell. We also have the ability to surrender bank-owned life insurance contracts. The surrender of these contracts would subject the Company to income taxes and penalties for increases in the cash surrender values over the original premium payments. We also have the ability to obtain additional funding from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of New York utilizing unencumbered and unpledged securities and multifamily loans. The Company expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current commitments in the normal course of business. The Company's on-hand liquidity ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 16.4%.\n\nThe Company had the following primary sources of liquidity at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): \n\nCash and cash equivalents(1)| $| 218,733  \n---|---|---  \nCorporate bonds(2)| $| 104,633  \nMultifamily loans(2)| $| 699,343  \nMortgage-backed securities (issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac)(2)| $| 491,985  \n__________________________________________________  \n(1) Excludes $14.2 million of cash at Northfield Bank.  \n(2) Represents estimated remaining borrowing potential.  \n  \nThe Company and the Bank utilize the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”) framework. The CBLR replaces the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rules. At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank's estimated CBLR ratios were 12.03% and 12.26%, respectively, which exceeded the minimum requirement to be considered well-capitalized of 9%.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe following table details total non-accrual loans (excluding PCD), non-performing assets, loans over 90 days delinquent on which interest is accruing, and accruing loans 30 to 89 days delinquent at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nNon-accrual loans:  \nHeld-for-investment  \nReal estate loans:  \nMultifamily| $|  2,651| $|  2,691| $|  2,709  \nCommercial|  8,823|  10,244|  6,491  \nOne-to-four family residential|  66|  69|  104  \nHome equity and lines of credit|  1,123|  1,124|  499  \nCommercial and industrial|  15,117|  2,570|  305  \nOther|  6|  6|  7  \n**Total non-accrual loans**|  27,786|  16,704|  10,115  \nLoans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing:  \nHeld-for-investment  \nReal estate loans:  \nMultifamily|  —|  —|  201  \nCommercial|  1,161|  —|  —  \nOne-to-four family residential|  304|  136|  406  \nHome equity and lines of credit|  343|  467|  711  \nCommercial and industrial|  835|  —|  —  \nTotal loans held-for-investment delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing|  2,643|  603|  1,318  \n**Total non-performing loans/assets**|  $|  30,429| $|  17,307| $|  11,433  \nNon-performing loans to total loans|  0.75| %|  0.42| %|  0.27| %  \nNon-performing assets to total assets|  0.53| %|  0.30| %|  0.20| %  \n**Accruing loans 30 to 89 days delinquent**|  $|  16,057| $|  6,265| $|  8,683  \n  \nThe Company's non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 totaled $30.4 million, or 0.75%, of total loans as compared to $11.4 million, or 0.27%, at December 31, 2023. The $19.0 million increase in non-performing loans was primarily attributable to an increase in non-performing commercial and industrial loans of $15.6 million and an increase of $3.5 million in non-performing commercial real estate loans. One commercial and industrial relationship with an outstanding balance of $12.5 million at September 30, 2024, experienced credit deterioration and was placed on non-accrual status during the third quarter of 2024. The loan is currently in the process of being restructured and we expect to receive a partial payment of $10.0 million on or before October 31, 2024, with the remaining $2.5 million to be repaid over three years. The loan was individually evaluated for impairment, we charged off $878,000 and provided a specific reserve of $1.3 million. Additionally, management evaluated the collateral from the Company and assets subject to personal guarantees and, based on current estimates, believes there is adequate collateral and assets to support the current value of the loan absent the expected repayment of $10.0 million. Another commercial and industrial relationship with an outstanding balance of $750,000 is in the process of maturity extension. Additionally, there was an increase in non-performing unsecured small business loans. Unsecured small business loans totaled $31.0 million and $37.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management continues to closely monitor the small business unsecured commercial and industrial loan portfolio.\n\nThe increase in non-performing commercial real estate loans was primarily attributable to one loan with a balance of $4.4 million, which was put on non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2024. Based on the results of the impairment analysis for this loan, no impairment reserve was necessary as the loan is adequately covered by collateral (a private residence and retail property, both located in New Jersey), with aggregate appraised values totaling $8.7 million.\n\nAccruing Loans 30 to 89 Days Delinquent\n\nLoans 30 to 89 days delinquent and on accrual status totaled $16.1 million, $6.3 million and $8.7 million at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table sets forth delinquencies for accruing loans by type and by amount at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): \n\n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nHeld-for-investment  \nReal estate loans:  \nMultifamily| $|  2,259| $|  168| $|  740  \nCommercial|  5,689|  1,557|  1,010  \nOne-to-four family residential|  2,286|  1,769|  3,339  \nHome equity and lines of credit|  1,369|  786|  817  \nCommercial and industrial loans|  4,450|  1,977|  2,767  \nOther loans|  4|  8|  10  \nTotal delinquent accruing loans held-for-investment| $|  16,057| $|  6,265| $|  8,683  \n  \nThe increase in multifamily delinquent loans was primarily due to two relationships totaling $1.5 million that became current subsequent to September 30, 2024. The increase in commercial real estate delinquent loans was primarily due to two participation loans totaling $5.6 million that matured, and the lead bank is in the process of extending their maturity and should become current in the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase in commercial and industrial delinquent loans from December 31, 2023, was primarily due to two loans to one borrower totaling $1.5 million which we expect to become current in the fourth quarter of 2024, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in delinquencies in unsecured small business loans.\n\nSubsequent to the quarter end, $1.1 million of home equity and lines of credit loans, $1.5 million of one-to-four family residential loans, and $1.5 million of commercial and industrial loans became current.\n\nPCD Loans (Held-for-Investment)\n\nThe Company accounts for PCD loans at estimated fair value using discounted expected future cash flows deemed to be collectible on the date acquired. Based on its detailed review of PCD loans and experience in loan workouts, management believes it has a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of future cash flows and accordingly has classified PCD loans ($9.3 million at September 30, 2024 and $9.9 million at December 31, 2023, respectively) as accruing, even though they may be contractually past due. At September 30, 2024, 2.1% of PCD loans were past due 30 to 89 days, and 24.6% were past due 90 days or more, as compared to 2.9% and 27.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\n\nOur multifamily loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 totaled $2.64 billion, or 65% of our total loan portfolio, of which $447.5 million, or 11%, included loans collateralized by properties in New York with units subject to some percentage of rent regulation.

(Nasdaq:NFBK) (the “Company”),** the holding company for Northfield Bank, reported net income of $6.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $6.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $9.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, net income totaled $12.2 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $21.3 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, net income included $795,000 of additional tax expense related to options that expired in June 2024, and $683,000 of severance expense related to staffing resource realignments. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, net income included $440,000, or $0.01 per share of severance expense. The decrease in net income for both the current quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year periods was primarily the result of a decrease in net interest income, which was negatively impacted by higher funding costs.\n\nCommenting on the quarter, Steven M. Klein, the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “In the second quarter, the Northfield team remained focused on the fundamentals of serving our communities, developing and building on relationships, and improving upon our efficiencies.” Mr. Klein continued, “We delivered solid financial performance for the quarter prudently managing loan and deposit balances, maintaining strong asset quality, and managing our expenses, and while significant risks remain, including the level of inflation and interest rate movements, we have effectively managed our cost of funds, and with assets repricing higher, net interest income increased as compared to the prior quarter.”\n\nMr. Klein concluded, “We will continue to prudently manage our strong capital and liquidity and focus on our Locally Grown approach to community commercial banking, and I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per common share, payable on August 21, 2024, to stockholders of record on August 7, 2024.”\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nComparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nNet income was $12.2 million and $21.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year period are as follows: a $9.5 million decrease in net interest income, a $1.1 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans, a $3.4 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $2.6 million decrease in income tax expense. \n\nNet interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, decreased $9.5 million, or 14.4%, to $56.6 million, from $66.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to a $26.8 million increase in interest expense, which was partially offset by a $17.3 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest expense was largely driven by the cost of interest-bearing liabilities which increased by 112 basis points to 2.92% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 1.80% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, driven primarily by a 134 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits from 1.21% to 2.55% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and a 31 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings from 3.56% to 3.87% due to rising market interest rates and a shift in the composition of the deposit portfolio towards higher-costing certificates of deposit and a greater reliance on borrowings. The increase in interest expense was also due to a $302.3 million, or 7.6%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, including an increase of $191.0 million in the average balance of borrowed funds and a $111.2 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $156.4 million, or 2.9%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with a 51 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets which increased to 4.33% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 3.82% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, due to the rising rate environment. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily due to increases in the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $154.7 million, the average balance of other securities of $105.4 million, and the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of $11.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of loans of $113.5 million.\n\nNet interest margin decreased by 42 basis points to 2.06% from 2.48% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to interest-bearing liabilities repricing at a faster rate than interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was negatively affected by approximately 12 basis points due to a $300 million low risk leverage strategy in the first quarter of 2024. The Company accreted interest income related to purchased credit-deteriorated (“PCD”) loans of $747,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $678,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, included loan prepayment income of $561,000 as compared to $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans decreased by $1.1 million to a benefit of $203,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a provision of $894,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to a decline in loan balances and an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the current period within our Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. Partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in reserves in the commercial and industrial and home equity and lines of credit portfolios related to an increase in non-performing loans in these portfolios and higher loan balances. Net charge-offs were $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to $2.4 million in net charge-offs on small business unsecured commercial and industrial loans, as compared to net charge-offs of $2.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Management continues to closely monitor the small business unsecured commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which totaled $33.6 million at June 30, 2024.\n\nNon-interest income remained stable at $6.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $6.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Fees and service charges increased by $496,000, primarily due to an increase in overdraft fees and service charges on deposit accounts, which was partially offset by a decrease in other non-interest income of $488,000, primarily due to lower swap fee income.\n\nNon-interest expense increased $3.4 million, or 8.2%, to $45.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $41.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, primarily attributable to higher salary expense, related to annual merit increases, an increase in medical expense, and an increase in severance expense to $683,000 as compared to $440,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Partially offsetting the increase was a $461,000 decrease in stock compensation expense related to performance stock awards not expected to vest. During the second quarter of 2024, due to current economic conditions, the Company implemented a workforce reduction plan which included modest layoffs and staffing resource realignments. The annual estimated cost savings of this plan is $2.0 million, pre-tax. Additionally, there was a $736,000 increase in credit loss expense/(benefit) for off-balance sheet exposure due to a provision of $186,000 recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a benefit of $550,000 for the comparative prior year period. The benefit in the prior year period was attributable to a decrease in the pipeline of loans committed and awaiting closing. There was also an increase of $311,000 in other non-interest expense, primarily office and miscellaneous expenses. Partially offsetting the increases was a $249,000 decrease in professional fees, and a $420,000 decrease in advertising expense due to a change in marketing strategy and the timing of specific deposit and lending campaigns.\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $5.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $8.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, with the decrease due to lower taxable income partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 31.2% compared to 27.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. In June 2024, options granted in 2014 expired and resulted in additional tax expense of $795,000, contributing to the higher effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 \n\nNet income was $6.0 million and $9.6 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year quarter are as follows: a $2.5 million decrease in net interest income, a $648,000 decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans, a $2.2 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $399,000 decrease in income tax expense. \n\nNet interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, decreased $2.5 million, or 7.9%, to $28.7 million, from $31.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, due to an $11.0 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by an $8.6 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest expense was largely driven by the impact of rising market interest rates and a $288.7 million, or 7.2%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, including increases of $251.0 million and $37.6 million in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a $177.4 million, or 3.3%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with a 51 basis point increase in yields on interest-earning assets due to the rising rate environment. The increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was due to increases in the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $123.6 million, the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of $121.1 million, and the average balance of other securities of $94.6 million, partially offset by decreases in the average balance of loans outstanding of $156.8 million and the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock of $5.2 million.\n\nNet interest margin decreased by 25 basis points to 2.09% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from 2.34% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing faster than the repricing of interest-earning assets. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 90 basis points to 2.95% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from 2.05% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, driven primarily by a 117 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits from 1.43% to 2.60%, and a 20 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings from 3.68% to 3.88%. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets which increased by 51 basis points to 4.39% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from 3.88% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, included loan prepayment income of $210,000, as compared to $194,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The Company accreted interest income related to PCD loans of $321,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $337,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans decreased by $648,000 to a benefit of $618,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from a provision of $30,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in loan balances and an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the current quarter within our CECL model. Partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in reserves in the commercial and industrial and home equity and lines of credit portfolios related to an increase in non-performing loans in these portfolios and higher balances and an increase in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs were $1.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $313,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, due to $1.5 million in net charge-offs on small business unsecured commercial and industrial loans.\n\nNon-interest income increased by $43,000, or 1.5%, to $2.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from $2.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to a $261,000 increase in fees and service charges, primarily related to higher overdraft fees, partially offset by a $318,000 decrease in gains on trading securities. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, gains on trading securities, net, were $188,000, compared to gains of $506,000 in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The trading portfolio is utilized to fund the Company’s deferred compensation obligation to certain employees and directors of the Company's deferred compensation plan (the “Plan”). The participants of this Plan, at their election, defer a portion of their compensation. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company’s obligations under the Plan.\n\nNon-interest expense increased by $2.2 million, or 10.7%, to $23.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from $20.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in compensation and employee benefits, primarily attributable to higher salary expense related to annual merit increases, an increase in medical expense and an increase in severance expense to $683,000 as compared to $440,000 in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Partially offsetting the increase was a $461,000 decrease in stock compensation expense related to performance stock awards not expected to vest and a $318,000 decrease in the mark to market of the Company's deferred compensation plan expense, which as discussed above has no effect on net income. Also contributing to the increase was a $764,000 increase in the credit loss expense/(benefit) for off-balance sheet exposures which was due to $103,000 of expense recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to a benefit of $661,000 recorded in the prior year quarter. The benefit in the prior year quarter was attributable to a decrease in the pipeline of loans committed and awaiting closing. There was also a $415,000 increase in other non-interest expense.\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $3.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $3.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, with the decrease due to lower taxable income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was 35.0%, compared to 27.4% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, options granted in 2014 expired and resulted in additional tax expense of $795,000, contributing to the higher effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024\n\nNet income was $6.0 million and $6.2 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, respectively. Significant variances from the prior quarter are as follows: an $803,000 increase in net interest income, a $1.0 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans, a $522,000 decrease in non-interest income, a $661,000 increase in non-interest expense, and a $910,000 increase in income tax expense.\n\nNet interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased by $803,000, or 2.9%, primarily due to a $1.6 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $769,000 increase in interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 12 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets to 4.39% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from 4.27% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to higher yields on loans and securities, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in the average balance of interest-earning assets. The decrease in the average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily due to decreases in the average balance of interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $71.4 million, the average balance of other securities of $58.1 million, and the average balance of loans outstanding of $46.6 million, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities of $175.7 million. The increase in interest expense on deposits and borrowings was primarily due to an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of six basis points to 2.95% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from 2.89% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 as well as a $5.2 million, or 0.1%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities attributable to a $73.0 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits which was partially offset by a decrease of $67.8 million in the average balance of borrowed funds.\n\nNet interest margin increased by six basis points to 2.09% from 2.03% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to the increase in yields on interest-earning assets outpacing the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, included loan prepayment income of $210,000 as compared to $351,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Company accreted interest income related to PCD loans of $321,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $426,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nThe provision for credit losses on loans decreased by $1.0 million to a benefit of $618,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from a provision of $415,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The benefit in the current quarter was primarily due to a decrease in loan balances and an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the current quarter within our CECL model. Partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in reserves in the commercial and industrial and home equity and lines of credit portfolios related to an increase in non-performing loans in these portfolios as well as higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs were $1.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to $1.5 million in net charge-offs on small business unsecured commercial and industrial loans, as compared to net charge-offs of $911,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nNon-interest income decreased by $522,000, or 15.4%, to $2.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from $3.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a $511,000 decrease in gains on sales of trading securities, net. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, gains on trading securities, net, were $188,000, compared to gains of $699,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values.\n\nNon-interest expense increased by $661,000, or 3.0%, to $23.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from $22.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a $623,000 increase in compensation and employee benefits, primarily attributable to an increase in medical expense and an increase in severance expense of $683,000, partially offset by a $461,000 decrease in stock compensation expense related to performance stock awards not expected to vest and a $511,000 decrease in the mark to market of the Company's deferred compensation plan expense. Also contributing to the increase was an increase of $429,000 in other non-interest expense. Partially offsetting the increases were decreases of $331,000 in occupancy expense, primarily lower repairs and maintenance costs and $128,000 in professional fees, primarily lower audit fees.\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $3.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $2.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was 35.0%, compared to 27.0% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, options granted in 2014 expired and resulted in additional tax expense of $795,000, contributing to the higher effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the previous quarter.\n\n**Financial Condition**\n\nTotal assets increased by $148.0 million, or 2.6%, to $5.75 billion at June 30, 2024, from $5.60 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in available-for-sale debt securities of $324.0 million, or 40.7%, equity securities of $3.3 million, or 31.4%, and other assets of $3.2 million, or 6.6%, partially offset by decreases in loans receivable of $112.4 million, or 2.7%, and cash and cash equivalents of $76.0 million, or 33.1%.\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $76.0 million, or 33.1%, to $153.5 million at June 30, 2024, from $229.5 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“FRB”) balances. Balances fluctuate based on the timing of receipt of security and loan repayments and the redeployment of cash into higher-yielding assets such as loans and securities, or the funding of deposit outflows or borrowing maturities.\n\nLoans held-for-investment, net, decreased by $112.4 million, or 2.7%, to $4.09 billion at June 30, 2024 from $4.20 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to decreases in multifamily and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by increases in home equity and lines of credit, construction and land, and commercial and industrial loans. The decrease in loan balances reflects the Company remaining strategically focused on both managing the concentration of its commercial and multifamily real estate loan portfolios and disciplined loan pricing, as well as lower customer demand in the current elevated interest rate environment. Multifamily loans decreased $85.8 million, or 3.1%, to $2.67 billion at June 30, 2024 from $2.75 billion at December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans decreased $33.4 million, or 3.6%, to $896.2 million at June 30, 2024 from $929.6 million at December 31, 2023, one-to-four family residential loans decreased $8.9 million, or 5.5%, to $151.9 million at June 30, 2024 from $160.8 million at December 31, 2023, and other loans decreased $263,000, or 10.2%, to $2.3 million at June 30, 2024 from $2.6 million at December 31, 2023. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in commercial and industrial loans of $10.5 million, or 6.8%, to $165.8 million at June 30, 2024 from $155.3 million at December 31, 2023, home equity and lines of credit of $4.3 million, or 2.6%, to $167.9 million at June 30, 2024 from $163.5 million at December 31, 2023, and construction and land loans of $1.6 million, or 5.3%, to $32.6 million at June 30, 2024 from $31.0 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans (as defined by regulatory guidance) to total risk-based capital was estimated at approximately 456%. Management believes that Northfield Bank (the “Bank”) maintains appropriate risk management practices including risk assessments, board-approved underwriting policies and related procedures, which include monitoring Bank portfolio performance, performing market analysis (economic and real estate), and stressing of the Bank’s commercial real estate portfolio under severe, adverse economic conditions. Although management believes the Bank has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to manage its commercial real estate concentration risk, the Bank’s regulators could require it to implement additional policies and procedures or could require it to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, which might adversely affect its loan originations, the Company's ability to pay dividends, and overall profitability.\n\nOur real estate portfolio includes credit risk exposure to loans collateralized by office buildings and multifamily properties in New York State subject to some form of rent regulation limiting rent increases for rent stabilized multifamily properties. At June 30, 2024, office-related loans represented $199.6 million, or approximately 5% of our total loan portfolio, with an average balance of $1.8 million (although we have originated these type of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average) and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 58%. Approximately 45% were owner-occupied. The geographic locations of the properties collateralizing our office-related loans are: 55.4% in New York and 44.6% in New Jersey. At June 30, 2024, our largest office-related loan had a principal balance of $90.0 million (with a net active principal balance for the Bank of $30.0 million as we have a 33.3% participation interest), was secured by an office facility located in Staten Island, New York, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. At June 30, 2024, multifamily loans that have some form of rent stabilization or rent control totaled approximately $440.0 million, or approximately 11% of our total loan portfolio, with an average balance of $1.7 million (although we have originated these type of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average) and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 52%. At June 30, 2024, our largest rent-regulated loan had a principal balance of $17.0 million, was secured by an apartment building located in Staten Island, New York, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. Management continues to closely monitor its office and rent-regulated portfolios. For further details on our rent-regulated multifamily portfolio see “Asset Quality”.\n\nPCD loans totaled $9.3 million and $9.9 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The majority of the remaining PCD loan balance consists of loans acquired as part of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-assisted transaction. The Company accreted interest income of $321,000 and $747,000 attributable to PCD loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $337,000 and $678,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. PCD loans had an allowance for credit losses of approximately $2.9 million at June 30, 2024.\n\nLoan balances are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nReal estate loans:  \nMultifamily| $| 2,665,202| $| 2,715,919| $| 2,750,996  \nCommercial mortgage| 896,157| 916,112| 929,595  \nOne-to-four family residential mortgage| 151,948| 156,276| 160,824  \nHome equity and lines of credit| 167,852| 163,493| 163,520  \nConstruction and land| 32,607| 30,514| 30,967  \nTotal real estate loans| 3,913,766| 3,982,314| 4,035,902  \nCommercial and industrial loans| 165,586| 168,321| 154,984  \nPPP loans| 202| 243| 284  \nOther loans| 2,322| 1,641| 2,585  \nTotal commercial and industrial, PPP, and other loans| 168,110| 170,205| 157,853  \nLoans held-for-investment, net (excluding PCD)| 4,081,876| 4,152,519| 4,193,755  \nPCD loans| 9,344| 9,953| 9,899  \nTotal loans held-for-investment, net| $| 4,091,220| $| 4,162,472| $| 4,203,654  \n  \nThe Company’s available-for-sale debt securities portfolio increased by $324.0 million, or 40.7%, to $1.12 billion at June 30, 2024, from $795.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to purchases of securities, partially offset by paydowns, maturities and calls. At June 30, 2024, $821.5 million of the portfolio consisted of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. In addition, the Company held $74.6 million in U.S. Treasuries, $74.1 million in U.S. Government agency securities, $148.4 million in corporate bonds, substantially all of which were investment grade, and $765,000 in municipal bonds at June 30, 2024. Unrealized losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities and held-to-maturity securities approximated $29.9 million and $389,000, respectively, at June 30, 2024, and $32.5 million and $279,000, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\n\nEquity securities were $14.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $10.6 million at December 31, 2023. Equity securities are primarily comprised of an investment in a Small Business Administration Loan Fund. This investment is utilized by the Bank as part of its Community Reinvestment Act program.\n\nTotal liabilities increased $154.4 million, or 3.2%, to $5.05 billion at June 30, 2024, from $4.90 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in borrowings of $230.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in total deposits of $80.0 million. The Company routinely utilizes brokered deposits and borrowed funds to manage interest rate risk, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and funding needs related to loan originations and deposit activity.\n\nDeposits decreased $80.0 million, or 2.1%, to $3.80 billion at June 30, 2024, as compared to $3.88 billion at December 31, 2023. Brokered deposits decreased by $100.0 million, or 100.0%, due to maturities that were replaced by borrowings during the quarter. Deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased $20.0 million, or 0.5%. The increase in deposits, excluding brokered deposits, was primarily attributable to increases of $10.1 million in transaction accounts and $65.7 million in time deposits, partially offset by decreases of $9.1 million in savings accounts and $46.6 million in money market accounts. Transaction growth was attributable to dedicated business development efforts, including targeted marketing mailings, while growth in time deposits was attributable to the current interest rate environment and offering competitive interest rates to attract deposits. Estimated gross uninsured deposits at June 30, 2024 were $1.72 billion. This total includes fully collateralized uninsured governmental deposits and intercompany deposits of $886.8 million, leaving estimated uninsured deposits of approximately $835.3 million, or 22.0%, of total deposits. At December 31, 2023, estimated uninsured deposits totaled $869.9 million, or 22.4% of total deposits.\n\nDeposit account balances are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nTransaction:  \nNon-interest bearing checking| $| 685,574| $| 693,671| $| 694,903  \nNegotiable orders of withdrawal and interest-bearing checking| 1,251,342| 1,277,161| 1,231,943  \nTotal transaction| 1,936,916| 1,970,832| 1,926,846  \nSavings and money market:  \nSavings| 916,598| 930,766| 925,744  \nMoney market| 255,550| 266,464| 302,122  \nBrokered money market| —| —| 50,000  \nTotal savings| 1,172,148| 1,197,230| 1,277,866  \nCertificates of deposit:  \n$250,000 and under| 568,809| 546,192| 525,454  \nOver $250,000| 120,601| 108,358| 98,269  \nBrokered deposits| —| 98,711| 50,000  \nTotal certificates of deposit| 689,410| 753,261| 673,723  \nTotal deposits| $| 3,798,474| $| 3,921,323| $| 3,878,435  \n  \nIncluded in the table above are business and municipal deposit account balances as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nBusiness customers| $| 866,403| $| 870,004| $| 893,296  \nMunicipal (governmental) customers| $| 815,086| $| 827,468| $| 768,556  \n  \nBorrowed funds increased to $1.15 billion at June 30, 2024, from $920.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in borrowings for the period was primarily due to a $205.5 million increase in borrowings under the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program which included favorable terms and conditions as compared to FHLB advances. Management utilizes borrowings to mitigate interest rate risk, for short-term liquidity, and to a lesser extent from time to time, as part of leverage strategies.\n\nThe following table sets forth borrowing maturities (excluding overnight borrowings and subordinated debt) and the weighted average rate by year at June 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n\n**Year**| **Amount(1)**| **Weighted Average Rate**  \n---|---|---  \n2024| $50,765| 4.67%  \n2025| 482,500| 3.99%  \n2026| 148,000| 4.36%  \n2027| 173,000| 3.19%  \n2028| 154,288| 3.96%  \n$1,008,553| 3.94%  \n  \n(1)  Borrowings maturing in 2025 include $300.0 million of FRB borrowings that can be repaid without any penalty.\n\nTotal stockholders’ equity decreased by $6.4 million to $693.0 million at June 30, 2024, from $699.4 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was attributable to $11.7 million in stock repurchases and $11.1 million in dividend payments, partially offset by net income of $12.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a $3.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with an increase in the estimated fair value of our debt securities available-for-sale portfolio, and a $1.2 million increase in equity award activity. On April 24, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $5.0 million stock repurchase program which was completed in May 2024, and on June 14, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $10.0 million stock repurchase program. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.2 million of its common stock outstanding at an average price of $9.46 for a total of $11.7 million pursuant to the approved stock repurchase programs. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $6.3 million remaining capacity under its current repurchase program.\n\nThe Company's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, corporate bonds, and unpledged mortgage-related securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, that we can either borrow against or sell. We also have the ability to surrender bank-owned life insurance contracts. The surrender of these contracts would subject the Company to income taxes and penalties for increases in the cash surrender values over the original premium payments. We also have the ability to obtain additional funding from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of New York utilizing unencumbered and unpledged securities and multifamily loans. The Company expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current commitments in the normal course of business. The Company's on-hand liquidity ratio as of June 30, 2024 was 16.5%.\n\nThe Company had the following primary sources of liquidity at June 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): \n\nCash and cash equivalents (1)| $| 138,914  \n---|---|---  \nCorporate bonds (2)| $| 136,328  \nMultifamily loans (2)| $| 789,586  \nMortgage-backed securities (issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac)(2)| $| 485,416  \n  \n(1) Excludes $14.6 million of cash at Northfield Bank.(2) Represents estimated remaining borrowing potential. \n\nThe Company and the Bank utilize the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”) framework. The CBLR replaces the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rules. At June 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank's estimated CBLR ratios were 11.87% and 11.88%, respectively, which exceeded the minimum requirement to be considered well-capitalized of 9%. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe following table details total non-accrual loans (excluding PCD), non-performing assets, loans over 90 days delinquent on which interest is accruing, and accruing loans 30 to 89 days delinquent at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n\n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nNon-accrual loans:  \nHeld-for-investment  \nReal estate loans:  \nMultifamily| $| 2,691| $| 2,676| $| 2,709  \nCommercial| 10,244| 10,680| 6,491  \nOne-to-four family residential| 69| 101| 104  \nHome equity and lines of credit| 1,124| 1,125| 499  \nCommercial and industrial| 2,570| 2,200| 305  \nOther| 6| 6| 7  \n**Total non-accrual loans**|  16,704| 16,788| 10,115  \nLoans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing:  \nHeld-for-investment  \nReal estate loans:  \nMultifamily| —| 192| 201  \nOne-to-four family residential| 136| 137| 406  \nHome equity and lines of credit| 467| 124| 711  \nTotal loans held-for-investment delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing| 603| 453| 1,318  \n**Total non-performing assets**|  $| 17,307| $| 17,241| $| 11,433  \nNon-performing loans to total loans| 0.42| %| 0.41| %| 0.27| %  \nNon-performing assets to total assets| 0.30| %| 0.29| %| 0.20| %  \n**Accruing loans 30 to 89 days delinquent**|  $| 6,265| $| 8,266| $| 8,683  \n  \nThe increase in non-accrual commercial real estate loans from December 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to one loan with a balance of $4.4 million which was put on non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2024. Based on the results of the impairment analysis for this loan, no impairment reserve was necessary as the loan is adequately covered by collateral (a private residence and retail property, both located in New Jersey), with aggregate appraised values totaling $8.7 million. The increase in non-accrual commercial and industrial loans was primarily due to an increase in non-performing unsecured small business loans. Unsecured small business loans totaled $33.6 million and $37.4 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management continues to closely monitor the small business unsecured commercial and industrial loan portfolio.\n\nSubsequent to the quarter end, two non-accrual commercial real estate loans totaling approximately $1.6 million were paid-off.\n\nAccruing Loans 30 to 89 Days Delinquent\n\nLoans 30 to 89 days delinquent and on accrual status totaled $6.3 million, $8.3 million and $8.7 million at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following table sets forth delinquencies for accruing loans by type and by amount at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): \n\n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nHeld-for-investment  \nReal estate loans:  \nMultifamily| $| 168| $| 171| $| 740  \nCommercial| 1,557| 2,106| 1,010  \nOne-to-four family residential| 1,769| 1,171| 3,339  \nHome equity and lines of credit| 786| 1,029| 817  \nConstruction and land| —| 1,727| —  \nCommercial and industrial loans| 1,977| 2,062| 2,767  \nOther loans| 8| —| 10  \nTotal delinquent accruing loans held-for-investment| $| 6,265| $| 8,266| $| 8,683  \n  \nPCD Loans (Held-for-Investment)\n\nThe Company accounts for PCD loans at estimated fair value using discounted expected future cash flows deemed to be collectible on the date acquired. Based on its detailed review of PCD loans and experience in loan workouts, management believes it has a reasonable expectation about the amount and timing of future cash flows and accordingly has classified PCD loans ($9.3 million at June 30, 2024 and $9.9 million at December 31, 2023, respectively) as accruing, even though they may be contractually past due. At June 30, 2024, 6.9% of PCD loans were past due 30 to 89 days, and 15.6% were past due 90 days or more, as compared to 2.9% and 27.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\n\nOur multifamily loan portfolio at June 30, 2024 totaled $2.67 billion, or 65% of our total loan portfolio, of which $440.0 million, or 11%, included loans collateralized by properties in New York with units subject to some percentage of rent regulation.
