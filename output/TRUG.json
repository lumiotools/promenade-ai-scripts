Founded in 1982 as a subsidiary of Access Software, co-founded by our current CEO Christopher Jones, TruGolf has a rich history of revolutionizing the golf industry. After Access Software was acquired by Microsoft Corp in 1999, TruGolf emerged as an independent entity, bringing with it the core programming and graphics team that created Links LS 1999, one of the best-selling PC sports games of its time.\n\nToday, TruGolf is recognized as a leader in the golf simulator market, manufacturing and distributing cutting-edge software and hardware that redefines what is possible with golf technology. Our products are designed to capture the spirit of golf, blending tradition with modern innovation.\n\nAs a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ under the symbol TRUG, TruGolf is committed to advancing the game of golf. Our mission is to make golf more accessible, approachable, and affordable for players of all skill levels. By leveraging technology, we are not just building products—we are expanding the reach of the game, creating new opportunities for golfers everywhere, and inspiring the next generation to take up the sport.\n\nAt TruGolf, we believe in the power of golf to bring people together, and we remain passionate about driving the industry forward through innovation and creativity. Join us in shaping the future of golf.\n\n[ Know More ](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TruGolf-Presentation.pdf)\n\n![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/video-image.webp)\n\n[ ![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/icon-golf-1.png) ](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TruGolf-Presentation.pdf)\n\n[Investor](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TruGolf-Presentation.pdf) [Presentation](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TruGolf-Presentation.pdf)\n\n[ ![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/icon-golf-1.png) ](https://ir.trugolf.com/events-presentations/)\n\n[Upcoming](https://ir.trugolf.com/events-presentations/)\n\nEvents\n\n[ ![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/icon-golf-1.png) ](https://ir.trugolf.com/governance-documents/)\n\n[Governance Documents](https://ir.trugolf.com/governance-documents/)\n\n[ ![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/icon-golf-1.png) ](https://ir.trugolf.com/press-releases/)\n\n[News](https://ir.trugolf.com/press-releases/)\n\nReleases\n\n[ ![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/icon-golf-1.png) ](https://ir.trugolf.com/sec-filings/)\n\n[SEC](https://ir.trugolf.com/sec-filings/) Filings \n\n[ ![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/icon-golf-1.png) ](https://ir.trugolf.com/investor-alerts/)\n\n[Contact Investor](https://ir.trugolf.com/investor-alerts/)\n\nRelations\n\n## Sign Up For Email Alerts\n\n## Receive updates straight into your inbox\n\n[ SIGN UP TODAY ](https://ir.trugolf.com/investor-alerts/)\n\n[ ![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Footer-logo.webp) ](https://trugolf.com/)\n\nOur team has built award-winning video games(LINKS), innovative hardware soutions and now an all-new eSports platform to connect golfers around the world with E6 CONNECT \n\n## Quick Links\n\n![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/footer-title-unline.png)\n\n  * [ Stock Data ](https://ir.trugolf.com/stock-data/)\n  * [ Events & Presentation ](https://ir.trugolf.com/events-presentations/)\n  * [ SEC Filings ](https://ir.trugolf.com/sec-filings/)\n  * [ Board Committees ](https://ir.trugolf.com/board-committees/)\n  * [ Investor Alerts ](https://ir.trugolf.com/investor-alerts/)\n\n\n\n## Get in Touch with us\n\n![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/footer-title-unline.png)\n\n  * [ Investors: (917) 886-9071 ](tel:\\(917\\)%20886-9071)\n  * [ (866) 824-6672 ](tel:\\(866\\)%20824-6672)\n  * investors@trugolf.com\n  * media@trugolf.com\n  * 60 N 1400 W, Centerville, UT 84014\n\n\n\n## Follow\n\n![](https://ir.trugolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/footer-title-unline.png)\n\n  * [ ](https://twitter.com/TruGolfSim)\n  * [ ](https://www.facebook.com/TruGolfSimulators/)\n  * [ ](https://vimeo.com/trugolfsimulators)\n  * [ ](https://www.youtube.com/user/trugolf)\n  * [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trugolf/)\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2023.
