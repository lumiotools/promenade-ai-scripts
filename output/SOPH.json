This innovative solution provides organizations worldwide with the opportunity to benefit from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK)'s best-in-class comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) application on the SOPHiA DDM™ Platform with high accuracy and efficiency.\n\n[ ![SOPHiA GENETICS Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/SOPHiA GENETICS\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1673202/SOPHiA_GENETICS_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1673202/SOPHiA_GENETICS_Logo.html)\n\n\"The launch of MSK-IMPACT® powered with SOPHiA DDM™ is another major milestone in our journey to expand access to precision oncology globally and demonstrates our commitment to democratizing data-driven medicine,\" said Philippe Menu, M.D., PhD., Chief Product Officer and Chief Medical Officer, SOPHiA GENETICS. \"Following the successful launch of MSK-ACCESS® powered with SOPHiA DDM™ earlier this year, we are incredibly excited to further build on our excellent collaboration with MSK. Launching this application is a powerful step in our vision to decentralize access to advanced tumor profiling technologies, making these capabilities more widely available, especially in underserved populations.\"\n\nKojo S. J. Elenitoba-Johnson, M.D., Chair of the Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine at MSK, added, \"We share a vision with SOPHiA GENETICS to advance precision medicine and to make our leading tests more accessible to patients around the world.\"\n\nThrough MSK-IMPACT® powered with SOPHiA DDM™, organizations can process more precise oncology analysis by enhancing the accuracy of somatic mutation detection, including in genes that are highly relevant for the current pharmaceutical industry R&D pipelines, such as _MTAP_. The matched tumor-normal analysis approach allows clinicians and researchers to detect somatic mutations more confidently, minimizing the risk of misclassifying germline variants as tumor-specific. Additionally, institutions benefit from the global collective intelligence created by SOPHiA GENETICS' network, allowing users to contribute to and draw from a continuously evolving base of real-world data and insights from diverse populations.\n\nSOFIVA GENOMICS, a leading molecular diagnostics company in Taiwan, is among the first to adopt this application. The company initially partnered with SOPHiA GENETICS in 2022 to utilize the SOPHiA DDM™ Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) Solution. Now, SOFIVA GENOMICS is expanding its tumor profiling capabilities by adding MSK-IMPACT® powered with SOPHiA DDM™ alongside the liquid biopsy test MSK-ACCESS® powered with SOPHiA DDM™. \n\nChia-Cheng Hung, General Manager, SOFIVA GENOMICS, commented, \"Our partnership with SOPHiA GENETICS has greatly enhanced our ability to provide localized, highly accurate genomic testing. Access to this advanced technology enables us to bring advanced, trusted capabilities and further our progress on cancer research in Taiwan.\"\n\nMSK-IMPACT® powered with SOPHiA DDM™ enables a more efficient workflow, with the entire process from DNA extraction to final report taking approximately five days. Clinicians and researchers benefit from access to OncoKB™, MSK's Precision Oncology Knowledge Base, which further enhances the interpretive power of the SOPHiA DDM™ analysis through data-driven, actionable insights. In-house analytical validation results for MSK-IMPACT® powered with SOPHiA DDM™ showed high concordance to the single-site MSK-IMPACT® test, achieving:\n\n  * 99.3% positive percent agreement (PPA) for SNV/Indel detection\n  * 94.6% PPA for copy number variant (CNV) detection\n  * 99.4% overall percent agreement (OPA) for microsatellite instability (MSI) detection\n  * 98.8% OPA for tumor mutational burden (TMB) detection.\n\n\n\nFor more information on SOPHiA GENETICS, visit [SOPHiAGENETICS.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4308338-1&h=202194495&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sophiagenetics.com%2F&a=SOPHiAGENETICS.com), or connect on [LinkedIn](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4308338-1&h=3504641119&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fsophiagenetics%2F&a=LinkedIn).\n\n**About SOPHiA GENETICS** SOPHiA GENETICS (Nasdaq: SOPH) is a cloud-native healthcare technology company on a mission to transform patient care by expanding access to data-driven medicine globally.

I am proud of our ability to deliver strong new business momentum, while also excelling at cost management. In Q3, we expanded adjusted gross margins to 73.1% and improved cash burn significantly by 39% year-over-year to $9.6 million, while also strengthening commercial teams and customer-facing operations.\"\n\nCamblong added, \"Looking ahead, I'm excited by major growth catalysts such as our new Liquid Biopsy application MSK ACCESS® powered with SOPHiA DDMTM, which has already attracted an impressive 18 new customers since its launch in Q2. I am also excited by the recent launch of the application's Solid Tumor testing counterpart, MSK-IMPACT® powered with SOPHiA DDMTM.

The call will be webcast live on the SOPHiA GENETICS Investor Relations website, ir.sophiagenetics.com. Additionally, an audio replay of the conference call will be available on the SOPHiA GENETICS website after its completion.\n\n**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**\n\nOther than with respect to revenue, the Company only provides guidance on a non-IFRS basis. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted gross margin (non-IFRS measure) to gross margin (the most comparable IFRS financial measure), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying amortization of capitalized research & development expenses that are necessary for such reconciliation. In addition, the Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted operating loss (non-IFRS measure) to operating loss (the most comparable IFRS financial measure), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying amortization of capitalized research & development expenses and intangible assets, share-based compensation expenses, and non-cash portion of pensions paid in excess of actual contributions, that are necessary for such reconciliation.\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding the company's financial results, SOPHiA GENETICS has disclosed here and elsewhere in this earnings release the following non-IFRS measures:\n\n  * Adjusted gross profit, which the company calculates as revenue minus cost of revenue adjusted to exclude amortization of capitalized research and development expenses;\n  * Adjusted gross profit margin, which the company calculates as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue;\n  * Adjusted operating loss, which the company calculates as operating loss adjusted to exclude amortization of capitalized research and development expenses, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, and non-cash portion of pensions expense paid in excess of actual contributions to match the actuarial expense.\n\n\n\nThese non-IFRS measures are key measures used by SOPHiA GENETICS management and board of directors to evaluate its operating performance and generate future operating plans. The exclusion of certain expenses facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses and certain variable charges. Accordingly, the company believes that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors.\n\nThese non-IFRS measures have limitations as financial measures, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of SOPHiA GENETICS' results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * These non-IFRS measures exclude the impact of amortization of capitalized research and development expenses and intangible assets. Although amortization is a non-cash charge, the assets being amortized may need to be replaced in the future and these non-IFRS measures do not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures;\n  * These non-IFRS measures exclude the impact of share-based compensation expenses. Share-based compensation has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a recurring expense in the company's business and an important part of its compensation strategy;\n  * These non-IFRS measures exclude the impact of the non-cash portion of pensions paid in excess of actual contributions to match actuarial expenses. Pension expenses have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a recurring expense in the business; and\n  * Other companies, including companies in the company's industry, may calculate these non-IFRS measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\n\n\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider these non-IFRS measures alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income and other IFRS results.\n\nThe tables below provide the reconciliation of the most comparable IFRS measures to the non-IFRS measures for the periods presented.\n\n**Presentation of Constant Currency Revenue and Excluding COVID-19-Related Revenue**\n\nSOPHiA GENETICS operates internationally, and its revenues are generated primarily in the U.S. dollar, the euro and Swiss franc and, to a lesser extent, British pound, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Turkish lira and Canadian dollar depending on the company's customers' geographic locations. Changes in revenue include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present the non-IFRS financial measure \"constant currency revenue\" (or similar terms such as constant currency revenue growth) to show changes in revenue without giving effect to period-to-period currency fluctuations. Under IFRS, revenues received in local (non-U.S. dollar) currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the average monthly exchange rate for the month in which the transaction occurred. When the company uses the term \"constant currency\", it means that it has translated local currency revenues for the current reporting period into U.S. dollars using the same average foreign currency exchange rates for the conversion of revenues into U.S. dollars that we used to translate local currency revenues for the comparable reporting period of the prior year. The company then calculates the difference between the IFRS revenue and the constant currency revenue to yield the \"constant currency impact\" for the current period.\n\nThe company's management and board of directors use constant currency revenue growth to evaluate growth and generate future operating plans. The exclusion of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations provides comparability across reporting periods and reflects the effects of customer acquisition efforts and land-and-expand strategy. Accordingly, it believes that this non-IFRS measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating revenue growth in the same manner as the management and board of directors. However, this non-IFRS measure has limitations, particularly as the exchange rate effects that are eliminated could constitute a significant element of its revenue and could significantly impact performance and prospects. Because of these limitations, you should consider this non-IFRS measure alongside other financial performance measures, including revenue and revenue growth presented in accordance with IFRS and other IFRS results.\n\nIn addition to constant currency revenue, the company presents constant currency revenue excluding COVID-19-related revenue to further remove the effects of revenues that are derived from sales of COVID-19-related offerings, including a NGS assay for COVID-19 that leverages the SOPHiA DDMTM Platform and related products and solutions analytical capabilities and COVID-19 bundled access products. SOPHiA GENETICS do not believe that these revenues reflect its core business of commercializing its platform because the company's COVID-19 solution was offered to address specific market demand by its customers for analytical capabilities to assist with their testing operations. The company does not anticipate additional development of its COVID-19-related solution as the pandemic transitions into a more endemic phase and as customer demand continues to decline. Further, COVID-19-related revenues did not constitute, and the company does not expect COVID-19-related revenues to constitute in the future, a significant part of its revenue. Accordingly, the company believes that this non-IFRS measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its revenue growth. However, this non-IFRS measure has limitations, including that COVID-19-related revenues contributed to the company's cash position, and other companies may define COVID-19-related revenues differently. Because of these limitations, you should consider this non-IFRS measure alongside other financial performance measures, including revenue and revenue growth presented in accordance with IFRS and other IFRS results.\n\nThe table below provides the reconciliation of the most comparable IFRS growth measures to the non-IFRS growth measures for the current period.\n\n**About SOPHiA GENETICS**\n\nSOPHiA GENETICS (Nasdaq: SOPH) is a cloud-native healthcare technology company on a mission to expand access to data-driven medicine by using AI to deliver world-class care to patients with cancer and rare disorders across the globe.

(55,913)**  \n  \n**Notes to the Reconciliation of IFRS to Adjusted Financial Measures Tables**  \n---  \n(1) | Amortization of capitalized research and development expenses consists of software development costs amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated life of five years. These expenses do not have a cash impact but remain a recurring expense generated over the course of our research and development initiatives.  \n(2) | Amortization of intangible assets consists of costs related to intangible assets amortized over the course of their useful lives. These expenses do not have a cash impact, but we could continue to generate such expenses through future capital investments.  \n(3) | Share-based compensation expense represents the cost of equity awards issued to our directors, officers, and employees. The fair value of awards is computed at the time the award is granted and is recognized over the vesting period of the award by a charge to the income statement and a corresponding increase in other reserves within equity. These expenses do not have a cash impact but remain a recurring expense for our business and represent an important part of our overall compensation strategy.  \n(4) | Non-cash pension expense consists of the amount recognized in excess of actual contributions made to our defined pension plans to match actuarial expenses calculated for IFRS purposes. The difference represents a non-cash expense but remains a recurring expense for our business as we continue to make contributions to our plans for the foreseeable future.  \n(5) | Costs associated with restructuring consists of compensation paid to employees during their garden leave period, severance, and any other amounts legally owed to the employees resulting from their termination as part of a planned workforce reduction, which we undertook to optimize our operations. Additionally, it includes any legal fees incurred as part of the restructuring process. While such actions are not planned going forward as part of our regular operations, we expect such expenses could still be incurred from time to time based on corporate needs.  \n  \nSOURCE SOPHiA GENETICS\n\nFor further information: Investor Contact: Kellen Sanger, IR@sophiagenetics.com; Media Contact: Kelly Katapodis, media@sophiagenetics.com\n\n  * [Open a printable version of this page](#print \"Open a printable version of this page\")\n  * [Email the URL of this page to a friend](#email \"Email the URL of this page to a friend\")\n  * [Get the RSS feed for this page](https://ir.sophiagenetics.com/index.php?s=95&rsspage=43 \"Get the RSS feed for this page\")\n  * [Download a PDF version of this page](https://ir.sophiagenetics.com/2024-11-05-SOPHiA-GENETICS-Reports-Third-Quarter-2024-Results?asPDF=1 \"Download a PDF version of this page\")\n  * [ Share this page on Twitter ](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.sophiagenetics.com%2Findex.php%3Fs%3D43%26item%3D106 \"Twitter Share\")\n  * [ Share this page on LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.sophiagenetics.com%2Findex.php%3Fs%3D43%26item%3D106 \"Linkedin Share\")\n  * [ Share this page on Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.sophiagenetics.com%2Findex.php%3Fs%3D43%26item%3D106 \"Facebook Share\")\n\n\n\nEmail Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address.
