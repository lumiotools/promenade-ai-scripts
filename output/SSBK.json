(NASDAQ: SSBK) (“Southern States” or the “Company”), the holding company for Southern States Bank, an Alabama state-chartered commercial bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $7.4 million, or $0.76 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to net income of $8.2 million, or $0.90 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and net income of $6.6 million, or $0.73 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023. The Company reported core net income of $8.7 million, or $0.89 diluted core earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to core net income of $9.1 million, or $1.00 diluted core earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and core net income of $9.6 million, or $1.06 diluted core earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023 (see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).\n\n**CEO Commentary**\n\n_Mark Chambers, Chief Executive Officer and President of Southern States said, “The top highlight of our third quarter was the completion of the CBB Bancorp acquisition on August 1 as planned. I want to welcome our new colleagues who contributed to a seamless integration between two organizations that share a common culture. Our combination with Century Bank has strengthened our platform to drive loan and deposit growth across growing and attractive Georgia markets.”_  \n---  \n _“Net interest income for the third quarter increased more than 12.4% to $24.2 million for the quarter largely reflecting the contribution from Century Bank. Net interest margin also increased 9 basis points to 3.65% from 3.56% quarter-over-quarter, which further reflects Century Bank’s contribution.”_  \n _“Finally, we were pleased to be recognized in Piper Sandler’s Sm-All Stars: Class of 2024 for the third year in a row. The Sm-All Stars’ objective is to identify the top performing U.S. small-cap banks and thrifts based on growth, profitability, credit quality, and capital strength. Our objective is to run a highly efficient bank, consistently deliver the highest level of customer satisfaction and increase value for our shareholders.”_  \n  \n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **% Change****September 30, 2024****vs.**  \n**September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n _(Dollars in thousands)_  \nAverage interest-earning assets| $| 2,645,388| $| 2,440,425| $| 2,175,103| 8.4| %| 21.6| %  \nNet interest income| $| 24,246| $| 21,579| $| 20,731| 12.4| %| 17.0| %  \nNet interest margin| 3.65| %| 3.56| %| 3.78| %| 9 bps| (13) bps  \n  \nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $24.2 million, an increase of 12.4% from $21.6 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was substantially due to the acquisition of Century Bank.\n\nRelative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest income increased $3.5 million, or 17.0%. The increase was mainly driven by significant growth, partially as a result of the acquisition of Century Bank, which offset the decline in net interest margin.\n\nNet interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.65%, compared to 3.56% for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to a slight increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, coupled with a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. The acquisition of Century Bank had a positive impact and helped lift the margin for third quarter of 2024.\n\nRelative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest margin decreased from 3.78%. The decrease was primarily the result of the increase in interest rates, which accelerated the cost of interest-bearing liabilities at a greater pace than the yield received on interest-earning assets. The acquisition of Century Bank resulted in a positive impact to the net interest margin, effectively helping to reduce the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n**Noninterest Income**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **% Change****September 30, 2024****vs.**  \n**September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n _(Dollars in thousands)_  \nService charges on deposit accounts| $| 532| $| 462| $| 442| 15.2| %| 20.4| %  \nSwap (expense) fees| (9| )| 4| 453| 325.0| %| 102.0| %  \nSBA/USDA fees| 179| 58| 74| 208.6| %| 141.9| %  \nMortgage origination fees| 112| 92| 158| 21.7| %| (29.1| )%  \nNet gain (loss) on securities| 75| 20| (12| )| 275.0| %| 725.0| %  \nEmployee retention credit and related revenue (“ERC”)| —| —| (5,100| )| N/A| N/A  \nOther operating income| 868| 732| 1,091| 18.6| %| (20.4| )%  \nTotal noninterest income| $| 1,757| $| 1,368| $| (2,894| )| 28.4| %| 160.7| %  \n  \nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.8 million, an increase of 28.4% from $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2024. The acquisition of Century Bank on July 31, 2024 resulted in additional noninterest income during the third quarter of 2024. Apart from the acquisition, the increase was also due to increased SBA/USDA fees primarily resulting from the sales of loans during the third quarter of 2024, along with a larger realized net gain on securities during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRelative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest income increased 160.7% from a noninterest net expense of $2.9 million. The third quarter of 2023 included a $5.1 million payment to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the return of the ERC, which was received during the second quarter of 2023. The IRS revised eligibility guidelines during the third quarter of 2023, and the Company applied for the Voluntary Disclosure Program and removed this from income and recorded a payable. The acquisition of Century Bank on July 31, 2024 resulted in additional noninterest income during the third quarter of 2024. The increase was partially offset by a decline in swap fees during the third quarter of 2024, substantially as a result of the Company not participating in any swap transactions.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **% Change****September 30, 2024****vs.**  \n**September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n _(Dollars in thousands)_  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 6,876| $| 6,112| $| 5,752| 12.5| %| 19.5| %  \nEquipment and occupancy expenses| 814| 667| 718| 22.0| %| 13.4| %  \nData processing fees| 781| 686| 650| 13.8| %| 20.2| %  \nRegulatory assessments| 414| 375| 322| 10.4| %| 28.6| %  \nProfessional fees related to ERC| —| —| (1,243| )| N/A| N/A  \nMerger-related expenses| 1,511| —| —| N/A| N/A  \nOther operating expenses| 3,291| 3,571| 2,370| (7.8| )%| 38.9| %  \nTotal noninterest expenses| $| 13,687| $| 11,411| $| 8,569| 19.9| %| 59.7| %  \n  \nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $13.7 million, an increase of 19.9% from $11.4 million in the second quarter of 2024. The acquisition of Century Bank on July 31, 2024 resulted in merger-related expenses of $1.5 million, of which $961,000 was not deductible for taxes. Also there were additional noninterest expenses related to Century Bank during the third quarter of 2024, primarily in salaries and employee benefits. The acquisition also gave rise to a $106,000 increase in amortization expense associated with the core deposit intangible. Also included in the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $250,000 in expenses associated with calling brokered deposits and collection expenses related to a problem loan.\n\nRelative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest expense increased 59.7% from $8.6 million. The acquisition of Century Bank on July 31, 2024 resulted in merger-related expenses of $1.5 million, along with additional noninterest expense during the third quarter of 2024. Salaries and employee benefits increased as a result of the acquisition and from a legacy standpoint. The third quarter of 2023 included a $1.2 million refund of professional fees related to the aforementioned return of ERC.\n\n**Loans and Credit Quality**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **% Change****September 30, 2024****vs.**  \n**September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n _(Dollars in thousands)_  \nGross loans| $| 2,205,747| $| 2,021,877| $| 1,779,846| 9.1| %| 23.9| %  \nUnearned income| (6,536| )| (6,443| )| (5,698| )| 1.4| %| 14.7| %  \nLoans, net of unearned income (“Loans”)| 2,199,211| 2,015,434| 1,774,148| 9.1| %| 24.0| %  \nAverage loans, net of unearned (“Average loans”)| $| 2,134,318| $| 1,987,533| $| 1,740,582| 7.4| %| 22.6| %  \nNonperforming loans (“NPL”)| $| 7,868| $| 3,784| $| 1,082| 107.9| %| 627.2| %  \nProvision for credit losses| $| 2,583| $| 1,067| $| 773| 142.1| %| 234.2| %  \nAllowance for credit losses (“ACL”)| $| 28,061| $| 25,828| $| 22,181| 8.6| %| 26.5| %  \nNet charge-offs (recoveries)| $| 350| $| 383| $| (23| )| (8.6| )%| 1621.7| %  \nNPL to gross loans| 0.36| %| 0.19| %| 0.06| %  \nNet charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans(1)| 0.07| %| 0.08| %| (0.01| )%  \nACL to loans| 1.28| %| 1.28| %| 1.25| %  \n(1) Ratio is annualized.  \n  \nLoans, net of unearned income, were $2.2 billion at September 30, 2024, up $183.8 million from June 30, 2024 and up $425.1 million from September 30, 2023. The acquisition of Century Bank resulted in additional loans of $131.7 million at September 30, 2024. Apart from the acquired loans, the linked-quarter increase in loans was primarily attributable to new business growth across our footprint.\n\nNonperforming loans totaled $7.9 million, or 0.36% of gross loans, at September 30, 2024, compared with $3.8 million, or 0.19% of gross loans, at June 30, 2024, and $1.1 million, or 0.06% of gross loans, at September 30, 2023. The $4.1 million net increase in nonperforming loans in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to a significant commercial and industrial loan that was added to nonaccrual status and partially offset by a commercial and industrial loan that was charged-off. The $6.8 million net increase in nonperforming loans from September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to one significant commercial and industrial loan, another less significant commercial and industrial loan and one commercial real estate loan that were added to nonaccrual status. Significant collection efforts have been made on the large commercial and industrial loan and no loss is anticipated.\n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2024. Provision in the third quarter of 2024 included a “Day 2” $1.7 million provision as a result of the acquisition as well as additional provisions based on growth.\n\nNet charge-offs for the third quarter of 2024 were $350,000, or 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis, compared to net charge-offs of $383,000, or 0.08% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the second quarter of 2024, and net recoveries of $23,000, or (0.01)% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2023. The charge-offs recorded during the second and third quarters of 2024 were substantially related to a purchased pool of consumer loans for which the borrower filed for bankruptcy. The loan was fully charged-off as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses was 1.28% of total loans and 356.65% of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.28% of total loans and 682.56% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024. Allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $1.4 million at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Deposits**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **% Change****September 30, 2024****vs.**  \n**September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n _(Dollars in thousands)_  \nNoninterest-bearing deposits| $| 546,282| $| 416,068| $| 418,125| 31.3| %| 30.7| %  \nInterest-bearing deposits| 1,874,264| 1,759,610| 1,498,276| 6.5| %| 25.1| %  \nTotal deposits| $| 2,420,546| $| 2,175,678| $| 1,916,401| 11.3| %| 26.3| %  \nUninsured deposits| $| 964,528| $| 645,283| $| 568,323| 49.5| %| 69.7| %  \nUninsured deposits to total deposits| 39.85| %| 29.66| %| 29.66| %  \nNoninterest deposits to total deposits| 22.57| %| 19.12| %| 21.82| %  \n  \nTotal deposits were $2.4 billion at September 30, 2024, up from $2.2 billion at June 30, 2024 and $1.9 billion at September 30, 2023. The $244.9 million increase in total deposits in the third quarter was due to an increase of $130.2 million in noninterest-bearing deposits and a $114.7 million increase in interest-bearing deposits. The acquisition of Century Bank resulted in additional deposits of $304.4 million at September 30, 2024, or $183.4 million in interest-bearing deposits, none of which were brokered deposits, and $121.0 million in noninterest-bearing deposits. Total brokered deposits were $194.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $288.3 million at June 30, 2024. The Company used cash from the acquisition of Century Bank to call $52.3 million of brokered deposits, while another $41.9 million matured and were repaid.\n\n**Capital**  \n---  \n**September 30,****2024**| **June 30,****2024**| **September 30,****2023**  \n**Company**| **Bank**| **Company**| **Bank**| **Company**| **Bank**  \nTier 1 capital ratio to average assets| 8.64| %| 11.48| %| 8.72| %| 11.52| %| 8.70| %| 11.71| %  \nRisk-based capital ratios:  \nCommon equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio| 9.36| %| 12.43| %| 9.54| %| 12.61| %| 9.32| %| 12.55| %  \nTier 1 capital ratio| 9.36| %| 12.43| %| 9.54| %| 12.61| %| 9.32| %| 12.55| %  \nTotal capital ratio| 14.18| %| 13.59| %| 14.50| %| 13.77| %| 14.60| %| 13.67| %  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, total stockholders’ equity was $271.4 million, up from $230.6 million at June 30, 2024.

Such statements include, without limitation, statements relating to the impact Southern States expects the merger to have on the combined entities’ operations, financial condition, and financial results, and other benefits Southern States expects to realize as a result of the merger. Forward-looking statements also include, without limitation, predictions or expectations of future business or financial performance as well as Southern States’ goals and objectives for future operations, financial and business trends, business prospects, and management’s outlook or expectations for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital levels, liquidity levels, asset quality or other future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements often, but not always, are preceded by, are followed by or otherwise include the words such as “may,” “can,” “should,” “could,” “to be,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “likely,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “project,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other similar words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the banking industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. This may be especially true given recent events and trends in the banking industry and interest rate volatility. Although Southern States believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the dates made, it cannot give any assurance that such expectations will prove correct and actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Southern States; the risk that the businesses of Southern States and CBB Bancorp will not be integrated successfully; the possibility that the cost savings and any synergies or other anticipated benefits from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers or other parties with whom Southern States or CBB Bancorp have business relationships; diversion of management time on merger-related issues; risks relating to the potential dilutive effect of the shares of Southern States common stock issued in the merger; the reaction to the merger of the companies’ customers, employees and counterparties; and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Southern States. For additional information, refer to the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of Southern States’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Southern States’ Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings, which have been filed by Southern States with the SEC and are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. You should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included herein are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to herein. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, and whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as specifically required by law.\n\n**Contact Information**\n\nLynn Joyce(205) 820-8065 [ljoyce@ssbank.bank](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-Ew6rn7KFOupisjrSo6ftK4Mk-go447GWh0z8v5C_FG89UnxI4c3w0U8IBSu6hNQi056bQOz0uVQ75t4HnMo9qQLlgVkkw2ZiLWGkeQ09lM=)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/Zjg1NWY0NWUtNDMxNy00YmRlLWE3N2UtNzNjNGFiNzI5MjUyLTEyMjE2NTM=/tiny/Southern-States-Bancshares-Inc.png)\n"
