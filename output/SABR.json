Building on promising results from its pilot phase, the professional grade, user-friendly interface provides agents with easy access to AI-powered capabilities and multi-source content, without the need for deep Global Distribution System expertise.\n\nSabre Red Launchpad supports air (traditional, New Distribution Capability, low-cost carrier), hotel and car content. Designed as an extension of Sabre’s flagship interface Sabre Red 360™, Sabre Red Launchpad™ eliminates the complexity of creating and managing travel reservations while introducing new consumer grade shopping experiences. By minimizing training time, Sabre Red Launchpad empowers travel consultants to begin earning commissions faster by unlocking multi-source content available in Sabre’s marketplace.\n\nLaunch partner Internova Travel Group released Internova SNAP, a custom version of Sabre Red Launchpad, to thousands of US-based advisors earlier this year. As of October, over 300 agencies and 13,000 advisors are now using SNAP, driving an increase in overall sales volume. SNAP also provides access to hotel and car content from Internova Travel Group company Travel Leaders Network (TLN), providing additional options for agents and their travelers.\n\n**Peter Vlitas, Executive Vice President, Partner Relations at Internova Travel Group,** said, “We needed a solution for advisors who were not using a GDS but wanted to enhance client service and unlock new revenue opportunities. By collaborating closely with our extensive distribution team, Sabre developed this intuitive booking tool, empowering our agents to not only thrive in modern airline retailing but also make more money.”\n\n**Kathy Morgan, Senior Vice President of Product Management, Distribution Experience, Sabre Travel Solutions,** said, “By listening closely to our customers and analyzing changes in the travel landscape, we realized there were unmet needs in the market. Sabre Red Launchpad addresses those needs, making it easier to tap into Sabre’s extensive and multi-source travel content and generate revenue from day one. We’re thrilled to now offer Sabre Red Launchpad™ globally to support travel agency customers of all sizes.”\n\n**Chinmai Sharma, Global Head – Lodging, Ground & Sea at Sabre Travel Solutions, **said, “For lodging, Sabre Red Launchpad utilizes machine learning to analyze property attributes, trip segmentation, and preferences to present the most relevant lodging options, boosting hotel attachment rates and offering personalized choices.”\n\nMeanwhile, early adopter 1000 Mile Travel Group (1000MTG) worked closely with Sabre to create 1000Access with Sabre Red Launchpad technology. 1000Access enables the group’s independent travel advisors to search, shop and book, air, hotel, and car content all in one place complete with automated fulfillment. \n\n**Ben Ross, Co-Founder and CEO 1000MTG, said, “** Within six months of soft launch, 40 percent of North American advisors were onboarded to 1000Access, collectively earning over $120,000USD in airline commissions– and this is only the beginning. Our goal is to save our travel advisor’s time whilst providing an avenue to make more money and not leave anything on the table. Because we found a solution for our network, 1000MTG has had vast interest from peers in the industry who face the same problem and want the same solution and have been awarded air fulfilment partner status with Global Luxury Network Virtuoso.”\n\n**Morgan added,** “Sabre Red Launchpad is another proof point of Sabre’s commitment to product innovation and customer collaboration that delivers value to suppliers and buyers of travel. We are demonstrating Sabre’s innovation in action–in three months, we went from concept to working code. Collaboration is part of our DNA. Our innovation accelerates your progress.”\n\n###\n\n**About Sabre Corporation**\n\nSabre Corporation is a leading software and technology company that powers the global travel industry, serving a wide range of travel companies including airlines, hoteliers, travel agencies and other suppliers.

Sabre’s NDC capabilities, a core component of its multi-source content platform, will provide agencies with rich content and real-time offers from Air India, ultimately, giving travelers greater transparency, choice, and flexibility. \n\nNipun Aggarwal, Chief Commercial Officer, Air India, said: “At Air India, our aim is to deliver superior customer service through innovative technologies. By continuing to enhance our partnership with Sabre, we’re able to advance our NDC journey to meet the evolving needs of travel agencies and passengers, providing an enhanced experience.” \n\nSabre and Air India already have an agreement in place to distribute Air India’s traditional content, both in India and globally. With the launch of NDC offers through Sabre, Air India aims to further optimize its distribution strategy, providing travel agencies with a broader range of real-time offers. By using Sabre’s technology, the airline will be able to offer a more streamlined, efficient shopping experience that meets the dynamic needs of the modern traveller. \n\n“We’re energized to extend our collaboration with Air India by launching their NDC content and helping to enhance their distribution capabilities,” said Kathy Morgan, Senior Vice President of Product Management, Distribution Experience, Sabre Travel Solutions. “India is a key market for Sabre and for the travel industry overall as it fuels increased demand for travel. It’s important that the airline can distribute its NDC content easily to third party sellers and, in turn, that travel agencies can shop, compare, book and service multiple types of air content to provide the travellers they serve with a compelling experience.” \n\nThousands of Sabre-connected agencies in more than 150 countries around the world are already shopping, booking, and servicing NDC content through Sabre’s global travel marketplace. \n\n### \n\n**About Sabre Corporation**\n\nSabre Corporation is a software and technology company that takes on the biggest opportunities and solves the most complex challenges in travel.

This modern approach gives property and chain-level administrators access to performance metrics, significantly reduces manual effort, and eliminates the need for individual hotels to rely on central chains to share this information. By putting data directly in the hands of hoteliers, SynXis Insights enables faster, more informed decision-making and the implementation of data-driven, [revenue-generating](https://www.sabrehospitality.com/strategies-to-increase-hotel-revenue/) strategies. \n\n“The launch of SynXis Insights marks a significant milestone in our commitment to providing our customers with better reporting and data,” said Scott Wilson, President of Sabre Hospitality. “We are enabling our customers to make informed decisions that drive revenue and improve overall business performance.” \n\nSynXis Insights offers more than 15 filtering options, allowing users to compare data across previous years and focus on specific metrics such as bookings, room nights, revenue, or average daily rate (ADR). This flexibility ensures that hoteliers can tailor their analyses to meet their unique needs and objectives. \n\n“SynXis Insights provides HotelREZ with easy-to-interpret data, helping us drive informed decision-making, enhancing our operational efficiency and customer understanding,” said Jennifer Morgan, Director of Account Management, HotelREZ. “It is a welcome addition to our offering as we need information presented in a clear, concise way which we can easily digest and use for our strategic planning.”\n\nSynXis Insights, developed as part of Sabre’s strategic innovation partnership with Google, utilizes Google Cloud’s powerful data and analytics tools to provide visualizations of historical and forward-looking customer production from the SynXis platform. The tool integrates reservation data from SynXis Booking Engine, SynXis Voice Agent, Global Distribution System (GDS), and Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) via Channel Connect, offering six detailed dashboards: Channel Performance, Lead Time Insights, Performance Overview, Rate/Room Performance, Time of Booking Insights, and Travel Agent Performance.\n\n“We have invested significant time and resources into developing SynXis Insights in direct response to our customers’ needs,” said Hannah Garcia, Director of Product Management at Sabre Hospitality. “Through extensive user interviews and rapid concept development, we created a tool that provides great insights while also providing the security, stability, and scalability our customers expect. Our early adopter group, which includes renowned brands like HotelREZ, Hard Rock Hotels, and COHO Res, has provided invaluable feedback, ensuring that SynXis Insights is a robust and effective solution for the hospitality industry.” \n\nAs part of Sabre’s vision for 2025 and beyond, SynXis Insights will add reporting for customers who use Sabre’s GDS Media and Digital Marketing services, as well as enhanced reporting for SynXis Booking Engine. Further in the future, there are plans to integrate additional data sources and advanced analytic capabilities. This ongoing development underscores Sabre’s dedication to driving innovation and excellence in the hospitality industry. By providing comprehensive data analytics and reporting tools, Sabre enables its customers to discover [trends](https://www.sabrehospitality.com/hotel-marketing/) in business performance, optimize their distribution strategies, and [boost revenue](https://www.sabrehospitality.com/resources/article/top-10-strategies-to-increase-your-hotel-revenue-in-2024/). \n\nFor more information about SynXis Insights and how it can transform your hotel operations, please visit the [SynXis Insights page](https://www.sabrehospitality.com/studios/synxis-insights/) on our website. \n\n### \n\n**About Sabre Corporation**\n\nSabre Corporation is a software and technology company that takes on the biggest opportunities and solves the most complex challenges in travel.

By integrating advanced capabilities from leading technology companies into its hospitality solutions, Sabre Hospitality is not only meeting but exceeding the [evolving needs](https://www.sabrehospitality.com/hotel-marketing/) of its customers. \n\nSabre Hospitality’s approach to the ever-evolving demands of the hospitality industry is focused on empowering hoteliers to [achieve their goals](https://www.sabrehospitality.com/resources/article/top-10-strategies-to-increase-your-hotel-revenue-in-2024/) through innovative technology and seamless integrations. Rather than building every feature from scratch, Sabre Hospitality strategically partners with leading technology companies to incorporate their advanced capabilities into its solutions. This approach accelerates time-to-market and ensures that hoteliers have access to best-in-class tools that enhance the experience for their guests. \n\n“At Sabre, we are placing a high degree of emphasis on creating value for our hoteliers through strategic partnerships,” said Ron Reed, Head of Strategic Partnerships, Sabre Hospitality. “Executing on key partnerships is a great way to expand our product offerings with a faster pace and efficiency. We plan to introduce several new strategic partnerships in the coming months that will bring differentiated and innovative solutions designed to drive up conversions, increase the average order value and elevate the guest experience throughout the booking journey.” \n\nA prime example of this strategy is Sabre’s partnership with Upgrade Flex Pay (known previously as Uplift, which was acquired by Upgrade, Inc.). Upgrade Flex Pay provides flexible payment solutions in hospitality, retail and travel. Through this collaboration, Sabre Hospitality has enabled hotels using the SynXis Booking Engine to offer travelers the option of paying for their stays over time. \n\n“Strategic partnerships like the one we have with Sabre are critical to driving innovation and growth in the travel industry,” said Tom Botts, Head of Commercial, Flex Pay at Upgrade. “By working together, we’re able to provide flexible, guest-centric payment solutions that enhance the booking experience and support the evolving needs of both travelers and hoteliers.” \n\nSimilarly, Sabre’s partnership with Protect Group provides guests with trip protection guarantees, offering flexibility during the booking process leading up to their stay. This allows travelers to adjust or cancel their plans with confidence, knowing they are covered if a qualifying unforeseen circumstance disrupts their itinerary. This capability will be seamlessly integrated into the SynXis Booking Engine in 2025, allowing hotels to offer a valuable service without complicating the booking process. \n\n“In today’s rapidly evolving hospitality industry, strategic partnerships like the one we’ve established with Sabre are more than just a business necessity—they’re a shared commitment to innovation and enhancing the guest experience,” said Austin Lopez, Global Head of Hospitality, Protect Group. “By working closely together, we unlock new opportunities that benefit not only our companies but the entire ecosystem, driving growth and delivering greater value to our clients worldwide.” \n\nAdditionally, Sensible Weather, known for its Weather Guarantee services, has also joined forces with Sabre. “Partnering with Sabre allows us to bring our unique weather coverage directly to hoteliers and travelers,” said Nick Cavanaugh, CEO of Sensible Weather. “Through this partnership, Sabre’s hospitality clients can offer weather-related assurances to guests, providing peace of mind and fostering loyalty. This is a powerful way to improve the booking experience while addressing travelers’ concerns over weather disruptions.” \n\nSabre’s ability to integrate these diverse solutions into its platform is a reflection of its customer-centric approach. By listening to the needs of its customers and the broader market, Sabre Hospitality is ensuring that its booking engine remains at the forefront of industry innovation. This approach not only benefits hoteliers but also enhances the overall travel experience for millions of guests worldwide. \n\n“These integrations reflect Sabre Hospitality’s unwavering commitment to delivering innovative, guest-centric solutions that elevate the guest experience,” said Ethan Wiseman, Head of Distribution at Sabre Hospitality. “Our product roadmap is focused on providing industry-leading eCommerce retailing capabilities. By partnering with experts across industries, we can quickly add new capabilities, significantly accelerating our speed of execution and support [driving revenue](https://www.sabrehospitality.com/maximizing-hotel-revenue/) gains for our hoteliers.” \n\nAs Sabre Hospitality continues to build on these partnerships, the company is setting the stage for a future where seamless, technology-driven booking experiences are the norm. With more exciting developments on the horizon, Sabre Hospitality is poised to remain a key player in shaping the future of the hospitality industry. \n\n### \n\n**About Sabre Corporation** Sabre Corporation is a software and technology company that takes on the biggest opportunities and solves the most complex challenges in travel.

Just like Sabre who recently announced our revolutionary AI-centric airline retailing platform, [SabreMosaic](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic), Formula 1 is at the cutting edge of innovation and technology. Put your airline in pole position for retail transformation with these ‘intelligent’ strategies from the Formula 1 grid.\n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Mosaic_F1_Blog_June2024.webp)\n\nPublished on \n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/si2024-120x120.webp) Sabre Insights  on  November 11, 2024 \n\n  * [ Share on LinkedIn  ](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.sabre.com/insights/intelligent-retailing-lessons-from-the-formula-1-grid/&title=&source=LinkedIn \"Share this on Linkedin!\")\n  * [ Share on Facebook  ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.sabre.com/insights/intelligent-retailing-lessons-from-the-formula-1-grid/&t=Intelligent+airline+retailing%3A+Lessons+from+the+Formula+1+grid \"Share this on Facebook!\")\n  * [ Share on Twitter  ](https://twitter.com/home?status=Intelligent+airline+retailing%3A+Lessons+from+the+Formula+1+grid: https://www.sabre.com/insights/intelligent-retailing-lessons-from-the-formula-1-grid/ \"Share this on Twitter!\")\n  * [ Print page  ](javascript:window.print\\(\\); \"Print this page\")\n\n\n\n## **In this Article:**\n\n  * [Advanced data science ](#mercedes-amg-edge)\n  * [Experimentation](#red-bull-wings)\n  * [AI/ML to optimize across variables](#ferrari-ai)\n  * [AI/ML to optimize on the go ](#mc-laren-performance)\n\n\n\n**Watch the video for a quick explainer on SabreMosaic’s intelligence**\n\n## **Glitz, glamor and Google Cloud**\n\nLast month was the Monaco Grand Prix, arguably the most prestigious and glamorous Grand Prix location. For many racing drivers, taking the checkered flag in Monaco represents the pinnacle of sporting success. The iconic street circuit is incredibly demanding, with strategy and **intelligence** playing a vital role in deciding the outcome.\n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Mosaic_F1_Blog_Monaco_June224.webp)\n\nAt Sabre, we believe intelligence is a critical ingredient for airline retailing success, and we’ve infused AI into our [offer- and order-based retailing platform](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic), leveraging the enormous potential in areas such as:\n\n  * Advanced data science \n  * Experimentation \n  * AI/ML to optimize across variables \n  * AI/ML to optimize on the go \n\n\n\nFor airlines looking to boost their [retailing intelligence](https://www.sabre.com/products/suites/retail-intelligence/), we’ve got you covered. Our open, modular and [Google Cloud-native](https://www.sabre.com/insights/how-the-right-equipment-holds-the-key-to-optimal-performance/) tech platform provides the foundation for high-performance retailing – but it’s our integrated intelligence that really sets [SabreMosaic](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic) apart.\n\n**Data and analytics**\n\n## **How Mercedes-AMG finds a competitive edge**\n\nDuring Grand Prix races, the Mercedes-AMG team is bombarded with data from various sensors on their cars. AI and ML algorithms analyze this data in real time, providing insights into car performance, tire degradation and track conditions. This [rich data provides actionable insights](https://www.sabre.com/insights/how-data-helped-me-conquer-the-leadville-trail-100-mtb/) enabling the team to make intelligent decisions about fuel management, engine settings and pit stop strategies.\n\nSimilarly, [modern airline retailing](http://www.sabre.com/open) relies on data analytics to understand traveler behavior, preferences, and buying patterns, enabling airlines to tailor their services and offerings accordingly. [SabreMosaic](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic) utilizes Google Cloud’s BigQuery data warehouse which allows airlines to store, analyze and interrogate virtually unlimited volumes of data in such a way as to make it actionable. This data can then be consumed by Google’s best-in-class Vertex AI solution (as well as other non-Google tools) to build a comprehensive and accurate picture of travelers and present them with the most relevant content, increasing the likelihood of those offers converting into revenue-generating orders. \n\nAt Sabre, BigQuery and Vertex AI help power our [Retail Intelligence](https://www.sabre.com/retail-intelligence/) suite of products, which several of our [airline partners](https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/air-serbia-to-become-the-first-customer-of-sabres-ai-driven-product-air-price-iq/) are already using to create value for themselves and their passengers.\n\n**Intelligent experimentation**\n\n## **Red Bull gives you wings**\n\nSince the Red Bull team burst onto the Formula 1 scene less than two decades ago, they’ve succeeded in changing the landscape of Formula 1. They achieved this by challenging the status quo, experimenting and pushing technology to the limit. Their willingness to [experiment](https://www.sabre.com/insights/how-experimentation-delivers-results-for-athletes/) has paid dividends, winning them multiple driver and constructor championships in one of the most competitive sports environments.\n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Mosaic_F1_Blog_redbull_June2024.webp)\n\nRed Bull have proven to be dynamic, innovative and forward-thinking – everything the airline industry aspires to be as it [transforms towards modern retailing](http://www.sabre.com/open/airlines), breaking free from tradition in the process. Just as racing teams like Red Bull experiment with new and innovative car designs, so airlines can embrace [intelligent experimentation](https://www.sabre.com/insights/winner-winner-chicken-dinner/) to give their retailing capabilities ‘wings’.\n\nSabre’s experimentation engine, based on a type of AI/ML known as reinforcement learning, provides exciting opportunities for airlines and travel sellers. Experimentation engines do not rely on extensive historical data; instead, they try out multiple options and observe the outcomes. The models learn from those outcomes, adjust parameters as needed, and run the process again (and again, and again).\n\nAdvanced ML experimentation like this enables airlines using our modular [SabreMosaic](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic) platform to create contextualized offers for travelers, which increases the likelihood of conversion.\n\n**‘Forza ferrari’**\n\n## **Balancing speed and efficiency with the help of AI**\n\nIn Formula 1, speed matters. But it’s far from the only consideration when design teams are looking to optimize their race car. Ferrari employs cutting-edge AI when analyzing various configurations with different shapes, angles and internal structures. Through AI simulations, they can find the optimal design – one that maximizes straight-line speed while ensuring sufficient downforce to maintain grip when cornering.\n\nWhen looking to optimize offer conversion in a competitive retail environment, airlines must strike a similarly intelligent balance. Fractions of a second define the difference between conversions and abandoned searches. But the offers presented to travelers must also be relevant, personalized and contextualized to successfully convert into revenue-generating orders.\n\n[](https://www.sabre.com/insights/customer-success/air-serbia/)\n\n[Read Air Serbia’s success story](https://www.sabre.com/insights/customer-success/air-serbia/)\n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/air-serbia-large-transparent-1440x293.webp)\n\nAt Sabre, we’ve got you covered. We’ve partnered with [Google](https://www.sabre.com/insights/sabre-google-partnership/), whose global network has the highest throughput (fastest processing rate) available from any cloud vendor*. Our [Air Price IQ™](https://www.sabre.com/products/suites/retail-intelligence/air-price-iq/) product – created as a result of our strategic partnership with Google – delivers dynamic and intelligent airline pricing that could **increase air fare revenue opportunities by up to 3%**.\n\n_* 2021 Cockroach Labs Cloud Report_\n\n**McLaren**\n\n## **Using high-performance AI/ML computing to optimize performance**\n\nAs one of the oldest and most successful teams in Formula 1, McLaren understands the importance of embracing the latest technological advances when it comes to winning Grand Prix. AI/ML can play a critical role in analyzing the billions of potential configurations of a race car’s aerodynamic components. Throw other variables into the mix – race strategy, driver preferences, track configuration, weather conditions – and it’s easy to see the level of customization and personalization that’s required to stay competitive.\n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Mosaic_F1_Blog_racecar_June2024.webp)\n\nIn [airline retailing](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic), there is a growing emphasis on travel experiences that cater to individual customer needs. As the industry has shifted to selling more individual ancillaries and branded fare bundles, the opportunities for more [dynamic pricing](https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/sabre-introduces-retail-intelligence/) with AI/ML technology have grown.\n\nOur [Ancillary IQ™](https://www.sabre.com/products/suites/retail-intelligence/ancillary-iq/) product considers passenger, trip and marketplace insights to present personalized airline ancillary products and bundles that travelers are most likely to purchase. Embedded machine learning models, powered by [Sabre Travel AI™](https://www.sabre.com/sabre-travel-ai/), optimize all ancillary offers in real time, whether that be seats, bags, Wi-Fi, lounge passes or any other airline ancillary you sell. In practice, [our customers](https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/gol-linhas-aereas-launches-sabre-ancillary-iq/) have seen **incremental ancillary revenue gains of up to 10%** from the use of Ancillary IQ.\n\n> **It’s lights out and away we go**\n> \n> David Croft\n\nThis trademark quote from Formula 1 commentator David Croft sums up the current state of play with airline retailing transformation. Several airlines have already started the race towards their retailing goals with Sabre, and are realizing the tangible benefits of our intelligent, modular and open solutions powered by [Sabre Travel AI™](https://www.sabre.com/page/sabre-travel-ai/). \n\nWith our high-performance technology, we’re accelerating innovation and advancing the travel industry.

The transformation we see in the industry today—from content fragmentation to evolving distribution strategies—is creating pressure.\n\nAs a result, some noteworthy trends have emerged.\n\nNDC is changing the what and the how of content distribution. AI and machine learning have unlocked new possibilities for data optimization, while automation solutions can save serious time and money. To benefit from these advancements, agencies are increasingly turning to technology providers, like Sabre, for help in navigating these new dynamics.\n\nI’ve been in the travel industry for over two decades, working across the corporate travel sector and airlines. Trust me when I say I’ve seen a lot of change since the days before Netflix was a streaming platform and rideshare apps became universal. Today’s consumers expect every facet of their lives to be effortless, which means that tech needs to keep up. **Travelers are more informed and demanding than ever before, with 80% wanting a more personalized experience. 2** To meet these expectations, innovation that delivers both customization and efficiency is essential.\n\nToday, I’m breaking down 4 crucial trends that are shaping the travel ecosystem in ways we can’t ignore.\n\n## Conquering content fragmentation\n\n[Content fragmentation ](https://www.sabre.com/insights/solving-the-content-fragmentation-puzzle/)is becoming an increasingly time-consuming challenge, and if you’re spending so much time aggregating content, **how can you focus on actually growing your business?** As airline strategies diverge, NDC adoption rises, low-cost carriers (LCCs) expand, and new travel tech players emerge the burden on agencies is intensifying. Many agency leaders are already feeling the pressure of having to aggregate content from multiple sources themselves, whether through direct connections or multiple travel technology providers. It’s a lot to handle, and it can quickly become overwhelming. Are you prepared to manage this complexity, or are you at risk of being left behind as the industry continues to evolve?\n\nAt Sabre, we get it. We understand the complexity, [which is why we are continuing to invest in multi-source content and capabilities](https://www.sabre.com/multi-source/). Today, we integrate diverse content from multiple sources into our marketplace, offering normalized content across air and non-air trip components. This helps agencies offer broad and relevant content without sacrificing efficiency. Ultimately, we help them do what they do best—create great experiences for their customers.\n\nBut we’re not stopping there. We are continually enhancing our multi-source capabilities, by implementing shopping, booking, and advanced post-booking automation for greater efficiency. We’re also infusing cutting-edge AI and machine learning technology into our product portfolio to drive even better results.\n\nThese innovations turn content fragmentation challenges into growth opportunities, enabling agencies to thrive in an ever-evolving travel landscape.\n\n[50+ airlines live or in our NDC pipeline](http://www.sabre.com/insights/ndc)\n\n## NDC is here\n\n[NDC is rapidly becoming a significant force in the travel industry. ](http://www.sabre.com/insights/ndc)In June 2024, 21.5% of ARC’s monthly transaction volume came from NDC – a 14.4% increase year over year, with more than 1,000 travel agencies processing NDC transactions.3 This growing adoption underscores the urgency for agencies to integrate NDC into their operations. **Are you keeping pace with this shift, or could you be missing out as the industry continues to evolve?**\n\nThe journey to full NDC adoption in North America is still in progress. It’s had its challenges along the way, [but there’s also a lot of potential](https://www.sabre.com/insights/ndc/#kathy). As agencies tap into the richer content and ancillary services that airlines offer through NDC, they’ll be able to elevate their content offerings and deliver even better travel experiences. But first, the industry needs to ensure NDC is seamlessly integrated into agency workflows so that agents and customers can shop, book, and service travel options quickly, efficiently, and conveniently.\n\n[It’s clear the future of travel content is hybrid: traditional EDIFACT options and NDC offers are – and will continue to be — distributed in parallel.](https://www.sabre.com/insights/booking-ndc-content-is-easy-in-the-sabre-gds/) At Sabre, we understand that this adds complexity. We’re committed to helping simplify this evolution for agencies. We take on the heavy lifting of aggregating, integrating, and normalizing EDIFACT, LCC, and NDC content, so agencies can focus on what matters most – serving their customers.\n\n[Corporate travel, in particular, has its own set of complex servicing needs, and we’ve made significant investments to ensure that NDC works effectively for Travel Management Companies (TMCs) and Online Booking Tools (OBTs)](https://www.sabre.com/insights/ndc/#business). We want travel to access and manage content easily, regardless of the technical source, so they can keep delivering exceptional service to their clients.\n\nSave up to 72% of agents’ time and achieve up to 21% in cost savings with automation solutions\n\n## Embracing automation\n\nI constantly hear from our customers that they spend the majority of their workday on manual, non-revenue generating activities. **Can you afford to keep operating this way?** [Implementing post-booking automation solutions isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s a game-changer.](https://www.sabre.com/post-booking-automation/) When it comes to post-booking tasks—things like booking management, handling schedule changes, and managing travel documentation—automation can streamline these time-consuming processes significantly. Not only does this boost operational efficiency, but also it enhances productivity and reclaims valuable time and resources that could be better spent on driving revenue and delivering exceptional service.\n\nBy automating repetitive processes, agencies can manage more business without increasing resources, leading to lower operational costs and better customer experiences. In a fast-paced industry where every second counts, can you really afford to ignore the critical edge that automation offers? The reality is clear: if you’re not embracing automation, you risk falling behind.\n\n## AI/ML is powering travel\n\n**In 2024, AI is expected to influence 32% of all travel industry revenue. 4 **This is a trend that travel agencies can’t afford to ignore. Integrating AI into your business is crucial, not just for staying competitive but for unlocking significant growth and efficiency. As AI reshapes the industry, those who embrace it will thrive.\n\n61% of US consumers are already willing to use conversational AI to plan their trips5\n\nThe growing willingness of consumers to use forms of AI is a clear signal of where the market is headed. The opportunity for North American agencies to leverage AI is enormous, not just to streamline processes, but to deliver personalized service and drive incremental revenue. The demand is clear, and the opportunity to transform your business through AI has never been greater. Don’t let your competitors leave you behind.\n\nTake it further: by freeing up time for travel agents to focus on complex, personalized services, AI doesn’t just enhance efficiency—it empowers your team to deliver the kind of customized experiences that set you apart. So, ask yourself, are you making the most of this transformative technology.\n\n[At Sabre, we’re leading the charge in developing AI-powered technology through our partnership with Google.](https://www.sabre.com/insights/developing-ai-powered-tech-for-agencies-in-partnership-with-google/) Products like our Lodging AI solution enables agencies to offer more personalized lodging options tailored to the individual needs of travelers, while our email analyzer tool can turn an inbound email into an itinerary, significantly boosting agency productivity.\n\nThese AI-driven tools unlock new revenue opportunities by enabling travel agencies to offer more personalized services and targeted offers that enhance the overall customer journey. We’re committed to listening and learning from our customers to understand their needs so we can develop the right technology to help them thrive.\n\n## Embracing the future: simplifying travel through innovation\n\nAs the travel industry evolves with advancements in NDC and LCC content, automation solutions, and AI applications, it is crucial for agencies to embrace these innovations to meet the dynamic needs of modern travelers. Sabre is the technology partner that can help travel agencies shop, book and service multi-source content efficiently and intelligently, today – and tomorrow.\n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/dxp-header.webp)\n\n### **Discover the Power of More**\n\nTravel tech is evolving fast.

These include flights, seat upgrades, additional baggage allowances, in-flight meals and lounge access – as well as offerings from third parties such as car hire, airport transfers, accommodation and excursions.\n\n[**Orders**](#modal-ecs9n88yf7) are the transactions through which customers purchase the offers presented to them. Once a traveler selects an offer, whether it’s a flight ticket, an upgrade or any other ancillary service, they create an order. This order contains details such as the chosen offer, the price, the customer’s personal information, payment details and any additional preferences or requirements. \n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/OrderManagementBlogImage_MOSAIC.webp)\n\n## **Why is order management important?**\n\nThe core function of an Order Management System is to maintain the integrity of the offer through the order and fulfillment process (i.e. to ensure that everything contained in the offer is accurately transferred to the order and delivered seamlessly to the traveler with a robust audit trail). This becomes particularly important – and more complex – when the offer includes products or services from a third party. But catering to travelers’ end-to-end travel needs while delivering high levels of customer satisfaction is vital if airlines are to increase revenue and combat dwindling profit margins.\n\n> **Airlines could jeopardize their customer satisfaction, brand reputation and revenue performance by introducing new offerings that they can’t service**.\n> \n> **Vanessa Gonzalez** Director | Sabre\n\n[Transitioning to offer- and order-based airline retailing](https://www.sabre.com/open/airlines/) will enable airlines to think of the customer journey holistically and embrace greater customer-centricity. Order management supports:\n\n  * During **booking** (where the focus shifts from offer to order) airlines can enable a more streamlined order process, including instantaneous booking and vastly expanded payment options.\n  * Frictionless retailing does not end once the order is placed. It becomes part of every **pre-travel** touchpoint, where relevant ancillary offers can be presented at the right time to enrich the customer trip experience while generating incremental revenue for the airline.\n  * On the **day of** **travel** , order-based servicing (with secure real-time data exchange across partners where necessary), can facilitate a convenient, consistent and connected traveler experience.\n  * The seamless customer journey experience enabled by orders extends **post-travel** with instantaneous loyalty accrual and automatic trip interruption compensation credits.\n\n\n\nIt’s not that things are impossible in the legacy world – it’s that the existing systems weren’t designed to respond to the market needs we’re experiencing in today’s digitalized world. The cost of doing nothing is that the status quo prevails, and that means airlines use complex workarounds that add cost and slow innovation.\n\n## **What are the financial benefits of order management?**\n\nToday, the process of selling and servicing travel is too complex. Order management seeks to streamline fulfillment and delivery by simplifying airline reservation, delivery, and accounting systems. By phasing out traditional constructs such as PNRs, e-tickets and EMDs and combining them into a single traveler-focused order, airlines will be able to deliver a more seamless end-to-end travel experience – and in so doing, **unlock significant financial opportunity**.\n\nThere’s a potential benefit of **$7 per passenger** per year as a result of retailing transformation. \n\nIn their [business case](https://storage.pardot.com/123902/1680153969rCfTs5nF/Modern_Airline_Retailing___A_Business_Case____March_2023_.pdf) for airline retailing transformation, IATA validates projections from a [2019 McKinsey report](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/travel%20logistics%20and%20infrastructure/our%20insights/airline%20retailing%20the%20value%20at%20stake/where%20is%20the%20value%20in%20retailing_summary_distribution.pdf) to arrive at a potential benefit of **$7 per passenger** per year as a result of retailing transformation. It’s a huge opportunity. One that airlines can’t afford to pass up.\n\nThose benefits are comprised of both increased revenue and cost reductions. Of the $7 per passenger incremental value, around **25% ($1.70) is unlocked through order management**. A common misconception is that order management is all about cost reduction. The reality is that the value creation from order management is an almost equal split between increased revenue and lower costs.\n\n![](https://www.crt.aws.sabrenow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/IATA-Chart-180823_V2.png)\n\nOrder management is essential if airlines are to unlock the full benefits of [NDC](https://www.sabre.com/insights/ndc/) – specifically when it comes to selling and servicing a wide range of lucrative third-party offerings – and airlines that do not have robust order management could severely limit their ability to service new offerings in the future.\n\n## **What does the transition to order management look like?**\n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/991A20E8_M982GW-1440x960-1.jpg)\n\n**An airline guide to modern retailing** Explore the different paths airlines can take on their journey toward a world of offers and orders.\n\n[Explore now](#)\n\nMany airlines are already experimenting with more [personalized offers](https://www.sabre.com/retail-intelligence/) and they are realizing the revenue rewards. It is a popular starting point in the transition towards modern retailing, with clear and easy-to-measure financial benefits.\n\nBut they are only scratching the surface.\n\nIf airlines aspire to create more complex traveler offers that encompass third-party products and meet the end-to-end travel needs of the customer, **seamless servicing with orders becomes critical**. A well-crafted order management strategy is therefore critical to [airline transformation towards modern retailing](https://www.sabre.com/open/offer-order-strategy/).\n\nSabre’s [phased transition path](https://www.sabre.com/open/airlines/) to order management is designed to:\n\n  * Deliver value by implementing order capabilities (such as the ability to generate partner interline seat offers)\n  * Mitigate risk by maintaining full synchronization between the order and the associated reference PNR\n  * Develop a ‘learning partnership’ as we move into the hybrid world, ensuring all EDIFACT dependencies are addressed before discontinuing use of the PSS\n\n\n\n## **How can airlines get started with orders?**\n\nGetting started with orders can be relatively quick and easy, and most importantly it has the potential to add value for your airline from the outset. We’re already working with several airlines looking to progress along the path towards full order management.\n\nA good starting point is to work with your tech provider to **identify Minimum Viable Product (MVP) opportunities**. This low-risk approach can be an efficient way to deploy a solution with real-world benefits – such as addressing an existing pain point – alongside your existing tech stack. It fits with Sabre’s [phased and modular approach to industry transformation](https://www.sabre.com/resources/view/benefits-of-transition-approach/), enabling airlines to continue using existing systems while adopting new solutions as part of the transition to offer and order management.\n\n[![](https://www.crt.aws.sabrenow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/1851570301-0267e50146c056867f442dd7efb98ddb9d8dd91aaab6b94c2297d66f43560577-d-1440x810.webp)]()\n\n### [**Explore SabreMosaic** ]()\n\n[The transition to offer- and order-based retailing is a multi-year industry-wide undertaking, with individual airlines at different stages of the transformation journey. **See how**]()**[SabreMosaic](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic) – our revolutionary airline retailing platform can help you get started.**\n\n[Get started](https://www.sabre.com/mosaic/)\n\n## Related Insights\n\n  * [ ![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Mosaic_F1_Blog_June2024-720x415.webp) November 11, 2024  Intelligent airline retailing: Lessons from the Formula 1 grid  The Formula 1 season is in full swing and – thanks to the Netflix show ‘Drive to Survive’ – its popularity is surging.

The principles of openness and modularity (integral to the next-gen [SabreMosaic](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic) retailing platform) are ideally suited to airline retailing. They point towards airlines being in control of their tech platform and being able to collaborate with whomever they choose to build solutions that best meet their needs. \n\nOpenness and modularity don’t just deliver benefits for airlines either; they also support a competitive marketplace and align with the drive towards greater traveler-centricity, a concept explored in [this blog](https://www.sabre.com/insights/non-personalization-the-key-to-retailing-success-for-airlines/).\n\n## **Open to change**\n\nCreating an open environment – whether in technology or business more broadly – fosters an open flow of communication, adaptability to change, and a commitment to collaboration. Many great leaders embody this principle with an ‘open door’ or ‘open calendar’ policy. They are approachable and supportive, always willing to find time in their busy schedule for a conversation.\n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/sabre-google-2-min-1440x712.jpg)\n\nWhen it comes to achieving shared goals, exceptional leaders understand the value of collaborating with co-workers to solve problems and strategize. They appreciate that openness creates more diverse business ideas and opportunities which ultimately translate into long-term success.\n\n## **The benefits of an open tech ecosystem**\n\nThe same is true of an open tech ecosystem. Such an ecosystem supports and encourages integrations with other technologies, services and platforms. Conversely, a closed system only interacts with tools that are inside or compatible with that platform. Closed systems dictate a single vendor solution from end to end, which runs contrary to the goal of becoming a modern retailer.\n\nBeing open to innovation and new opportunities is the optimal approach for travelers, airlines and the wider industry. Here are three ways in which [SabreMosaic](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic) is ‘open’ and the benefits that result:\n\n##### **1. Open for flexibility of choice**\n\nSabreMosaic is technically open and accessible, ensuring flexibility of choice and faster speed to market for our airline partners.\n\nAirlines can pick and choose not just at the module level but also at the individual product and capability level – a big differentiator for Sabre. Unlike some of our competitors, we believe airlines should be free to curate the solutions that best meet their needs, which means having the ability to integrate Sabre solutions, in-house capabilities and third-party offerings. Airlines have access to the same APIs for offers and orders regardless of the modules used.\n\nWhile we believe there are added benefits from adopting complementary modules, technical openness means Sabre can better meet airline needs by enabling them to select the best-suited (or best-in-class) functionalities, even if they are not proprietary to Sabre.\n\n##### **2. Open for retailing diverse content from third parties**\n\nThe ability to source and display content from a wide range of third-party vendors with offer APIs holds the key to long term retailing success for airlines.\n\nAirlines have become increasingly sophisticated in the way they market and sell first-party ancillaries, such as preferred seat allocation, baggage, in-flight Wi-Fi and meals or drinks. Now, Sabre’s open platform enables airlines to extend their offering to include everything from hotels and car hire to ground transportation, event tickets and other experiences.\n\nLet’s take a look at the Distribution & Partnerships product suite of [SabreMosaic](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic). This suite is open by design and exists to maximize partner reach and revenue potential for airlines. The API-first products, like SabreMosaic Third-Party Content Management, offer comprehensive channel and partner content management so you have greater control of the attributes, applicability rules, and how you differentiate your offers. Working with partners who are not quite on offers and orders? Sabre has designed a legacy translation layer to connect back to third-party providers still using traditional technology, so you can continue to run your business seamlessly.\n\nUntil now, airlines have operated with a ‘flight first’ or ‘flight + air ancillary’ approach. As third-party ancillaries become core to airline offerings (as is the case with many OTAs today), they’ll be positioned to offer the ‘total trip’ concept that better aligns with the needs of travelers while opening up new revenue opportunities for airlines.\n\n##### **3. Open for applying advanced data and intelligence**\n\nThe [newest applications of advanced AI/ML](https://www.sabre.com/insights/five-ai-ml-use-cases-that-help-airlines-drive-revenue-part1/) have the potential to accelerate airline retailing, and [SabreMosaic](http://www.sabre.com/mosaic) is open to incorporating the latest developments in this field – whether they are developed in-house by airlines, built by Sabre or sourced from third-party providers.\n\nThis ‘bring-your-own-science’ concept is made possible by our open ecosystem and will enable airlines to optimize revenue opportunities and deliver a more tailored, traveler-centric experience. Our [airline partners](https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/virgin-australia-expands-long-term-partnership-with-sabre-by-deploying-intelligent-retailing-solutions-powered-by-sabre-travel-ai/) will remain in control of their customer data at all times, with the ability to manage it externally and bring it into Sabre’s ecosystem to build offers and fulfil orders.\n\n### **AIRLINE RETAILING** **IQ TEST**\n\nLearn how Sabre’s IQ products can lead to higher revenue in just 3 minutes.\n\n[Take the Test](https://www.sabre.com/retail-intelligence/)\n\nLet’s take a look at the Data Intelligence suite of SabreMosaic. This centralized data platform is a [Google](https://www.sabre.com/insights/sabre-google-partnership/) cloud-native warehouse that supports real-time and event driven updates from multiple internal and external sources, providing you with a complete view of your ecosystem. Want to take advantage of dynamic retailing? Sabre’s IQ products are complimented with a real-time feedback loop with ML-driven insights that are applied throughout SabreMosaic so you can make the most of your retailing strategies.\n\nSabreMosaic’s Data Intelligence suite brings to market an advanced experimentation framework using advanced AI and machine learning algorithms. Incorporate your full ecosystem view to test multiple retailing variables in a live shopping environment. Airlines who take advantage of the experimentation product will learn which products are most relevant to buyers, at what stage to sell them, at what price, and how to bundle them for highest conversion.\n\nAirlines can also develop their own ML models in all points of sale to power more intelligent recommendations (for better forecasting and predictions) which better meet traveler needs and are therefore more likely to convert into revenue opportunities.\n\n![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/1851570301-0267e50146c056867f442dd7efb98ddb9d8dd91aaab6b94c2297d66f43560577-d-1440x810-1.webp)\n\n### **Your journey starts here**\n\nOur ten modular technology suites are here and ready to work. Sabre is committed to this flexible approach so you can take your airline to the new world of Offers and Orders. Choose the components you are ready for now. Add more later. It is up to you.\n\n[Explore SabreMosaic](/mosaic)\n\n## Ice Ice Baby\n\nIn case you’re wondering, yes, the title of this blog was deliberate. Sabre is building a retail travel marketplace that **intelligently** enables airlines to dynamically retail and distribute a broad **choice** of tailored offers across any channel and fulfil them as orders with **ease** via an open, flexible, and cloud-native platform. With a [strategy](https://www.sabre.com/page/offer-order-strategy/) built around the concepts of intelligence, choice and ease (or ICE) the throwback reference to a certain 1990 song by Dallas native Vanilla Ice proved hard to resist. \n\n****View the video for quick explainer on SabreMosaic’s open ecosystem****\n\n[ ![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Open_Thumbnail_SabreMosaic.webp) ](#modal-t9q4vyalap)\n\n## Related Insights\n\n  * [ ![](https://www.sabre.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Mosaic_F1_Blog_June2024-720x415.webp) November 11, 2024  Intelligent airline retailing: Lessons from the Formula 1 grid  The Formula 1 season is in full swing and – thanks to the Netflix show ‘Drive to Survive’ – its popularity is surging.
