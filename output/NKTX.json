(Nasdaq: NKTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered natural killer (NK) cell therapies, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"We’re encouraged by the early progress that we’ve made in the clinical investigation of NKX019 for autoimmune disease,” said Paul J. Hastings, CEO of Nkarta. “Having dosed a first patient in both Ntrust-1 and the Columbia University Irving Medical Center IST, our learnings can help us optimize the execution of our current and future clinical trials. This includes our Ntrust-2 trial, which is on track to initiate enrollment later this year. Safety and accessibility are paramount in autoimmune disease, and we believe that an off-the-shelf, engineered NK cell therapy has the greatest potential to help patients.”\n\nHastings continued, “We have decided to forgo future development of NKX019 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In reviewing the clinical data from the latest cohort of patients with large B-cell lymphoma and the evolving treatment landscape, Nkarta will focus its efforts on autoimmune diseases, where we believe NKX019 has potential to transform patient care.”\n\n**Clinical development of NKX019 for autoimmune diseases advances**\n\n  * Dosing of the first patient in Ntrust-1, a clinical trial of NKX019 for the treatment of lupus nephritis. As previously announced, the first Ntrust-1 patient entered screening in June 2024.\n  * Dosing of the first patient in the IST of NKX019 in systemic lupus erythematosus at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). As previously announced, the CUIMC IST was initiated in July 2024.\n  * Both studies continue to enroll participants.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated autoimmune milestones 2024-2025**\n\n  * Initiation of patient enrollment expected by year-end 2024 in Ntrust-2, a clinical trial of NKX019 for the treatment of systemic sclerosis, myositis and vasculitis. As previously announced, the Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for Ntrust-2 cleared in June 2024.\n  * Preliminary clinical data from Ntrust-1 and Ntrust-2 clinical trials planned for 2025.\n\n\n\n**Update for NKX019 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)**\n\n  * A cohort of seven patients with heavily pretreated large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) whose disease progressed following treatment with a CD19 CAR T-cell therapy received NKX019 on Days 0, 3, and 7 following lymphodepletion.\n  * There were no cases of Grade >2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and no cases of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity (ICANS).\n  * Five patients achieved a partial response after a first cycle of treatment. One of these five patients achieved a complete response with >6 months durability after receiving a second cycle of treatment.\n  * Nkarta aims to report final data from the LBCL cohort at a future medical conference.\n  * Nkarta will forgo further development in NHL and prioritize development efforts on autoimmune diseases.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Nkarta had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable securities of $405.3 million as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Research and development (R&D) expenses were $25.3 million for the third quarter of 2024. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in R&D expense was $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2024.\n  * General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $8.5 million for the third quarter of 2024. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in G&A expense was $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2024.\n  * Net loss was $28.3 million, or $0.39 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024. This net loss includes non-cash charges of $5.8 million that consisted primarily of share-based compensation and depreciation expenses.\n\n\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\n  * Nkarta expects its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its current operating plan into late 2027.\n\n\n\n**About NKX019** NKX019 is an allogeneic, cryopreserved, off-the-shelf immunotherapy candidate that uses natural killer (NK) cells derived from the peripheral blood of healthy adult donors. It is engineered with a humanized CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) for enhanced cell targeting and a proprietary, membrane-bound form of interleukin-15 (IL-15) for greater persistence and activity without exogenous cytokine support. CD19 is a biomarker for normal B cells as well as those implicated in autoimmune disease and B cell-derived malignancies.\n\n**About Ntrust™ Clinical Trials in Autoimmune Disease** Ntrust-1 and Ntrust-2 are multi-center, open label, dose escalation clinical trials that build on academic studies of durable, drug-free remissions in patients with autoimmune disease after CD19-targeted cell therapy. Both trials will assess the safety of NKX019 in people living with autoimmune diseases as well as its ability to enable long-term remissions via a “reset” of the immune system through the elimination of pathogenic B cells. Per the trial protocols, patients receive three-dose cycles of NKX019 at 1 billion or 1.5 billion cells per dose following single-agent lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide, an agent with an established safety profile across autoimmune diseases. Leveraging the engineering of NKX019, no patients in either trial will receive supplemental cytokines or antibody-based therapeutics. This approach is designed to evaluate the single-agent activity of NKX019 and facilitate a more rapid path to regulatory approval.\n\nIn the Ntrust-1 study ([NCT06557265](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3s-yTwWANZyyTvlSReHc4bP9foDkGEF0H8nQjAZ4mysLNZ9lxPX3G1lZdWiRfGa9ggWReM2EOIdMuErE_RdTSUAXych1HEvR9tN9QPnQrFs=)), patients with refractory lupus nephritis receive three-dose cycles of NKX019 following lymphodepletion. Patients in Ntrust-1 may also receive additional cycles to restore response.\n\nOnce initiated, Ntrust-2 will enroll patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (myositis), and ANCA-associated vasculitis into parallel cohorts, and NKX019 will be dosed on Days 0, 3, and 7, a regimen that may be advantageous across all Nkarta clinical trials. Each trial is designed to initially enroll up to 12 patients.\n\n**About the Investigator-Sponsored Clinical Trial of NKX019 for Systemic Lupus Nephritis** The single-center, single-arm, open-label Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial is designed to enroll up to 6 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, regardless of renal involvement, and will evaluate safety and clinical outcomes in a potentially different population than Ntrust-1. Translational and biomarker studies, including autoantibodies, cytokine profiles and pharmacokinetics are also planned. Patients receive NKX019 following single-agent lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide. The clinical trial is being led by Anca D. Askanase, M.D., M.P.H., Director, Lupus Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the Director of Rheumatology Clinical Trials.\n\n**About Nkarta** Nkarta is a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing the development of allogeneic, off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell therapies.
