The Fund will allow Alaska Communications to continue deployment and operation of broadband across its service areas. Beginning January 1, 2029, the Alaska Connect Fund will provide ongoing support through the end of 2034 for the operation and maintenance of deployed broadband and voice networks throughout the state. The amount of support and eligible locations for the second phase of funding will be determined by FCC staff and will take into consideration broadband deployment funded through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (“BEAD”) Program in Alaska. The State of Alaska received over $1 billion in BEAD funding, which will be distributed by the Alaska Broadband Office.\n\n“Alaska Communications is pleased to reach this important milestone with the FCC, setting the stage for continued deployment of affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband in our rural communities. We know how critical broadband is for education, healthcare, economic development and quality of life,” said Matt McConnell, Alaska Communications president and CEO. “We thank the FCC, along with Senator Murkowski, Senator Sullivan and Congresswoman Peltola for their support in bringing this much-needed financial support to our state.”\n\nIn 2017, Alaska Communications started participating in the FCC’s Connect America Fund Phase II High Cost universal service program in Alaska. Since that time, the company has deployed affordable, reliable, high-speed internet to nearly 30,000 locations in Alaska, including Coffman Cove, Delta Junction, Homer, Hope, Hoonah, Kake, Kasilof, Kenai, Klawock, Larsen Bay, Ninilchik, North Kenai, North Pole, Seldovia, Soldotna and Sterling.\n\nThe ACF is the next phase of the High Cost program and will support upgraded speeds and continued broadband deployment in these communities.\n\n**About Alaska Communications**\n\nAlaska Communications, an affiliate of ATN International, Inc.

(“ATN” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ATNI), a leading provider of digital infrastructure and communications services, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Remarks by Brad Martin, ATN Chief Executive Officer**\n\n“We reported strong free cash flow from operations in the third quarter, driven by effective cost and net working capital management. Our performance continues to reflect a tale of two segments, with revenues impacted primarily by underperformance in our US Telecom segment related to the conclusion of certain government subsidy programs, slower consumer growth, and delays in enterprise sales and delivery. Based on these dynamics, and compression in market multiples, we recorded a non-cash $35 million goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter.\n\n“In the International Telecom segment, solid fixed revenue gains and business mobility revenue growth offset softness in consumer mobility related to competitive pressures, and we delivered Adjusted EBITDA growth. Additionally, we increased our international post-paid mobile subscriber bases both sequentially and year-over-year.\n\n“To reflect our expectations for near-term operating performance, we are lowering our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for fiscal 2024 and increasing our expected leverage multiple exiting the year. We are taking strategic actions intended to align our cost structure with current revenue levels, while focusing on margin improvement and cash flow generation. These actions include refocusing efforts on growing our business and carrier customer revenues in the US, strengthening sales execution teams, and maximizing value from deployed assets.\n\n“Longer term, we remain committed to leveraging the value and longevity of our upgraded network while diligently operating the business in an effort to further expand cash flows and position ATN to deliver increased value for shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Consolidated revenues** were $178.5 million, down 7% versus $191.0 million in the year-ago quarter. This primarily reflects the overall revenue decline in the US Telecom segment due in part to the anticipated impact of the end of the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) and Affordable Care Program (ACP), and a reduction in construction revenues for the quarter.\n\n**Operating loss** was $38.4 million in the third quarter versus operating income of $6.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a $35.3 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge on certain US Telecom assets, $3.8 million of transaction-related charges, and $2.3 million of restructuring and reorganization expenses.\n\n**Net loss attributable to ATN stockholders** in the third quarter of 2024 was $32.7 million, or a loss of $2.26 per share compared with a net loss attributable to ATN stockholders of $3.6 million, or $0.31 loss per share, in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year change was the result of the above-mentioned factors that increased the operating loss combined with an increase in interest expense. In all periods, the loss per share calculation includes the impact of preferred dividends that are not included in the net loss calculation.\n\n**Adjusted****EBITDA****1** was $45.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease from $47.8 million in the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower US Telecom revenues.\n\n**Segment Operating Results (in Thousands)**\n\nThe Company recorded financial results in three categories: (i) International Telecom; (ii) US Telecom; and (iii) Corporate and Other*.\n\n**For Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**International** | **International** | **US** | **US** | **Corporate and** | **Corporate and** | **Total** | **Total**  \n**Telecom** | **Telecom** | **Telecom** | **Telecom** | **Other*** | **Other*** | **ATN** | **ATN**  \n**Total Revenue:** | **$** | **94,281** | **$** | **93,878** | **$** | **84,170** | **$** | **97,158** | **$** | **-** | **$** | **-** | **$** | **178,451** | **$** | **191,036**  \n**Mobility** | 26,809 | 27,791 | 706 | 946 | - | - | 27,515 | 28,737  \n**Fixed** | 61,759 | 59,983 | 51,015 | 58,342 | - | - | 112,774 | 118,325  \n**Carrier Services** | 3,272 | 3,441 | 29,430 | 32,319 | - | - | 32,702 | 35,760  \n**Construction** | - | - | 203 | 2,038 | - | - | 203 | 2,038  \n**All other** | 2,441 | 2,663 | 2,816 | 3,513 | - | - | 5,257 | 6,176  \n**Operating Income (Loss)** | $ | 12,853 | $ | 12,800 | $ | (44,333 | ) | $ | 3,018 | $ | (6,878 | ) | $ | (8,981 | ) | $ | (38,358 | ) | $ | 6,837  \n**EBITDA**** | $ | 31,518 | $ | 27,394 | $ | (23,912 | ) | $ | 25,299 | $ | (6,674 | ) | $ | (8,363 | ) | $ | 932 | $ | 44,330  \n**Adjusted EBITDA****1** | $ | 32,248 | $ | 27,502 | $ | 17,692 | $ | 26,860 | $ | (4,270 | ) | $ | (6,516 | ) | $ | 45,670 | $ | 47,846  \n**Capital Expenditures***** | $ | 10,489 | $ | 18,744 | $ | 13,070 | $ | 18,445 | $ | 282 | $ | - | $ | 23,841 | $ | 37,189  \n**For Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**International** | **International** | **US** | **US** | **Corporate and** | **Corporate and** | **Total** | **Total**  \n**Telecom** | **Telecom** | **Telecom** | **Telecom** | **Other*** | **Other*** | **ATN** | **ATN**  \n**Total Revenue:** | **$** | **282,697** | **$** | **276,267** | **$** | **265,830** | **$** | **286,983** | **$** | **-** | **$** | **-** | **$** | **548,527** | **$** | **563,250**  \n**Mobility** | 79,657 | 80,754 | 2,312 | 3,081 | - | - | 81,969 | 83,835  \n**Fixed** | 185,295 | 178,546 | 161,392 | 175,346 | - | - | 346,687 | 353,892  \n**Carrier Services** | 10,481 | 11,011 | 89,539 | 95,978 | - | - | 100,020 | 106,989  \n**Construction** | - | - | 2,609 | 3,648 | - | - | 2,609 | 3,648  \n**All other** | 7,264 | 5,956 | 9,978 | 8,930 | - | - | 17,242 | 14,886  \n**Operating Income (Loss)** | $ | 56,944 | $ | 41,177 | $ | (42,852 | ) | $ | (3,719 | ) | $ | (23,559 | ) | $ | (27,547 | ) | $ | (9,467 | ) | $ | 9,911  \n**EBITDA**** | $ | 108,512 | $ | 84,807 | $ | 18,361 | $ | 67,126 | $ | (23,229 | ) | $ | (25,517 | ) | $ | 103,644 | $ | 126,416  \n**Adjusted EBITDA****1** | $ | 94,808 | $ | 85,089 | $ | 60,313 | $ | 72,443 | $ | (17,260 | ) | $ | (19,097 | ) | $ | 137,861 | $ | 138,435  \n**Capital Expenditures***** | $ | 39,440 | $ | 57,610 | $ | 44,371 | $ | 69,030 | $ | 1,860 | $ | - | $ | 85,671 | $ | 126,640  \n  \n* Corporate and Other refer to corporate overhead expenses and consolidating adjustments.** See Table 5 for reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure***Excludes government capital program amounts disbursed, and amounts received.\n\n**ATN’s Strategic Plan and Key Performance Indicators**\n\nThe Company is in the final quarter of its three-year strategic plan initiated in 2021 to accelerate investments in its high-speed data footprint and grow high speed broadband subscribers.

The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this press release. While non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating the Company’s own operating results over different periods of time, the Company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\n\n**Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements relating to, among other matters, the Company’s future financial performance, business goals and objectives, and results of operations, expectations regarding its strategic investment plan, its future revenues, operating income, operating margin, cash flows, network and operating costs, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt, Net Debt Ratio, cost management initiatives, and capital investments; demand for the Company’s services and industry trends; the timing of revenue, the Company’s liquidity; the expansion of the Company’s customer base and networks; receipt of certain government grants and management’s plans, expectations and strategy for the future. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results. Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1) the general performance of the Company’s operations, including operating margins, revenues, capital expenditures, the impact of cost savings initiatives, the ability to expand its carrier and business customer sales, and the retention of and future growth of the Company’s subscriber base and ARPU; (2) the Company’s reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to the Company’s network infrastructure; (3) the Company’s ability to satisfy the needs and demands of the Company’s major carrier customers; (4) the Company’s ability to realize expansion plans for customer growth on its existing assets; (5) the adequacy and expansion capabilities of the Company’s network capacity and customer service system to support the Company’s customer growth; (6) the Company’s ability to efficiently and cost-effectively upgrade the Company’s networks and information technology platforms to address rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; (7) the Company’s continued access to capital and credit markets on terms it deems favorable; (8) government subsidy program availability and regulation of the Company’s businesses, which may impact the Company’s telecommunications licenses, the Company’s revenue and the Company’s operating costs; (9) the Company’s ability to successfully transition its US Telecom business away from wholesale mobility to other carrier, enterprise, and consumer-based services; (10) ongoing risk of an economic downturn, political, geopolitical and other risks and opportunities facing the Company’s operations, including those resulting from the continued inflation and other macroeconomic headwinds including increased costs and supply chain disruptions; (11) management transitions, and the loss of, or an inability to recruit skilled personnel in the Company’s various jurisdictions, including key members of management; (12) the Company’s ability to find investment or acquisition or disposition opportunities that fit the strategic goals of the Company; (13) the occurrence of weather events and natural catastrophes and the Company’s ability to secure the appropriate level of insurance coverage for these assets; and the impact of such events on the timing of project implementation and corresponding revenue, and (14) increased competition. These and other additional factors that may cause actual future events and results to differ materially from the events and results indicated in the forward-looking statements above are set forth more fully under Item 1A “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, and the other reports the Company files from time to time with the SEC.
