Based on current\nassessment of management, cash and forecasted cash flows from operations are not expected to be sufficient\nto meet the Company’s obligations coming due over the next twelve months, and, as a result, the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern is dependent on, among other things, its ability to raise additional funds\nin order to meet its capital requirements and satisfy its obligations as they become due (such as upcoming\ninterest payment obligations under, and repayment at maturity of, certain of its debt instruments), including in\nconnection with the expiration of the covenant relief period on November 15, 2024 and/or the maturity of the\nFinalta-CDPQ Loan Agreement on November 30, 2024\nLiquidity management and cost control remain a top priority\n15\nAppendix\n16\nAppendix A - Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Other Performance Metrics\nAdjusted EBITDA\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net earnings (loss) before finance costs, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude restructuring costs, share-based\ncompensation, change in fair value of conversion options on convertible debt instruments, change in fair value of share warrant obligations, foreign exchange (gain) loss and transaction and other non-\nrecurring expenses. Lion uses adjusted EBITDA to facilitate a comparison of the profitability of its business on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide a further understanding of factors and\ntrends affecting its business. The Company also believes this measure is useful for investors to assess the Company's profitability, its cost structure and its ability to service debt and to meet other payment\nobligations. However, readers should be aware that when evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, Lion may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating Adjusted EBITDA.
