* Revenues increased 10% to $26.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * Gross profit increased 11% to $15.2 million (58% of revenues), compared to $13.8 million (57% of

5% to $4.5 million (17% of revenues), compared to $4.3 million (18% of revenues) for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * ShotSpotter went “live” in four new cities and one university as well as expanded

for approximately $4.0 million as part of an existing $25 million share repurchase program.\n  * Improved cash and cash equivalents position to over $15 million dollars, after accounting for share repurchases. \n\n\n\n1 _See the section below titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to GAAP net income (loss)._\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“SoundThinking delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by 10% revenue growth, gross margin expansion and improving cash generation,” said President and CEO Ralph Clark. “Our third-quarter results, driven by new and expanding customer relationships, underscore the strength and versatility of our innovative SafetySmart™ platform. Our flagship ShotSpotter solution went ‘live’ in four new cities and one university, and expanded coverage in eight existing cities. We also saw robust momentum across our other SafetySmart solutions, with over 15 new customer implementations, reflecting our expanded market reach and growing demand.\n\n“We enhanced our SafePointe solution with upgraded AI-driven software and more powerful hardware components, improving its efficiency and reliability for customers. Additionally, we launched ‘PlateRanger, Powered by Rekor,’ an end-to-end vehicle and License Plate Reader (LPR) public safety solution that is already showing promising synergies and adding value for our customers.\n\n“We believe our focused execution on our strategic priorities is driving diversified growth, strengthening our balance sheet, and enhancing operational efficiencies for long-term success. We anticipate continued momentum into Q4 and 2025, and are energized by the expanding public and private market opportunities ahead.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $26.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the same quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to new and expanding customer subscriptions and contributions from SafePointe, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $15.2 million (58% of revenues), an improvement compared to $13.8 million (57% of revenues) for the same period in 2023.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $16.3 million, compared to $15.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher headcount and employee-related costs, including costs related to SafePointe, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $1.4 million, or $(0.11) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.7 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), compared to net loss of $1.9 million, or $(0.15) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.5 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), for the same period in 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $4.5 million, an increase compared to $4.3 million in the same period last year.\n\nAt quarter end, the company had $15.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $25.9 million in accounts receivable and contract assets, net, $49.5 million in deferred revenue, $4.0 million in debt related to borrowings to partially fund the SafePointe acquisition, and approximately $21.0 million available on its credit facility.\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nThe company reaffirmed its full-year 2024 revenue guidance range of $104.0 million to $106.0 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. The company also still expects Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18% to 20% for the full year 2024.\n\n“Despite the ongoing civic debate regarding the non-renewal of the ShotSpotter contract in Chicago and the loss of that contract with approximately $8.5 million in annual revenue, we remain confident in our ability to drive revenue growth and improve profitability in 2025 and beyond,” added Clark. As a result, we are providing our 2025 guidance as follows: We expect to achieve revenue in the range of $107.0 million to $109.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA between 19% and 21%.\n\nThe company’s financial outlook statements are based on current expectations. The preceding statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement” below. The company has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net income (loss) due to the uncertainty and variability of interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses, and acquisition-related expenses, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income (loss). Because the company cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort. Such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net income (loss). For more information, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nSoundThinking will hold a conference call today November 12, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results and provide an update on business conditions.\n\nSoundThinking management will host the presentation, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nU.S. dial-in: 1-877-407-8029International dial-in: 1-201-689-8029Conference ID: 13749551\n\nA live audio webcast of the conference call will be available in listen-only mode simultaneously and available for replay via the investor relations section of the company’s website at [www.soundthinking.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LCTGdxK_iHutB_s69PlOXglRSqhfKmb75Mjvjzf5A_HF3czPJwB6etFI9wWJog0uPzwtWqDvCVFddXbC0frxilY_Jk8QdvAyznHUg8L6EIY= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management internally to understand and evaluate the company’s core operating performance and trends across accounting periods and in connection with developing future operating plans, making strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and considering initiatives focused on cultivating new markets for its solutions. In particular, the exclusion of these expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of the company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis.\n\nSoundThinking believes adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA also provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. For example, SoundThinking adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses because such expenses often vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in a particular period. Stock-based compensation is utilized by SoundThinking to attract and retain employees with a goal of long-term retention and the alignment of employee interests with those of the company and its stockholders, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period’s financial performance measures, in particular net income (loss), or its other GAAP financial results.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \nGAAP net loss | $ | (1,440 | ) | $ | (1,874 | ) | $ | (5,101 | ) | $ | (6,361 | )  \n_Less:_  \nAcquisition-related expenses | — | 689 | — | 864  \nRestructuring expense | — | — | 346 | —  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets | — | — | 5 | —  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration | — | 82 | (554 | ) | (923 | )  \nAdjusted net loss | $ | (1,440 | ) | $ | (1,103 | ) | $ | (5,304 | ) | $ | (6,420 | )  \nNet loss per share, basic and diluted | $ | (0.11 | ) | $ | (0.15 | ) | $ | (0.40 | ) | $ | (0.52 | )  \nAdjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted | $ | (0.11 | ) | $ | (0.09 | ) | $ | (0.42 | ) | $ | (0.52 | )  \nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share and adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted | 12,688,850 | 12,480,830 | 12,750,664 | 12,320,119  \n  \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \nGAAP net loss | $ | (1,440 | ) | $ | (1,874 | ) | $ | (5,101 | ) | $ | (6,361 | )  \n_Less:_  \nInterest (income) expense, net | (7 | ) | 42 | 176 | (64 | )  \nIncome taxes | 319 | 299 | 667 | 643  \nDepreciation, amortization and impairment | 2,561 | 2,475 | 7,974 | 8,126  \nRestructuring expense | — | — | 346 | —  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets | — | — | 5 | —  \nStock-based compensation expense | 3,054 | 2,573 | 9,127 | 7,272  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration | — | 82 | (554 | ) | (923 | )  \nAcquisition-related expenses | — | 689 | — | 864  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 4,487 | $ | 4,286 | $ | 12,640 | $ | 9,557  \n  \n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to statements regarding the company’s expectations for its estimated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 and 2025, driving diversified growth, strengthening its balance sheet and enhancing operational efficiencies for long-term success, continued momentum into Q4 and 2025, expanding public and private market opportunities ahead, its ability to achieve revenue growth and enhanced profitability in 2025 and beyond, its long-term financial targets, ability to drive profitable growth and build upon existing contracts and partnerships, including in the United States and internationally, operating momentum, financial visibility, sales pipeline, revenue growth, operating leverage and margin expansion.

* Revenues increased 10% to $26.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * Gross profit increased 11% to $15.2 million (58% of revenues), compared to $13.8 million (57% of revenues) for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss totaled $1.4 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.9 million for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 increased approximately 5% to $4.5 million (17% of revenues), compared to $4.3 million (18% of revenues) for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * ShotSpotter went “live” in four new cities and one university as well as expanded with eight current cities.\n  * Enhanced AI-driven software, upgraded hardware components, and initiated SOC2 and HIPAA certification processes for SafePointe, an advanced weapons detection

for approximately $4.0 million as part of an existing $25 million share repurchase program.\n  * Improved cash and cash equivalents position to over $15 million dollars, after accounting for share repurchases. \n\n\n\n1 _See the section below titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to GAAP net income (loss)._\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“SoundThinking delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by 10% revenue growth, gross margin expansion and improving cash generation,” said President and CEO Ralph Clark. “Our third-quarter results, driven by new and expanding customer relationships, underscore the strength and versatility of our innovative SafetySmart™ platform. Our flagship ShotSpotter solution went ‘live’ in four new cities and one university, and expanded coverage in eight existing cities. We also saw robust momentum across our other SafetySmart solutions, with over 15 new customer implementations, reflecting our expanded market reach and growing demand.\n\n“We enhanced our SafePointe solution with upgraded AI-driven software and more powerful hardware components, improving its efficiency and reliability for customers. Additionally, we launched ‘PlateRanger, Powered by Rekor,’ an end-to-end vehicle and License Plate Reader (LPR) public safety solution that is already showing promising synergies and adding value for our customers.\n\n“We believe our focused execution on our strategic priorities is driving diversified growth, strengthening our balance sheet, and enhancing operational efficiencies for long-term success. We anticipate continued momentum into Q4 and 2025, and are energized by the expanding public and private market opportunities ahead.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $26.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the same quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to new and expanding customer subscriptions and contributions from SafePointe, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $15.2 million (58% of revenues), an improvement compared to $13.8 million (57% of revenues) for the same period in 2023.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $16.3 million, compared to $15.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher headcount and employee-related costs, including costs related to SafePointe, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $1.4 million, or $(0.11) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.7 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), compared to net loss of $1.9 million, or $(0.15) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.5 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), for the same period in 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $4.5 million, an increase compared to $4.3 million in the same period last year.\n\nAt quarter end, the company had $15.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $25.9 million in accounts receivable and contract assets, net, $49.5 million in deferred revenue, $4.0 million in debt related to borrowings to partially fund the SafePointe acquisition, and approximately $21.0 million available on its credit facility.\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nThe company reaffirmed its full-year 2024 revenue guidance range of $104.0 million to $106.0 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. The company also still expects Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18% to 20% for the full year 2024.\n\n“Despite the ongoing civic debate regarding the non-renewal of the ShotSpotter contract in Chicago and the loss of that contract with approximately $8.5 million in annual revenue, we remain confident in our ability to drive revenue growth and improve profitability in 2025 and beyond,” added Clark. As a result, we are providing our 2025 guidance as follows: We expect to achieve revenue in the range of $107.0 million to $109.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA between 19% and 21%.\n\nThe company’s financial outlook statements are based on current expectations. The preceding statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement” below. The company has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net income (loss) due to the uncertainty and variability of interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses, and acquisition-related expenses, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income (loss). Because the company cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort. Such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net income (loss). For more information, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nSoundThinking will hold a conference call today November 12, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results and provide an update on business conditions.\n\nSoundThinking management will host the presentation, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nU.S. dial-in: 1-877-407-8029International dial-in: 1-201-689-8029Conference ID: 13749551\n\nA live audio webcast of the conference call will be available in listen-only mode simultaneously and available for replay via the investor relations section of the company’s website at [www.soundthinking.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LCTGdxK_iHutB_s69PlOXglRSqhfKmb75Mjvjzf5A_HF3czPJwB6etFI9wWJog0uPzwtWqDvCVFddXbC0frxilY_Jk8QdvAyznHUg8L6EIY= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management internally to understand and evaluate the company’s core operating performance and trends across accounting periods and in connection with developing future operating plans, making strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and considering initiatives focused on cultivating new markets for its solutions. In particular, the exclusion of these expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of the company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis.\n\nSoundThinking believes adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA also provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. For example, SoundThinking adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses because such expenses often vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in a particular period. Stock-based compensation is utilized by SoundThinking to attract and retain employees with a goal of long-term retention and the alignment of employee interests with those of the company and its stockholders, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period’s financial performance measures, in particular net income (loss), or its other GAAP financial results.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \nGAAP net loss | $ | (1,440 | ) | $ | (1,874 | ) | $ | (5,101 | ) | $ | (6,361 | )  \n_Less:_  \nAcquisition-related expenses | — | 689 | — | 864  \nRestructuring expense | — | — | 346 | —  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets | — | — | 5 | —  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration | — | 82 | (554 | ) | (923 | )  \nAdjusted net loss | $ | (1,440 | ) | $ | (1,103 | ) | $ | (5,304 | ) | $ | (6,420 | )  \nNet loss per share, basic and diluted | $ | (0.11 | ) | $ | (0.15 | ) | $ | (0.40 | ) | $ | (0.52 | )  \nAdjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted | $ | (0.11 | ) | $ | (0.09 | ) | $ | (0.42 | ) | $ | (0.52 | )  \nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share and adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted | 12,688,850 | 12,480,830 | 12,750,664 | 12,320,119  \n  \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \nGAAP net loss | $ | (1,440 | ) | $ | (1,874 | ) | $ | (5,101 | ) | $ | (6,361 | )  \n_Less:_  \nInterest (income) expense, net | (7 | ) | 42 | 176 | (64 | )  \nIncome taxes | 319 | 299 | 667 | 643  \nDepreciation, amortization and impairment | 2,561 | 2,475 | 7,974 | 8,126  \nRestructuring expense | — | — | 346 | —  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets | — | — | 5 | —  \nStock-based compensation expense | 3,054 | 2,573 | 9,127 | 7,272  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration | — | 82 | (554 | ) | (923 | )  \nAcquisition-related expenses | — | 689 | — | 864  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 4,487 | $ | 4,286 | $ | 12,640 | $ | 9,557  \n  \n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to statements regarding the company’s expectations for its estimated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 and 2025, driving diversified growth, strengthening its balance sheet and enhancing operational efficiencies for long-term success, continued momentum into Q4 and 2025, expanding public and private market opportunities ahead, its ability to achieve revenue growth and enhanced profitability in 2025 and beyond, its long-term financial targets, ability to drive profitable growth and build upon existing contracts and partnerships, including in the United States and internationally, operating momentum, financial visibility, sales pipeline, revenue growth, operating leverage and margin expansion.

* Revenues increased 10% to $26.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * Gross profit increased 11% to $15.2 million (58% of revenues), compared to $13.8 million (57% of revenues) for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss totaled $1.4 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.9 million for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 increased approximately 5% to $4.5 million (17% of revenues), compared to $4.3 million (18% of revenues) for the same quarter of 2023.\n  * ShotSpotter went “live” in four new cities and one university as well as expanded

for approximately $4.0 million as part of an existing $25 million share repurchase program.\n  * Improved cash and cash equivalents position to over $15 million dollars, after accounting for share repurchases. \n\n\n\n1 _See the section below titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to GAAP net income (loss)._\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“SoundThinking delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by 10% revenue growth, gross margin expansion and improving cash generation,” said President and CEO Ralph Clark. “Our third-quarter results, driven by new and expanding customer relationships, underscore the strength and versatility of our innovative SafetySmart™ platform. Our flagship ShotSpotter solution went ‘live’ in four new cities and one university, and expanded coverage in eight existing cities. We also saw robust momentum across our other SafetySmart solutions, with over 15 new customer implementations, reflecting our expanded market reach and growing demand.\n\n“We enhanced our SafePointe solution with upgraded AI-driven software and more powerful hardware components, improving its efficiency and reliability for customers. Additionally, we launched ‘PlateRanger, Powered by Rekor,’ an end-to-end vehicle and License Plate Reader (LPR) public safety solution that is already showing promising synergies and adding value for our customers.\n\n“We believe our focused execution on our strategic priorities is driving diversified growth, strengthening our balance sheet, and enhancing operational efficiencies for long-term success. We anticipate continued momentum into Q4 and 2025, and are energized by the expanding public and private market opportunities ahead.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $26.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the same quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to new and expanding customer subscriptions and contributions from SafePointe, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $15.2 million (58% of revenues), an improvement compared to $13.8 million (57% of revenues) for the same period in 2023.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $16.3 million, compared to $15.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher headcount and employee-related costs, including costs related to SafePointe, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $1.4 million, or $(0.11) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.7 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), compared to net loss of $1.9 million, or $(0.15) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.5 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), for the same period in 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $4.5 million, an increase compared to $4.3 million in the same period last year.\n\nAt quarter end, the company had $15.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $25.9 million in accounts receivable and contract assets, net, $49.5 million in deferred revenue, $4.0 million in debt related to borrowings to partially fund the SafePointe acquisition, and approximately $21.0 million available on its credit facility.\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nThe company reaffirmed its full-year 2024 revenue guidance range of $104.0 million to $106.0 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. The company also still expects Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18% to 20% for the full year 2024.\n\n“Despite the ongoing civic debate regarding the non-renewal of the ShotSpotter contract in Chicago and the loss of that contract with approximately $8.5 million in annual revenue, we remain confident in our ability to drive revenue growth and improve profitability in 2025 and beyond,” added Clark. As a result, we are providing our 2025 guidance as follows: We expect to achieve revenue in the range of $107.0 million to $109.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA between 19% and 21%.\n\nThe company’s financial outlook statements are based on current expectations. The preceding statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement” below. The company has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net income (loss) due to the uncertainty and variability of interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses, and acquisition-related expenses, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income (loss). Because the company cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort. Such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net income (loss). For more information, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nSoundThinking will hold a conference call today November 12, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results and provide an update on business conditions.\n\nSoundThinking management will host the presentation, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nU.S. dial-in: 1-877-407-8029International dial-in: 1-201-689-8029Conference ID: 13749551\n\nA live audio webcast of the conference call will be available in listen-only mode simultaneously and available for replay via the investor relations section of the company’s website at [www.soundthinking.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LCTGdxK_iHutB_s69PlOXglRSqhfKmb75Mjvjzf5A_HF3czPJwB6etFI9wWJog0uPzwtWqDvCVFddXbC0frxilY_Jk8QdvAyznHUg8L6EIY= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management internally to understand and evaluate the company’s core operating performance and trends across accounting periods and in connection with developing future operating plans, making strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and considering initiatives focused on cultivating new markets for its solutions. In particular, the exclusion of these expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of the company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis.\n\nSoundThinking believes adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA also provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. For example, SoundThinking adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses because such expenses often vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in a particular period. Stock-based compensation is utilized by SoundThinking to attract and retain employees with a goal of long-term retention and the alignment of employee interests with those of the company and its stockholders, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period’s financial performance measures, in particular net income (loss), or its other GAAP financial results.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net loss, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \nGAAP net loss | $ | (1,440 | ) | $ | (1,874 | ) | $ | (5,101 | ) | $ | (6,361 | )  \n_Less:_  \nAcquisition-related expenses | — | 689 | — | 864  \nRestructuring expense | — | — | 346 | —  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets | — | — | 5 | —  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration | — | 82 | (554 | ) | (923 | )  \nAdjusted net loss | $ | (1,440 | ) | $ | (1,103 | ) | $ | (5,304 | ) | $ | (6,420 | )  \nNet loss per share, basic and diluted | $ | (0.11 | ) | $ | (0.15 | ) | $ | (0.40 | ) | $ | (0.52 | )  \nAdjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted | $ | (0.11 | ) | $ | (0.09 | ) | $ | (0.42 | ) | $ | (0.52 | )  \nWeighted-average shares used in computing net loss per share and adjusted net loss per share, basic and diluted | 12,688,850 | 12,480,830 | 12,750,664 | 12,320,119  \n  \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** | **(Unaudited)**  \nGAAP net loss | $ | (1,440 | ) | $ | (1,874 | ) | $ | (5,101 | ) | $ | (6,361 | )  \n_Less:_  \nInterest (income) expense, net | (7 | ) | 42 | 176 | (64 | )  \nIncome taxes | 319 | 299 | 667 | 643  \nDepreciation, amortization and impairment | 2,561 | 2,475 | 7,974 | 8,126  \nRestructuring expense | — | — | 346 | —  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets | — | — | 5 | —  \nStock-based compensation expense | 3,054 | 2,573 | 9,127 | 7,272  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration | — | 82 | (554 | ) | (923 | )  \nAcquisition-related expenses | — | 689 | — | 864  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 4,487 | $ | 4,286 | $ | 12,640 | $ | 9,557  \n  \n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to statements regarding the company’s expectations for its estimated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 and 2025, driving diversified growth, strengthening its balance sheet and enhancing operational efficiencies for long-term success, continued momentum into Q4 and 2025, expanding public and private market opportunities ahead, its ability to achieve revenue growth and enhanced profitability in 2025 and beyond, its long-term financial targets, ability to drive profitable growth and build upon existing contracts and partnerships, including in the United States and internationally, operating momentum, financial visibility, sales pipeline, revenue growth, operating leverage and margin expansion.

(Nasdaq:\nSSTI), a leading public safety technology company, today reported financial results for the\nthird quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights\nRevenues increased 10% to $26.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the same\nquarter of 2023.\nGross profit increased 11% to $15.2 million (58% of revenues), compared to $13.8\nmillion (57% of revenues) for the same quarter of 2023.\nGAAP net loss totaled $1.4 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.9 million for the\nsame quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA1 increased approximately 5% to $4.5 million (17% of revenues),\ncompared to $4.3 million (18% of revenues) for the same quarter of 2023.\nShotSpotter went “live” in four new cities and one university as well as expanded with\neight current cities.\nEnhanced AI-driven software, upgraded hardware components, and initiated SOC2\nand HIPAA certification processes for SafePointe, an advanced weapons detection\nsolution.\nSecured a three-year agreement to expand ShotSpotter coverage in Montevideo,\nUruguay, doubling deployment footprint in the capital city.\nRepurchased 284,790 shares of common stock for approximately $4.0 million as part\nof an existing $25 million share repurchase program.\nImproved cash and cash equivalents position to over $15 million dollars, after\naccounting for share repurchases.\n1 See the section below titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about\nAdjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to GAAP net income (loss).\nManagement Commentary\n“SoundThinking delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by 10% revenue growth, gross\nmargin expansion and improving cash generation,” said President and CEO Ralph Clark.\n“Our third-quarter results, driven by new and expanding customer relationships, underscore\nthe strength and versatility of our innovative SafetySmart™ platform. Our flagship\nShotSpotter solution went ‘live’ in four new cities and one university, and expanded coverage\nin eight existing cities. We also saw robust momentum across our other SafetySmart\nsolutions, with over 15 new customer implementations, reflecting our expanded market\nreach and growing demand.\n“We enhanced our SafePointe solution with upgraded AI-driven software and more powerful\nhardware components, improving its efficiency and reliability for customers. Additionally, we\nlaunched ‘PlateRanger, Powered by Rekor,’ an end-to-end vehicle and License Plate\nReader (LPR) public safety solution that is already showing promising synergies and adding\nvalue for our customers.\n“We believe our focused execution on our strategic priorities is driving diversified growth,\nstrengthening our balance sheet, and enhancing operational efficiencies for long-term\nsuccess. We anticipate continued momentum into Q4 and 2025, and are energized by the\nexpanding public and private market opportunities ahead.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $26.3 million, compared to $24.0 million for the\nsame quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to new and expanding\ncustomer subscriptions and contributions from SafePointe, which was acquired in the third\nquarter of 2023.\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $15.2 million (58% of revenues), an\nimprovement compared to $13.8 million (57% of revenues) for the same period in 2023.\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $16.3 million, compared to $15.2\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to\nhigher headcount and employee-related costs, including costs related to SafePointe, which\nwas acquired in the third quarter of 2023.\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $1.4 million, or $(0.11) per basic and diluted\nshare (based on 12.7 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding),\ncompared to net loss of $1.9 million, or $(0.15) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.5\nmillion basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), for the same period in 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $4.5 million, an increase compared to\n$4.3 million in the same period last year.\nAt quarter end, the company had $15.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $25.9 million in\naccounts receivable and contract assets, net, $49.5 million in deferred revenue, $4.0 million\nin debt related to borrowings to partially fund the SafePointe acquisition, and approximately\n$21.0 million available on its credit facility.\nFinancial Outlook\nThe company reaffirmed its full-year 2024 revenue guidance range of $104.0 million to\n$106.0 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. The company also\nstill expects Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18% to 20% for the full year 2024.\n“Despite the ongoing civic debate regarding the non-renewal of the ShotSpotter contract in\nChicago and the loss of that contract with approximately $8.5 million in annual revenue, we\nremain confident in our ability to drive revenue growth and improve profitability in 2025 and\nbeyond,” added Clark. As a result, we are providing our 2025 guidance as follows: We\nexpect to achieve revenue in the range of $107.0 million to $109.0 million and Adjusted\nEBITDA between 19% and 21%.\nThe company’s financial outlook statements are based on current expectations. The\npreceding statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially\ndepending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement”\nbelow. The company has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net income\n(loss) due to the uncertainty and variability of interest income (expense), income taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses, and acquisition-related\nexpenses, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income\n(loss). Because the company cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation to\nforecasted GAAP net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort. Such items\ncould have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net income (loss). For more\ninformation, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nConference Call\nSoundThinking will hold a conference call today November 12, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern\nTime (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results and provide an update on business\nconditions.\nSoundThinking management will host the presentation, followed by a question-and-answer\nperiod.\nU.S. dial-in: 1-877-407-8029\nInternational dial-in: 1-201-689-8029\nConference ID: 13749551\nA live audio webcast of the conference call will be available in listen-only mode\nsimultaneously and available for replay via the investor relations section of the company’s\nwebsite at www.soundthinking.com.\nPlease call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time.

Adjusted\nEBITDA is a measure used by management internally to understand and evaluate the\ncompany’s core operating performance and trends across accounting periods and in\nconnection with developing future operating plans, making strategic decisions regarding the\nallocation of capital and considering initiatives focused on cultivating new markets for its\nsolutions. In particular, the exclusion of these expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA\nfacilitates comparisons of the company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis.\nSoundThinking believes adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA also provide\nuseful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating\nresults in the same manner as its management and board of directors. For example,\nSoundThinking adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-\nrelated expenses because such expenses often vary for reasons that are generally unrelated\nto financial and operational performance in a particular period.
