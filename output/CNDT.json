Our Commercial segment continued to exhibit enhanced performance helping to offset a sales lag in our Government segment. We added several new leaders to our senior team which, when accompanied by continued sequential momentum, will help us finish the year strong.”\n\n“We described a course of action and a set of expectations early in 2023, and we continue to hit our 'marks' along the way remaining exactly in line with that previously committed growth trajectory and sequentially expanding margins. Importantly, while our 2024 program of divestitures is complete with transition activities in place, our portfolio remains broad and we continue to see opportunities to further maximize shareholder return.”\n\n**Key Financial Q3 2024 Results**\n\n**($ in millions, except margin and per share data)** | **Q3 2024** | **Q3 2023** | **Current Quarter Y/Y B/(W)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nRevenue | $807 | $932 | (13.4)%  \nAdjusted Revenue(1) | $781 | $831 | (6.0)%  \nGAAP Net Income (Loss) | $123 | $(289) | n/m  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1) | $32 | $60 | (46.7)%  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (1) | 4.1% | 7.2% | (310) bps  \nGAAP Income (Loss) Before Income Tax | $159 | $(313) | n/m  \nGAAP Diluted EPS | $0.72 | $(1.34) | n/m  \nAdjusted Diluted EPS(1) | $(0.14) | $(0.09) | (55.6)%  \nCash Flow from Operating Activities | $(13) | $(11) | (18.2)%  \nAdjusted Free Cash Flow(1) | $(6) | $(35) | 82.9%  \n  \n**Performance Commentary** During the third quarter of 2024, the company completed the sale of the Casualty Claims Solutions business, receiving $224 million in cash consideration subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\n\nAlso, during the third quarter of 2024, the company used a portion of the proceeds from the divested businesses to voluntarily prepay the entire remaining outstanding balance of $38 million of the Term Loan B and $37 million of the Term Loan A.\n\nPre-tax income (loss) for the third quarter of 2024 was $159 million versus $(313) million in the prior year period. This increase is primarily driven by the gain on the sale of the Casualty Claims Solutions business and a goodwill impairment in the prior year period.\n\nThe third quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $32 million and Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 4.1% exceeded the company's expectations and was sequentially higher than the prior quarter.\n\nRevenue and Adjusted Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 were also in line with the company's expectations.\n\nConduent's liquidity position remains strong with long-dated debt maturities and a modest net leverage ratio.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the company repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares of its common stock in connection with its previously approved $75 million share repurchase program, which has now been completed.\n\n**Additional Q3 2024 Performance Highlights**\n\nConduent achieved several milestones in technology-led solutions, operational excellence and culture, including:\n\n  * Appointed a new Group President of the Commercial segment and a new President of Government Solutions;\n  * Achieved Leader status across all five categories in the NelsonHall 2024 NEAT Report for Healthcare Payer Operational Transformation;\n  * Named \"Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion\" for third consecutive year;\n  * Recognized by Forbes for fourth consecutive year as one of America's Best Employers for Diversity;\n  * Announced open payments fare collection for Venice and Paris regions allowing transit passengers to pay with contactless credit/debit cards and digital wallets. 22 cities now use Conduent open payments for transit;\n  * Received a contract award from the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families to design, develop and implement a modernized child support system to transform service delivery for children and families across the state; and\n  * Awarded a new three-year contract with a leading global logistics provider for our FastCap® Finance Analytics solution.\n\n\n\n**FY 2024 Outlook**(2,3)\n\n**FY 2023****Actuals** | **FY 2024****Outlook****(2,3)**  \n---|---  \n**Adj.

In addition, we have discussed our financial results using non-GAAP measures. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related tax effects. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the results of the current period against the corresponding prior period. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable U.S. GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management regularly uses our non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. Providing such non-GAAP financial measures to investors allows for a further level of transparency as to how management reviews and evaluates our business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on certain of these non-GAAP measures. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section attached to this release for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and their reconciliation to the reported U.S. GAAP measures.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release, any exhibits or attachments to this release, and other public statements we make may contain \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The metric annualizes the net impact to revenue. Timing of revenue impact varies and may not be realized within the forward 12-month timeframe. The metric is for indicative purposes only. This metric excludes non-recurring revenue signings. This metric is not indicative of any specific 12 month timeframe.\n\n**New Business Annual Contract Value (ACV):** (New Business TCV / contract term) multiplied by 12.\n\n**New Business Total Contract Value (TCV):** Estimated total future revenues from contracts signed during the period related to new logo, new service line or expansion with existing customers.\n\n**TTM:** Trailing twelve months.\n\n**PBT:** Profit before tax.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe have reported our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using non-GAAP measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related tax effects. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the results of the current period against the corresponding prior period. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable U.S. GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management regularly uses our non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions, and providing such non-GAAP financial measures to investors allows for a further level of transparency as to how management reviews and evaluates our business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on certain of these non-GAAP measures.\n\nManagement cautions that amounts presented in accordance with Conduent's definition of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.\n\nA reconciliation of the following non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP are provided below.\n\nThese reconciliations also include the income tax effects for our non-GAAP performance measures in total, to the extent applicable. The income tax effects are calculated under the same accounting principles as applied to our reported pre-tax performance measures under Accounting Standards Codification 740, which employs an annual effective tax rate method. The noted income tax effect for our non-GAAP performance measures is effectively the difference in income taxes for reported and adjusted pre-tax income calculated under the annual effective tax rate method. The tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments was calculated based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable statutory tax rate in the jurisdictions in which such charges were incurred.\n\n**Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Profit Before Tax, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding, and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate**\n\nWe make adjustments to Net Income (Loss) before Income Taxes for the following items, as applicable, to the particular financial measure, for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Profit Before Tax, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding, and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate:\n\n  * Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization of acquired intangible assets is driven by acquisition activity, which can vary in size, nature and timing as compared to other companies within our industry and from period to period.\n  * Restructuring and related costs. Restructuring and related costs include restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as costs associated with our strategic transformation program.\n  * Goodwill impairment. This represents goodwill impairment charges related to entering the agreement to transfer the BenefitWallet portfolio.\n  * (Gain) loss on divestitures and transaction costs, net. Represents (gain) loss on divested businesses and transaction costs.\n  * Litigation settlements (recoveries), net represents settlements or recoveries for various matters subject to litigation.\n  * Loss on extinguishment of debt. This represents write-off related debt issuance costs related to prepayments of debt.\n  * Other charges (credits). This includes Other (income) expenses, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (loss) and other insignificant (income) expenses and other adjustments.\n  * Divestitures. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of divested businesses are excluded.\n\n\n\nThe company provides adjusted net income and adjusted EPS financial measures to assist our investors in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods, by adjusting for certain items which may be recurring or non-recurring and which in our view do not necessarily reflect ongoing performance. We also internally use these measures to assess our operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions.\n\nManagement believes that the adjusted effective tax rate, provided as supplemental information, facilitates a comparison by investors of our actual effective tax rate with an adjusted effective tax rate which reflects the impact of the items which are excluded in providing adjusted net income and certain other identified items, and may provide added insight into our underlying business results and how effective tax rates impact our ongoing business.\n\n**Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin**\n\nWe make adjustments to Costs and Expenses and Operating Margin for the following items, as applicable, for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin:\n\n  * Amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n  * Restructuring and related costs.\n  * Interest expense. Interest expense includes interest on long-term debt and amortization of debt issuance costs.\n  * Goodwill impairment.\n  * Loss on extinguishment of debt.\n  * (Gain) loss on divestitures and transaction costs, net.\n  * Litigation settlements (recoveries), net.\n  * Other charges (credits).\n  * Divestitures.\n\n\n\nWe provide our investors with adjusted revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin information, as supplemental information, because we believe it offers added insight, by itself and for comparability between periods, by adjusting for certain non-cash items as well as certain other identified items which we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing business, and may also provide added insight on trends in our ongoing business.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA Margin**\n\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as an additional way of assessing certain aspects of our operations that, when viewed with the U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our on-going business. Adjusted EBITDA represents income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and contract inducement amortization adjusted for the following items. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue or adjusted revenue, as applicable.\n\n  * Restructuring and related costs.\n  * Goodwill impairment.\n  * Loss on extinguishment of debt.\n  * (Gain) loss on divestitures and transaction costs, net.\n  * Litigation settlements (recoveries), net.\n  * Other charges (credits).\n  * Divestitures.\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows from operations, operating income (loss) or net income (loss) as defined by U.S. GAAP as indicators of operating performance.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities as reported on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows, less cost of additions to land, buildings and equipment, cost of additions to internal use software, and proceeds from sales of land, buildings and equipment. We use the non-GAAP measure of Free Cash Flow as a criterion of liquidity. We use Free Cash Flow as a measure of liquidity to determine amounts we can reinvest in our core businesses, such as amounts available to make acquisitions and invest in land, buildings and equipment and internal use software, after required payments on debt. In order to provide a meaningful basis for comparison, we are providing information with respect to our Free Cash Flow reconciled to cash flow provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the most directly comparable measure under U.S. GAAP.\n\n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow**\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as Free Cash Flow from above plus adjustments for litigation insurance recoveries, transaction costs, taxes paid on gains from divestitures and litigation recoveries, proceeds from failed sale-leaseback transactions and certain other identified adjustments. We use Adjusted Free Cash Flow, in addition to Free Cash Flow, to provide supplemental information to our investors concerning our ability to generate cash from our ongoing operating activities; by excluding these items, we believe we provide useful additional information to our investors to help them further understand our ability to generate cash period-over-period as well as added information on comparability to our competitors. Such as with Free Cash Flow information, as so adjusted, it is specifically not intended to provide amounts available for discretionary spending. We have added certain adjustments to account for items which we do not believe reflect our core business or operating performance, and we computed all periods with such adjusted costs.\n\n**Revenue at Constant Currency**\n\nTo better understand trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to adjust revenue to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. We refer to this adjusted revenue as “constant currency.” Currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. This currency impact is calculated by translating the current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior-year period's currency translation rate.\n\n**Non-GAAP Outlook**\n\nIn providing the Full Year 2024 outlook for Adjusted EBITDA Margin we exclude certain items which are otherwise included in determining the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. A description of the adjustments which historically have been applicable in determining Adjusted EBITDA Margin is reflected in the table below. We are providing such outlook only on a non-GAAP basis because the company is unable without unreasonable efforts to predict with reasonable certainty the totality or ultimate outcome or occurrence of these adjustments for the forward-looking period, which can be dependent on future events that may not be reliably predicted. Based on past reported results, where one or more of these items have been applicable, such excluded items could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to reported results. We have provided an outlook for Adjusted Revenue only on a non-GAAP basis using foreign currency translation rates as of current period end due to the inability to, without unreasonable efforts, accurately predict foreign currency impact on revenues. Full Year 2024 Outlook for Adjusted Free Cash Flow is provided as a factor of expected Adjusted EBITDA, and such outlook is only available on a non-GAAP basis for the reasons described above. For the same reason, we are unable to provide a GAAP expected adjusted tax rate, which adjusts for our non-GAAP adjustments.\n\n**Non-GAAP Reconciliations:** Adjusted Revenue, Revenue at Constant

You have to build trust with an individual to encourage them to change behaviors. We know ALEX is having an impact that translates into tangible results. Employee reports show they are making more preventative healthcare appointments, are better able to meet their health goals, and almost 90% say they understand their benefits more after talking with ALEX,” said Brian Meager, President of Jellyvision. \n\n“Once employees have selected their health plan, they are often confused about how to optimize their benefits. TALON’s data shows a huge opportunity to help employees save on out-of-pocket healthcare expenses,” said Mark Galvin, CEO at TALON. “By providing employees with the ability to comparison shop means they are getting real and measurable benefits. For instance, employees who searched and shopped for various blood tests saved as much as 95% off the highest-cost in-network provider and over 25% compared to employees who didn’t shop.” \n\n[Health and wellness administration](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.conduent.com%2Fhuman-capital-solutions%2Fhealth-benefit-solutions%2Femployee-benefits%2F&esheet=54146126&newsitemid=20241104761667&lan=en-US&anchor=Health+and+wellness+administration&index=6&md5=a0d7730748210b6aa2fbfd0ee5000e8f) provider Conduent, [benefits advisor](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jellyvision.com%2F&esheet=54146126&newsitemid=20241104761667&lan=en-US&anchor=benefits+advisor&index=7&md5=2ddbe31da5bace121e39464f935ecf1d) ALEX from Jellyvision and TALON’s [health care price transparency platform](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftalonhealthtech.com%2Fhealthcare-price-transparency-platform%2F&esheet=54146126&newsitemid=20241104761667&lan=en-US&anchor=health+care+price+transparency+platform&index=8&md5=4786d3acef43b6f9e5402292d5006033) can enable better health and wellness outcomes for employees with solutions that align budget, benefits strategy and goals. \n\n**About Conduent**\n\nConduent delivers digital business solutions and services spanning the commercial, government and transportation spectrum – creating valuable outcomes for its clients and the millions of people who count on them.
