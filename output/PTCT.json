We are on our way to accomplishing all of our 2024 objectives and are in a strong financial position to execute on our long-term strategic plans.\" \n\n**Key Corporate Updates:**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 total revenue of $197 million\n  * Third quarter 2024 revenue for the DMD franchise was $124 million\n    * Translarna™ (ataluren) net product revenue was $72 million, driven by continued access for patients in existing geographies, continued geographic expansion, high compliance and adherence, and dose adjustments.\n    * Emflaza® (deflazacort) net product revenue was $52 million, driven by new patient starts, continued brand loyalty, high compliance and adherence, and dose adjustments.\n\n\n\n**Key Clinical and Regulatory Milestones:**\n\n  * PTC submitted an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU. The file was accepted for review, and the regulatory action date is set for July 29, 2025.\n  * PTC resubmitted the NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD; the file was accepted, and a regulatory action date was not provided.\n  * The BLA for PTC's gene therapy for AADC deficiency remains on schedule for a regulatory action date of November 13, 2024.\n  * PTC received Fast Track Designation for the PTC518 Huntington's disease program.\n  * PTC plans to submit an NDA for vatiquinone for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia in December 2024.\n  * PTC expects to share topline data for the CardinALS trial of utreloxastat for the treatment of ALS in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Total revenues were $196.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $196.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Total revenue includes net product revenue across the commercial portfolio of $135.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $144.0 million for the third quarter of 2023.

In particular, the non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense financial measures exclude non-cash, stock-based compensation expense.

(NASDAQ: PTCT) today announced that the global Phase 2 placebo-controlled CardinALS study did not meet its primary endpoint of slowing disease progression on the composite ALSFRS-R and mortality analysis. While there was modest numerical benefit recorded on the primary endpoint and correlation of favorable clinical effect with lowering of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker of neuronal damage, statistical significance was not achieved (p= 0.52). In addition, significance was not achieved on the secondary efficacy endpoints.\n\n\"We wish to thank all of the patients, their families and physicians who participated in the CardinALS trial,\" said Matthew B. Klein, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, PTC Therapeutics. \"We are of course disappointed that we were not able to demonstrate treatment efficacy and provide a potential therapy that could address the significant unmet medical need of ALS patients.\"\n\nUtreloxastat was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in the CardinALS trial. However, due to the lack of efficacy and biomarker signal, further development is not planned at this time.\n\n**About Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)** Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, sometimes referred to as ALS, motor neuron disease, or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare, progressive, and fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord.1,2 ALS becomes life-threatening as people with this disease ultimately lose the ability to move, speak, eat, and breathe.1\n\n**About PTC Therapeutics, Inc.**PTC is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated medicines that provide benefits to children and adults living with rare disorders.
