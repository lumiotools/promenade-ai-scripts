(“SHI” or the “Company”), (NASDAQ: SLNH), a developer of green data centers for intensive computing applications including Bitcoin mining and AI, announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nJohn Belizaire, CEO of Soluna, said, “Soluna continues to move at a fast pace and has achieved several important milestones this quarter including, launching our Soluna Cloud AI business and strategic partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE), securing financing for our Project Dorothy expansion and breaking ground and securing $25 million of growth capital. Project Kati has reached several important milestones and Project Rosa is accelerating with the signing of Term Sheets for power and land this quarter. Our financial results continue to build strongly with the company achieving its highest third quarter year-to-date revenue, $29.7 million.”\n\nSoluna is on a mission to make renewable energy a global superpower, using computing as a catalyst. The company designs, develops, and operates digital infrastructure that transforms surplus renewable energy into scalable computing resources. Soluna’s data centers are strategically co-located with wind, solar, and hydroelectric power plants to support high-performance computing applications, including Bitcoin mining, generative AI, and other compute-intensive tasks.\n\nSoluna ensures seamless integration with renewable energy power plants, providing cost-effective and sustainable computing solutions while providing the flexible load required for a greener grid. The Company now operates through three core subsidiary businesses:\n\n  * **Soluna Digital (“Digital”)** – Bitcoin Hosting and Proprietary mining business that builds, owns, and operates its modular, behind-the-meter, data centers delivering managed infrastructure to hyperscale miners. Digital develops data centers co-located with renewable energy projects.\n  * **Soluna Cloud (“Cloud”) –** Soluna’s [GPU cloud ](http://solunalcloud.com)business [provides services for generative AI](http://solunalcloud.com) and colocation services for HPC and enterprise AI workloads. Soluna’s Cloud develops behind-the-meter data centers co-located with renewable energy projects.\n  * **Soluna Energy (“Energy”) –** Signs power purchase agreements and leases or acquires land in partnership with renewable energy power producers. It has more than 2.6 GW of a long-term pipeline and delivers grid ancillary services in collaboration with Soluna Digital.\n\n\n\nThis integrated approach positions Soluna to leverage renewable energy as a global superpower, transforming surplus energy into valuable computing resources across AI, digital assets, and grid services.\n\nBelizaire continued, “Another tangible sign of Soluna’s growth trajectory is the significant expansion of our development pipeline, which is now more than 2.6 GW with 1.2 GW currently in active Term Sheet negotiations. This demonstrates a core competence of the company – our ability to find, evaluate, and secure access to renewable power that is suited to development into data centers for High-Performance Computing/AI and Bitcoin computing with industry-leading costs.”\n\n### **Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * **Enterprise AI Services with HPE –** Soluna Cloud [partnered with HPE](https://www.solunacomputing.com/news/soluna-announces-sustainable-ai-soluna-cloud-supported-by-hewlett-packard-enterprise/) to make 512 H100 SXM GPUs available, boosting support for generative AI workloads.\n  * **$30 million Expansion and Groundbreaking of Project Dorothy 2 –** $30 million [funding secured from Spring Lane Capital](https://www.solunacomputing.com/news/soluna-closes-30m-funding-from-spring-lane-capital-for-project-dorothy-2/) for a 48 MW expansion of Project Dorothy, Soluna’s flagship behind-the-meter data center.

It is very complicated.**\n\nOn its face, it may seem complicated but in reality, it is a straight-forward $25M Standby-Equity Purchase Agreement (SEPA) facility.\n\nThe Pre-paid advances you find in the documents were there in case we decided to draw against them, which we didn’t. \n\nSoluna may request advances at any time against the $25M remaining SEPA until a total of $25M has been received at which point the SEPA terminates. We can do this as soon as the registration statement (S-1) that we’ve filed becomes effective which should be soon.\n\n### **Why did you do this deal? Why did you select YA?**\n\nThis deal delivers flexible capital at a reasonable cost of capital without warrants and other complex features which both simplify and strengthen our capital table and improve our access to capital to grow. Yorkville presented an attractive deal structure relative to other financing partners we considered and has financed companies similar to Soluna with similar deals that have yielded exactly the result we are looking for.\n\n### **Why was it a priority to repay the Convertible Note?**\n\nThe Convertible Notes, although a good source of capital several years ago when the company needed it, have proven to have been complex and unpredictably dilutive for the company and its shareholders. A simpler structure is in the company’s and our shareholders’ best interest.\n\n### **Why did you restructure the Preferred B?**\n\nThe Preferred B had significant consent, right of first refusal, and participation rights that are not aligned with our growing company’s financing strategy. To secure waivers of these rights and consent to the Yorkville deal, it made sense to restructure in a way that gives us a mutually beneficial path forward.\n\n### **Why would you buy debt in your own AI subsidiary? Please explain the series of transactions where you buy debt from Alpha and Fidelis. What does it mean? What is the effect?**\n\nSoluna buying Cloud notes enabled Soluna to deploy cash to Cloud in a secured format that increases future flexibility to convert to a higher equity position or access cash from Cloud sooner/easier and secured consent to the Yorkville deal.\n\n### **How many shares of stock will you issue to YA? Over what period of time?**\n\nThe YA transaction will result in a number of shares over time via draws that we initiate against the SEPA. For example, if we were to raise $5m over a period of time at an average of $5/share purchase price, we would sell 1.0M shares of stock to Yorkville.\n\n### **Do you think that this much share issuance will depress the share price?**\n\nIt is difficult to predict share price – but it is important to understand that YA’s returns on its capital come via share price appreciation. Their goal is for our share price to continue to increase each time that we draw on the SEPA. That aligns with our goals to continue to grow as a company. This is one of the aspects of this deal that we like – the alignment of interests between our lender and the company.\n\n### **Why do you need to raise “up to” $25 million from equity sales?**\n\nWe are a growing company and will continue to have accretive and profitable opportunities related to the development of and investment in our data center projects and AI. Access to capital at a reasonable cost that is flexible and available when and if we need it is an advantage of this deal and one of the reasons we selected this structure and Yorkville as a partner. Our projects generate high returns on invested capital that will benefit shareholders.

Soluna Cloud will house our GPU Cloud and Co-location businesses.As AI takes hold in the enterprise there will be increasing demand for sustainable, scalable resources for aI training, tuning, and inference.We aim to be a key player in this vibrant ecosystem.\n\n### Stephen asked: Based on your public announcements there appears to be a solid pipeline of energy supply opportunities for Soluna to tap into. What is your projected growth rate (online AI/BTC MW) over the next 12 months? What are the main elements that will impact the growth rate on future data center / BTC projects?\n\nIndeed our pipeline is growing.Our current goal is to more than double the number of MW’s operating to >150MW at the end of this year/early next year, driven primarily by the energization of Project Dorothy 2 and more Soluna Cloud projects.Our growth rate has been constrained by access to capital, but as you can see via recent announcements, we are accelerating the pace of development and size of projects successfully and look forward to sharing additional news on this in due course.\n\n### Frank asked: I’ve heard AI requires 100% uptime. How will you guys be able to sustain that?\n\nThere are actually multiple stages of the AI lifecycle. Training, Tuning, and Inference – some of which indeed require near 100% uptime and others that can be batchable.The training and fine tuning phases, specifically, are particularly well suited to compute environments that have less than 100% uptime – where a tradeoff to secure industry leading power and infrastructure cost (which is what Soluna is uniquely positioned to deliver) can easily be made.The innovation we are focusing on is placing this batchable portion of AI at renewable energy projects to deliver sustainable, scalable, and cost effective digital infrastructure to enterprises who care deeply about the ESG implications of AI.\n\n### Andrew asked: When will you resume the preferred dividend payments?\n\nAs we communicated in an earlier AMA, the Board continues to carefully evaluate the Company’s current and prospective financial and operating results as well as the interests of all of its equity holders when making a determination to pay or accrue its Series A Preferred dividends.\n\n### Anonymous asked: Can you briefly provide an overview of the various share classifications (preference shares type A & B) and provide the impact to the company in terms of conversion price?And, in terms of dividends, can you confirm what the level is payable for each class of preference shares and how and when they are paid/accrued?\n\nPreferred A Series are perpetual, have a liquidation preference face value of $25/share, are not convertible, carry a 9% dividend on the face value which is currently being accrued, has no conversion right or price, and are paid upon a change of control at the lesser of the sum of accrued dividends plus face value or the share value. (conversion share value resets upon stock splits/reverse splits)\n\nPreferred B Series may be redeemed if no Preferred A Series shares are outstanding after Convertible Notes have been retired and the 3rd anniversary date has passed (which occurs in 2025), have the same liquidation preference as Preferred Series A, carry a 10% dividend, which is $625,000, and is paid annually, and may be converted to shares of Common Equity at a conversion price of $27/share and are paid upon a change of control as shares of Common Equity or converted into new Preferred Shares of the new entity.\n\n### Anonymous asked: When will the company have positive cash flow and EBITDA for more than 2 quarters in a row?\n\nAlthough we share forward looking statements from time to time regarding our projects and the company, we do not provide earnings or profit guidance that is specific.Your best resource is our Earnings Power Presentation that we update annually.The last update was in May of this year and is found [here](https://www.solunacomputing.com/investors/updates/2024-earnings-power-presentation/).\n\n### Anonymous asked: How has the Soluna Enterprise Value (EV) Changed?\n\nWe last shared an EV calculation via our update to the Introduction to Soluna Presentation on April 24, 2024 located [here](https://www.solunacomputing.com/investors/updates/introduction-to-soluna/).This showed the calculation through the end of 2023.Below you can see the significant progress that has been made, and value that has been created, through the end of June 2024 – an increase of ~$43m from $64m to $107m.\n\n![](https://www.solunacomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Soluna-EV-Chart.png)\n\nThank you for [**submitting your questions**](http://bit.ly/asksoluna)!\n\nIf you’re reading this and **haven’t had a chance to ask your question, it’s not too late.**\n\nFill out this [**form**](https://solunacomputing.typeform.com/questions)**,** or drop your questions on Twitter [**@SolunaHoldings**](http://twitter.com/solunaholdings)**,** to have your questions answered in our next AMA installment.\n\nIf your question wasn’t answered here, be sure to [**subscribe to our newsletter**](https://www.subscribepage.com/cleanintegration)**.** We’re providing business insights and answering questions there, too.\n\n### Related\n\n### blog\n\n![](https://www.solunacomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Core-Values-1024x682.jpeg)\n\n### [Core values that keep us focused.](https://www.solunacomputing.com/blog/core-values/)\n\nSeptember 9, 2019\n\n### blog\n\n![](https://www.solunacomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/testimony-1024x576.png)\n\n### [Cleaning Up Cryptocurrency: My Testimony Before Congress](https://www.solunacomputing.com/blog/congress-testimony/)\n\nJanuary 20, 2022\n\n### blog\n\n![](https://www.solunacomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/iStock-907280674-1-1024x628.jpg)\n\n### [ESG Doublespeak: Or, the Untold Story of Performance Measurement and Carbon Taxes](https://www.solunacomputing.com/blog/esg/)\n\nOctober 22, 2022\n\n[ ![Soluna](https://www.solunacomputing.com/wp-content/themes/soluna/new-assets/images/logo.svg) ](#)\n\n  * [ LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/solunaholdings)\n  * [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/SolunaHoldings)\n  * [ Medium ](https://medium.com/clean-integration)\n  * [ Apple Podcasts ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-kingdom-solunas-blockchain-podcast/id1420141999?mt=2)\n  * [ YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/c/SolunaComputing)\n  * [ Spotify ](https://open.spotify.com/show/7AcZL6rE2Q1XYkTdBngxp4?si=ab3615bff2584d6b)\n\n\n\n  * [About Us](#)\n    * [Company](/about)\n    * [Data Centers](/projects/)\n    * [News](/news)\n    * [Careers](/careers)\n  * [Solutions](#)\n    * [AI Cloud](/for-ai/)\n    * [Curtailment Solutions](/for-power-producers/)\n  * [Investors](/investors/)\n    * [Overview](/investors/)\n    * [Updates & Presentations](/investors/updates)\n    * [Financial Information](/investors/#intro)\n    * [Governance](/investors/#governance)\n  * [Resources](#)\n    * [Blog](/blogs/)\n    * [Podcast](/podcast/)\n    * [Video](/video/)\n    * [Research](/research/)\n    * [Media/Press](/press/)\n  * [Contact](/contact)\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2024 Soluna.

With this being the case, why is the company bothering to request that stockholders approve the action at the late May 2024 annual meeting which occurs after the action has been taken?**\n\nNASDAQ rules require the company to seek shareholder approval for any issuance of stock or warrants on stock that exceeds 20% of the currently issued stock. The 4th Amendment to the Convertible Note resulted in several warrants and conversion shares that exceeded this threshold, requiring a shareholder vote of approval.\n\n### **Doug asked: When do you forecast the resumption of dividends for your Series A Preferred stock?**\n\nThe Board continues to carefully evaluate the Company’s current and prospective financial and operating results as well as the interests of all of its equity holders when making a determination to pay or accrue its Series A Preferred dividends. \n\n### **Ameet asked: Are you able to unlock and monetize the environmental value via REC’s from your renewable energy generation assets?**\n\nSoluna contracts, via Power Purchase Agreements (PPA’s), with the power producer who generates these REC’s. We have the option to purchase REC’s to offset energy that we buy from the grid.\n\n### **Zach asked: What are the details behind the Dorothy 2 financing, including the management fees that will be paid to Soluna? How does the financing pipeline look for Project Kati?**\n\nWe look forward to sharing additional details about the Dorothy 2 financing once we announce the closing of the financing. It is a similar structure to Dorothy 1A, where Spring Lane Capital and Soluna will each own a share of the equity of the project which will host Bitcoin customers at the site. There will be developer and operator fees paid to Soluna. Details will be communicated in the future.\n\nIt is premature to discuss Project Kati financing, other than to say that we have begun the early engagement with potential financing partners, including equity and debt.\n\n### **Robin: Soluna announced 166 MW of hosting potential with Project Kati, what is the estimated total revenue gain from this project assuming Bitcoin stays around 65k?**\n\nDevelopment work continues on Project Kati, including customer mix and economics. We will not provide specific guidance on this project yet, but you could look at the economics of our flagship Project Dorothy to have an idea of the economics of our projects.\n\n### **Anonymous asked: Regarding the balance sheet and the preferred shares – can you give a summary of where you stand with those and how you are approaching those?**\n\nThe company has just returned to growth again and it feels good. Our goal is to invest cash into the growth of the company to drive earnings and continue to diversify our business. As this cash generation improves – as it has been lately – our board will consider what is the best use of those funds. We are focused on reducing our debt load as fast as we can; by restructuring the convertible notes. As for the preferred shares; we’ve come up with a few ideas here we are not ready to share yet. But, stay tuned. \n\nThank you for [**submitting your questions**](http://bit.ly/asksoluna)!\n\nIf you’re reading this and **haven’t had a chance to ask your question, it’s not too late.**\n\nFill out this [**form**](https://solunacomputing.typeform.com/questions)**,** or drop your questions on Twitter [**@SolunaHoldings**](http://twitter.com/solunaholdings)**,** to have your questions answered in our next AMA installment.\n\nIf your question wasn’t answered here, be sure to [**subscribe to our newsletter**](https://www.subscribepage.com/cleanintegration)**.** We’re providing business insights and answering questions there, too.\n\n### Related\n\n### blog\n\n![](https://www.solunacomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Soluna-CEO-1024x682.jpeg)\n\n### [Soluna CEO Michael Toporek Answers Investors’ Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.solunacomputing.com/blog/ama-toporek/)\n\nSeptember 1, 2022\n\n### blog\n\n![](https://www.solunacomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dignity-Through-Identity.jpeg)\n\n### [Dignity Through Identity](https://www.solunacomputing.com/blog/dignity-through-identity/)\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\n### blog\n\n![](https://www.solunacomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Soluna-C19-1024x576.png)\n\n### [Soluna in the Time of Coronavirus](https://www.solunacomputing.com/blog/covid/)\n\nMay 27, 2020\n\n[ ![Soluna](https://www.solunacomputing.com/wp-content/themes/soluna/new-assets/images/logo.svg) ](#)\n\n  * [ LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/solunaholdings)\n  * [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/SolunaHoldings)\n  * [ Medium ](https://medium.com/clean-integration)\n  * [ Apple Podcasts ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-kingdom-solunas-blockchain-podcast/id1420141999?mt=2)\n  * [ YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/c/SolunaComputing)\n  * [ Spotify ](https://open.spotify.com/show/7AcZL6rE2Q1XYkTdBngxp4?si=ab3615bff2584d6b)\n\n\n\n  * [About Us](#)\n    * [Company](/about)\n    * [Data Centers](/projects/)\n    * [News](/news)\n    * [Careers](/careers)\n  * [Solutions](#)\n    * [AI Cloud](/for-ai/)\n    * [Curtailment Solutions](/for-power-producers/)\n  * [Investors](/investors/)\n    * [Overview](/investors/)\n    * [Updates & Presentations](/investors/updates)\n    * [Financial Information](/investors/#intro)\n    * [Governance](/investors/#governance)\n  * [Resources](#)\n    * [Blog](/blogs/)\n    * [Podcast](/podcast/)\n    * [Video](/video/)\n    * [Research](/research/)\n    * [Media/Press](/press/)\n  * [Contact](/contact)\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2024 Soluna.
