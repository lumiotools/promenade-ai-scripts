(Nasdaq: CDAQ) (“CDAQ”), a special purpose acquisition company, have entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”). \n\nEEW is a global utility-scale renewable energy project developer with diversified operations across Europe and Australia. Since its founding in 2012, EEW has leveraged over a decade of experience to successfully develop approximately 1.5 GW of renewable energy projects. The Company operates a streamlined platform with specialized expertise in key renewable technologies, including solar PV, BESS, and green hydrogen development.\n\nEEW boasts a robust project pipeline totalling 9 GW, providing around 8x coverage of its 2024 sales forecast. The advanced-stage pipeline includes more than 300MW of Solar PV and over 1.5 GWh of BESS, positioning EEW to capitalize on the expanding global demand for renewable energy. The Company is strategically poised to benefit from large, growing addressable markets, driven by global climate initiatives, declining renewable energy costs, and rising energy demand.\n\nAs a pure-play developer, EEW has a natural advantage and a strategic vision to evolve into an IPP, enabling it to manage and operate select projects and capture recurring revenue. Upon closing of the transactions contemplated in the Business Combination Agreement (the “Proposed Business Combination”), the combined company is expected to list on Nasdaq, which could accelerate EEW’s growth trajectory, unlocking a multitude of new opportunities.\n\nEEW’s existing management team, led by CEO Svante Kumlin, will continue to lead the business after this transaction.\n\n**Svante Kumlin commented** : “Today’s business combination represents a significant milestone for EEW and enables us to continue to grow the business and capitalize on our significant existing project pipeline. Our team has demonstrated a strong track record of originating and developing utility-scale renewable energy projects globally and is committed to generating clean and renewable energy. This combination with CDAQ provides us with a partner that shares our vision for the future and secures our ability to continue executing our business plan. We are excited to collaborate with the CDAQ team and believe we are well-positioned to unlock new opportunities and significant value for our shareholders.”\n\n**Thomas Hennessy, CEO of CDAQ, added** : “We are pleased to announce our business combination with EEW, a premier global renewable energy project developer. Given CDAQ’s exclusive focus on category-defining businesses, CDAQ is the ideal strategic partner to help EEW accelerate its growth as a Nasdaq listed company and create long-term shareholder value. We have been impressed by EEW’s strategic vision, capable team and expansive global project pipeline that should provide investors with a compelling long-term opportunity.”\n\n**Proposed Business Combination Overview**\n\nThe Proposed Business Combination implies a pro forma combined enterprise value of $386 million, assuming $25 million total left from trust proceeds and transaction financing at $10.00 per share, excluding additional earnout consideration. The Proposed Business Combination is expected to deliver gross cash proceeds to EEW of approximately $25 million, through a combination of SPAC Trust proceeds and additional funding from one or more financing agreements with investors expected to be executed prior to the closing of the Proposed Business Combination.\n\nUnder the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, EEW’s existing shareholders will convert 100% of their equity ownership into the combined company and are expected to own approximately 79% of the post-combination company upon consummation of the Proposed Business Combination, inclusive of the additional earnout consideration and any third-party financing arrangements.\n\nThe Proposed Business Combination is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory and CDAQ stockholder approvals. The combined public company is expected to list its common stock and warrants to purchase common stock on Nasdaq, subject to approval of its listing application. The Proposed Business Combination has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both EEW and CDAQ.\n\nAdditional information about the Proposed Business Combination, including a copy of the Business Combination Agreement, will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by CDAQ with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and available at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZaP3uJKTES0v2z0WVvX0kdfJam3E78l-_nrHG7UmT-JaR-9Jhi6YyCYJHVszjlcUaRFEeHwlAOVURqrJ2H5ZOw==).\n\n**Advisors**\n\nCohen & Company Capital Markets, a division of J.V.B.

Moreover, EEW has an approximate 40% ownership in EEW H2, which focuses on developing green Hydrogen in Australia and North Africa.\n\nSince 2012, EEW has successfully sold 24 solar PV and BESS projects totaling approximately 1.5 GW in the UK, Australia, Spain and Sweden. The group now has a global solar, BESS and green hydrogen project pipeline of approximately 9 GW spanning Europe and Australia.

VI ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d5W-KaL3Zun__rRtA6UuSloeCizuyYH2wWIJ2jHkV7zhgPtU9oSI0vITMvAF12qoAi-Od4DpeWOq3uQDXzjMQfivTphJMsPcVo3Knoo-CZ4B4i6Advt0D_1Z7uznihHX)(Nasdaq: HCVI) (“HCVI”), a Nasdaq listed special purpose acquisition company, have entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”). The proposed business combination (the “Proposed Business Combination”) is expected to be completed (the “Closing”) in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder approvals. The combined public company (“PubCo”) is expected to be named “Namib Minerals” and to list its common stock and warrants to purchase common stock on Nasdaq under the new ticker symbols “NAMM” and “NAMMW”, respectively, subject to approval of its listing application.\n\nThe Proposed Business Combination consideration of approximately 50 million PubCo ordinary shares values Namib at a pre-money enterprise value of $500 million, with up to an additional 30 million PubCo ordinary shares tied to the completion of operational milestones, including the commercial production of the Mazowe and Redwing mines. The Proposed Business Combination is expected to deliver net proceeds to Namib of approximately $91 million, assuming no further redemptions by HCVI’s public stockholders, as well as approximately $60 million of additional funding from one or more financing agreements with investors expected to be executed prior to the Closing. As a result of the Proposed Business Combination, Namib expects to benefit from continued operational efficiency and cash flow generation from its producing How mine and the build-out of Namib’s multi-asset growth path. The Proposed Business Combination also represents the largest African deSPAC to date. Namib’s existing management team, led by Chief Executive Officer, Ibrahima Tall, will continue to lead the business after the Closing.\n\nNamib’s current producing asset, the How mine, is an established, high-grade, underground gold mine located near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. The How mine is currently generating cash flow alongside a strong history of production and one of the lowest reported production cost profiles amongst its peer group. The How mine has a strong track record of consistently operating within budget and maintains additional identified underground resources, which may contribute to extending its mine life.\n\nNamib also has an identified pathway to operate as a multi-asset producer in Africa, with growth plans underway to restart the Company’s previously producing Mazowe and Redwing gold mines, along with development potential in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to unlock battery metals in the region. To date, work has commenced across 13 granted exploration permits in the DRC and six initial holes have been drilled identifying copper and cobalt potential.\n\n**Ibrahima Tall, CEO** **of Namib, commented** : “Today represents a significant day and an exciting milestone for Namib. This business combination with HCVI will enable us to continue growing our business while helping us to realize the full potential of our mining asset portfolio. Namib is committed to creating an environment of safe, sustainable and profitable mining operations that supports the local communities we serve. This transaction provides us a partner in HCVI that shares our focus on sustainable growth and our goal to return as a multi-asset producer in Africa. We believe our established management team is well-positioned to unlock significant value for our shareholders, and we look forward to working closely with the HCVI team to make these aspirations a reality.”\n\n**Daniel Hennessy, Chairman and CEO of HCVI, added** : “We are extremely pleased to announce our business combination with Namib, an established gold-mining company in the sub-Saharan mining industry. HCVI was formed with the objectives of merging with an established and competitive company operating in the industrial or energy-transition sector. Namib stood out as a compelling partner due to its history of underground mining in precious metals, opportunities for future expansion and its mission to create safe, sustainable and profitable operations in the communities it serves. We look forward to collaborating with Ibrahima and his team of veterans in the mining industry, as Namib continues to grow and create shareholder value.”\n\n**Proposed Business Combination Overview** The Proposed Business Combination implies a pro forma combined enterprise value of PubCo $609 million, excluding additional earnout consideration, on a cash-free and debt-free basis, assuming no further redemptions of HCVI’s public shares and $60 million in targeted PIPE funding to be obtained prior to the Closing. The boards of directors of both HCVI and Namib have approved the proposed transaction, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to, among other things, the approvals by stockholders of HCVI and Namib and satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement.\n\nNet proceeds from the transaction are expected to enable Namib to invest further into its established How mine, while also contributing to the restart of production at two historically producing gold mines, Mazowe and Redwing, in Zimbabwe and expansion of operations into the DRC. Under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Namib’s existing shareholders will convert 100% of their equity ownership stakes into the combined company and are expected to own approximately 71% of the post-combination company upon consummation of the Proposed Business Combination.\n\nThe Proposed Business Combination has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both Namib and HCVI. \n\nAdditional information about the Proposed Business Combination, including a copy of the Business Combination Agreement, will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by HCVI with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and available at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bP7gjHgFZzFUtWRuuuqTGqp2qM9ckq7Hi7hmavdBRty-CsrX7ADsdgQA8r_Xfsh__8GcGkcXBmkvVvNXjHmp2Q==).\n\n**Advisors** Cohen & Company Capital Markets is serving as exclusive financial advisor and lead capital markets advisor to Namib, while Jett Capital Advisors LLC is serving as financial advisor to HCVI.
