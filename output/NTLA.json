(NASDAQ:NTLA), a leading clinical-stage gene editing company focused on revolutionizing medicine with CRISPR-based therapies, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z, also known as NTLA-2001) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN). Nex-z is an _in vivo_ CRISPR-based investigational therapy designed as a single-dose treatment to inactivate the  _TTR_ gene and thereby prevent the production of TTR protein for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. Development and commercialization of nex-z is led by Intellia as part of a multi-target collaboration with Regeneron.\n\n“This RMAT designation underscores the transformative potential of nex-z, our investigational _in vivo_ CRISPR-based gene editing therapy for those living with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy,” said Intellia President and Chief Executive Officer John Leonard, M.D. “It was granted following the FDA’s review of our compelling interim Phase 1 data that indicated our one-time treatment led to rapid, deep and durable TTR reduction, which is expected to halt and potentially reverse the disease. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to bring this potential paradigm-shifting therapy to patients as quickly as possible.”\n\nThe RMAT designation was established under the 21st Century Cures Act to expedite the development and review of promising therapeutic candidates, including genetic therapies, that are intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease. RMAT designation includes benefits, such as early interactions with the FDA, including discussions on surrogate or intermediate endpoints that could potentially support accelerated approval and satisfy post-approval requirements, and potential priority review of a product’s biologics license application (BLA).\n\nThis RMAT designation is the third special regulatory designation received by Intellia for nex-z. Nex-z was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. FDA and European Union Orphan Drug Designation by the European Commission.\n\n**About nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z, also known as NTLA-2001)** Based on Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR/Cas9 technology, nex-z has the potential to become the first one-time treatment for transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. Nex-z is designed to inactivate the  _TTR_ gene that encodes for the transthyretin (TTR) protein. Interim Phase 1 clinical data showed the administration of nex-z led to consistent, deep and long-lasting TTR reduction. Intellia leads development and commercialization of nex-z as part of a multi-target discovery, development and commercialization collaboration with Regeneron.\n\n**About Transthyretin (ATTR) Amyloidosis** Transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis, is a rare, progressive and fatal disease. Hereditary ATTR (ATTRv) amyloidosis occurs when a person is born with mutations in the TTR gene, which causes the liver to produce structurally abnormal transthyretin (TTR) protein with a propensity to misfold. These damaged proteins build up as amyloid in the body, causing serious complications in multiple tissues, including the heart, nerves and digestive system. ATTRv amyloidosis predominantly manifests as polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN), which can lead to nerve damage, or cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM), which can lead to heart failure. Some individuals without the genetic mutation produce non-mutated, or wild-type TTR proteins that become unstable over time, misfolding and aggregating in disease-causing amyloid deposits. This condition, called wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) amyloidosis, primarily affects the heart. There are an estimated 50,000 people worldwide living with ATTRv amyloidosis and between 200,000 and 500,000 people with ATTRwt amyloidosis. There is no known cure for ATTR amyloidosis and currently available medications are limited to slowing accumulation of misfolded TTR protein.\n\n**About Intellia Therapeutics**Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.

(NASDAQ:NTLA), a leading clinical-stage gene editing company focused on revolutionizing medicine with CRISPR-based therapies, today announced positive new clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial of nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z, also known as NTLA-2001) in patients with transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. Nex-z is an investigational _in vivo_ CRISPR-based gene editing therapy in development as a one-time treatment for ATTR amyloidosis. Development and commercialization of nex-z is led by Intellia as part of a multi-target collaboration with Regeneron.\n\nThe Phase 1 trial is an open-label, two-part study evaluating the safety and activity of nex-z in patients with either ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) or hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN). New results from the Phase 1 study were as of the data cut-off date of August 21, 2024. The data from the ATTR-CM arm of the Phase 1 study were presented in a late-breaking oral presentation at the 2024 American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in Chicago, Illinois, [and published online in the _ New England Journal of Medicine_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XCVG7IBRBLPSjOvijqvO5-aOe0Ol1DRl3m-r4KINdwL5j-qh5ASt_IJyJAQXe13HFzhD-sigtUg4GNc_xB76MjnOcw1W3sGRoHo1_-AVA3ObN2gaB1SSckNUnfHbX73qCRDzbU-EIi0DTwiNhIxb3ZcEkamoZiht5HzzrXOjsXtAjCS5teTJr40VtZH5U20It8nSYD_6FTnXBzSnmhH4rCRjIDqPiExY4F-5x2RCvPliDmva7F-9081NoZ3bMcDB) _._\n\n“The Phase 1 data presented today offer compelling evidence that deep and persistently low levels of TTR reduction achieved with nex-z, an investigational _in vivo_ CRISPR-based gene editing therapy, may favorably impact disease progression for people living with ATTR amyloidosis,” said Intellia President and Chief Executive Officer John Leonard, M.D. “The stability or improvement observed after a single dose of nex-z in multiple markers of cardiac disease progression is remarkable, especially considering the high proportion of patients with cardiomyopathy who had advanced heart failure. We observed similarly positive and consistent trends, indicative of a disease-modifying effect, in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. These results from the ongoing Phase 1 study increase our belief in the likelihood of success of our active Phase 3 studies based on our hypothesis that greater TTR reduction may lead to greater clinical benefit.”\n\n**ATTR-CM Arm Results**\n\n  * **Rapid, Deep and Durable Serum TTR Reduction:** Across all patients (n=36), a single dose of nex-z led to consistently rapid, deep and sustained serum TTR reduction, regardless of baseline levels, through the latest follow-up. At month 12, the mean serum TTR reduction was 90%, and the mean absolute residual serum TTR concentration was 17 µg/mL. With 11 patients who have reached 24 months of follow-up, all patients continued to show a sustained response with no evidence of a waning effect over time. The consistently low levels of serum TTR are anticipated to reduce the rate of ongoing amyloid formation and potentially allow for amyloid clearance and improvement in cardiac function.\n  * **Evidence of Disease Modification Across Multiple Markers of Cardiac Disease Progression:** In newly reported data of multiple markers of disease progression, patients treated with nex-z showed evidence of disease stabilization or improvement at month 12 compared to baseline. This evidence was observed despite the high proportion of patients enrolled with advanced or severe disease, as indicated by 50% classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III, 31% variant ATTR-CM, as well as elevated baseline N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and poor functional status. Evaluation of individual disease markers at 12 months showed stability or improvement in NT-proBNP, high sensitivity Troponin T (hs-Troponin T) and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in 81%, 94% and 77% of patients, respectively; 66% showed stability or improvement across all three markers examined. There also was evidence of benefit in quality of life, based on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Notably, 92% of patients were stable or improved in their NYHA functional classification. All patients with NYHA Class III at baseline (n=18) showed improvement or no change in their NYHA Class at month 12. The month 12 cardiac disease marker results are detailed in the table below.\n\n\n\nConsistent with the cardiac disease marker data, assessment of cardiac structure with either echocardiography or MRI, as well as measurements of cardiopulmonary exercise testing also showed a similar pattern of stability at month 12. The hospitalization rate for cardiovascular events among the 36 patients with ATTR-CM was 0.16/patient/year (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.36).\n\n**Biomarker of Cardiac Disease** | **Change from Baseline at Month 12**  \n---|---  \nNT-proBNP, geometric mean fold change (95% CI) (n=36) | 1.02 (0.88, 1.17)  \nhs-Troponin T, geometric mean fold change (95% CI) (n=36) | 0.95 (0.89, 1.01)  \n6MWT, median (Q1, Q3) (n=35) | +5 meters (-33, 49)  \nKCCQ, median (Q1, Q3) (n=36) | +8 points (-0.5 to 15)  \n  \n  * **Safety:** Nex-z was generally well tolerated across all patients. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were infusion-related reactions (IRRs), which were predominantly mild and moderate in severity, and did not result in any discontinuations.\n\n\n\n**ATTRv-PN Arm Results**\n\n  * **Rapid, Deep and Durable Serum TTR Reduction:** Across patients who received a dose of 0.3 mg/kg or higher (n=33), the mean serum TTR reduction was 91% and the mean absolute residual serum TTR concentration was 20 µg/mL at month 12. With 16 patients who have reached 24 months of follow-up, all patients continued to show a sustained response with no evidence of a waning effect over time. It is anticipated that greater TTR reduction may lead to a greater clinical benefit in patients with ATTRv-PN.\n  * **Evidence of Disease Modification on Clinical Measures:** Favorable trends indicating stability or improvement were observed in patients with ATTRv-PN based on evaluation of multiple clinical measures, including Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS), modified Neuropathy Impairment Score (mNIS+7) and modified BMI (mBMI). The clinical measure results are detailed in the table below.\n\n**Clinical Measures** | **Change from Baseline at Month 12** | **Change from Baseline at Month 24**  \n---|---|---  \n**Part 1: Dose-escalation portion (n=15)**  \nNIS, mean (SD) | -1.9* (5.42) | -4.5 (7.40)  \nmBMI, mean (SD) | 28.2 (93.07) | 54.7 (84.58)  \n**Part 2: Dose-expansion portion (n=21)**  \nmNIS+7, mean (SD) | -0.6† (11.07) | N/A  \nmBMI, mean (SD) | 2.4‡ (94.18) | N/A  \n  \n*n=14, †n=19, ‡n=20, N/A: Data for this time point is not yet available for the full cohort and will be reported in the future. \n\n  * **Safety:** Nex-z was generally well tolerated across all patients and at all dose levels tested. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were IRRs, which were mild or moderate, and did not result in any discontinuations.\n\n\n\n**Intellia Therapeutics Investor Webcast Information** Intellia will host a live webcast, today, November 16, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. CT / 12:00 p.m. ET to discuss the nex-z Phase 1 data.
