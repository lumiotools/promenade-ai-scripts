(NASDAQ: VS) (the “Company”) announced today the execution of two significant agreements with [Aspis Cyber Technologies, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=91qnFFhdN1Im0BsuZfh3HP9WW31d42BCxy_UnVk9wlGa9KrLzJ9AnSJai1yViA_rIkDEQEcdErnd_QGVRgc0DKH8BL4vc_LFIepJFzwxZAE= \"Opens in a new window\") (“ASPIS”), a cloud-based mobile endpoint cybersecurity technology firm.\n\nASPIS is affiliated with Cronus Equity Capital Group, LLC, which holds approximately 39.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. A significant shareholder of Cronus is also a shareholder of ASPIS, reinforcing the strategic alignment between the entities. In addition, a director of the Company is also a director of ASPIS and owns an equity interest in ASPIS.\n\nThe first agreement, a Business Funding Agreement (the “Funding Agreement”), provides for ASPIS to invest $2.5 million in Versus Systems. Under the Funding Agreement, ASPIS has initially invested $500,000, and on or before November 15, 2024, ASPIS will invest the balance of $2,000,000. In exchange for the investment, the Company has issued ASPIS an unsecured convertible promissory note with a principal balance of $2,500,000 (or such lesser amount if less is funded) (the “Note”).The Note is convertible into units with each unit comprised of one common share and one warrant to purchase one half of one common share at an exercise price of $4.00 per share. The Note may also be paid in cash at the option of ASPIS. The Note will not be convertible by the holder unless and until the Company obtains approval from its shareholders of the issuance of the equity under the Note and of the Company’s redomiciling to Delaware. The conversion price for the Note will be at least $1.16 but will be determined by the greater of (1) the 5-day volume-weighted average price, including the date prior to the initial funding, and (2) $1.16. The Company anticipates that it will hold its annual meeting to seek shareholder approval in December 2024. The Note is a senior note and will bear simple interest on the amounts funded at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum.\n\nThe second agreement, a Technology Licensing and Software Development Agreement (the “License Agreement”), enables ASPIS to license Versus Systems’ gamification, engagement, and QR code technology for integration into its cybersecurity offerings, particularly in sectors such as government, finance, gaming, and social media in exchange for a monthly license fee paid to the Company. ASPIS will also compensate the Company for any updates or innovations related to this technology.\n\nThese agreements form the foundation of the Company’s compliance plan, submitted to Nasdaq on October 7, 2024, to address the Company’s requirement to maintain a minimum of $2.5 million in shareholders’ equity for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as outlined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Through these agreements, Versus Systems aims to exceed the required minimum shareholders’ equity, ensuring compliance until at least September 30, 2025. The Company cannot provide any guarantee or assurances, however, that it will exceed or continue to meet the minimum shareholders’ equity requirement.\n\n“Partnering with ASPIS Cyber Technologies marks a pivotal moment for Versus Systems,” said Curtis Wolfe, Interim CEO of Versus Systems. “This collaboration not only strengthens our financial position but also enhances our technological capabilities, allowing us to provide cutting-edge solutions in cybersecurity.”\n\nUnder the terms of the agreements, assuming the Company receives shareholder approval of the issuance of equity under the Note and the Company’s redomiciling to Delaware, ASPIS could receive upon conversion of the Note and exercise of the warrants (assuming the final price is $1.16), 2,155,172 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 1,077,586 shares. Upon conversion of the Note, ASPIS would hold approximately 45.8% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. This percentage does not account for shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants or ASPIS’s option under the Note to convert any accrued and unpaid cash interest on the Note into units, which would result in additional shares issuable to ASPIS.\n\nThe License Agreement stipulates a monthly fee of $165,000 to be paid by ASPIS starting in January 2025, while also granting ASPIS a license to use any modifications made to the licensed technology for cybersecurity purposes.\n\nNasdaq will review the Company’s plan, and should the plan not be accepted, or if compliance is not achieved by February 18, 2025, Nasdaq may initiate delisting proceedings. In such cases, Versus Systems reserves the right to request a hearing for an additional extension.\n\n**About Versus Systems**\n\nVersus Systems, Inc. has developed a proprietary in-game prizing and promotions engine that allows game developers and publishers to offer real-world rewards inside their games.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nVersus Systems Inc. (the Company) was continued under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) effective January 2, 2007. The Company’s head office and\nregistered and records office is 1558 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, V6C 3J4, Canada. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol\n“VS”. The Company’s Unit A warrants are traded on NASDAQ under “VSSYW”. On November 9, 2022, the Company completed a one-for-15 reverse stock split of the\nCompany’s common shares. On December 28, 2023, the Company completed a one-for-16 reverse stock split of the Company’s common shares. All share and per share data\nare presented to reflect the reverse share splits on a retroactive basis.\nThe Company is engaged in the technology sector and has developed a proprietary prizing and promotions tool allowing game developers and creators of streaming media, live\nevents, broadcast TV, games, apps, and other content to offer real world prizes inside their content. The ability to win prizes drives increased levels of consumer engagement\ncreating an attractive platform for advertisers.\nIn June 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of multimedia, production, and interactive gaming company Xcite Interactive, a provider of online audience engagement\nthrough its owned and operated XEO technology platform. The Company partners with professional sports franchises across Major League Baseball (MLB), National Hockey\nLeague (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Football League (NFL) to drive audience engagement.\nIn September 2024 the Company closed down its operations within the United Kingdom, Versus Systems UK, Ltd. The United Kingdom had limited activity for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOn August 22, 2024, the Company received a letter from The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”), notifying the Company that it is no longer in compliance with the minimum\nstockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires listed companies to maintain stockholders’ equity\nof at least $2.5 million. In addition, as of August 22, 2024, the Company did not meet the alternative compliance standards relating to the market value of listed securities or net\nincome from continuing operations.\nIn October 2024, the Company entered into a $2,500,000 funding agreement with ASPIS Cyber Technologies (“ASPIS”). At that time, ASPIS delivered to the Company\n$500,000 and agreed to, on or before November 15, 2024, deliver to the Company an additional $2,000,000. However, the Company has informally agreed to defer the\n$2,000,000 until Nasdaq has progressed further with its review of the Company’s plan. Pursuant to that agreement, the Company issued to ASPIS a senior convertible\npromissory note in the principal amount of the total amount funded. The note provides that upon approval by the Company’s shareholders and the Company’s redomiciling to\nDelaware the amount funded to date plus, at ASPIS’s option, any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will be converted into units of the Company, each equal to (a) one\ncommon share of the Company and (b) a warrant to purchase one-half of one Common Share at a purchase price of $4.00 per one whole share, exercisable for five years.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, upon the Company’s shareholders’ approval and the Company’s redomiciling to Delaware, assuming only $2,500,000 is funded, ASPIS will\nreceive upon the Conversion 2,155,172 Common Shares and warrants to purchase an additional 1,077,586 shares.\n5\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nAdditionally, the Company entered into a Technology License and Software Development Agreement (the “License Agreement”) in October 2024 which provides for the\nCompany to license its gamification, engagement and QR code technology to ASPIS for use in ASPIS’s website business and for development of additional functionality for\nVersus’ technology.\nPursuant to the License Agreement, the Company granted ASPIS a license to use Versus’ technology in ASPIS’s website business that provides cybersecurity technology.\nASPIS will pay for any required technology modifications, improvements and developments to Versus’ technology in addition to a license fee of $165,000 per month beginning\nin January 2025. The Company will retain ownership of Versus’ technology and ASPIS will hold an exclusive license to use Versus’ technology in the cybersecurity industry so\nlong as ASPIS continues to pay the monthly license fee. The License Agreement has an initial term of one year with successive renewal terms of one year each upon ASPIS’s\nwritten approval, subject to earlier termination by the Company or ASPIS.\nIn October 2024, the Company warrant holders exercised 240,490 warrants issued in December 2023 offering upon such exercise, the Company issued 240,490 common shares\nat a price of $3.68 per share, for $885,003 proceeds.\nGoing Concern\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern, meaning it will continue\nin operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. Different bases of measurement may be\nappropriate if the Company is not expected to continue operations for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not achieved positive cash flow from\noperations and is not able to finance day to day activities through operations and as such, there is substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to attain profitable operations and generate funds therefrom and/or raise equity capital or\nborrowings sufficient to meet current and future obligations. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments as to the recoverability\nand classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These\nadjustments could be material.\nManagement’s plans include attempting to secure additional required funding through equity or debt financing, if available, seeking to enter into a partnership or other strategic\nagreement regarding, or sales or out-licensing of, its technology. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain required funding in the future. If the Company does\nnot obtain required funding, the Company’s cash resources will be depleted in the near term and the Company would be required to materially reduce or suspend operations,\nwhich would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom the Company have business\nrelationships. If the Company does not have sufficient funds to continue operations, the Company could be required to seek bankruptcy protection, dissolution or liquidation, or\nother alternatives that could result in the Company’s stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us. The Company has implemented expense reduction measures\nincluding, without limitation, employee headcount reductions and the reduction or discontinuation of certain product development programs. Additionally, the Company is not\nin compliance with certain listing standards of the Nasdaq National Market and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in curing the deficiencies and\nregaining compliance by the applicable cure dates. (See Note 11 for additional information).\n6\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for\ninterim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nAccordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, the\naccompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments and the elimination of\nintercompany accounts) considered necessary for a fair statement of all periods presented. The results of operations of the Company for any interim periods are not necessarily\nindicative of the results of operations for any other interim periods or for a full fiscal year. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read\nin conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023.\nBasis of consolidation\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Versus Systems Inc. and its subsidiaries, from the date control was acquired. Control exists\nwhen the Company possesses power over an investee, has exposure to variable returns from the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its\nreturns. All inter-company balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from inter-company transactions, are eliminated on consolidation.\nNon-controlling interest\nNon-controlling interest in the Company’s less than wholly owned subsidiaries are classified as a separate component of equity. On initial recognition, non-controlling interest\nis measured at the fair value of the non-controlling entity’s contribution into the related subsidiary. Subsequent to the original transaction date, adjustments are made to the\ncarrying amount of non-controlling interest for the non-controlling interest’s share of changes to the subsidiary’s equity.\nChanges in the Company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are recorded as equity transactions. The carrying amount of non-controlling\ninterest is adjusted to reflect the change in the non-controlling interest’s relative interest in the subsidiary, and the difference between the adjustment to the carrying amount of\nnon-controlling interests and the Company’s share of proceeds received and/or consideration paid is recognized directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.\n7\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nProportion of\nOwnership\nName of Subsidiary Place of Incorporation Interest Principal Activity\nVersus Systems (Holdco) Inc. United States of America 81.9% Holding Company\nVersus LLC United States of America 81.9% Technology Company\nXcite Interactive, Inc. United States of America 100.0% Technology Company\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are\nbased on historical experience and management’s assessment of current events and other facts and circumstances that are considered to be relevant. Actual results could differ\nfrom these estimates.\nSignificant assumptions about the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty that management has made at the end of the reporting period, that could result in a material\nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the event that actual results differ from assumptions made, relate to, but are not limited to, the following:\nBasic and diluted loss per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the\nreporting periods. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share, except that the weighted average shares outstanding are increased to\ninclude additional shares for the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding stock\noptions and warrants were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercises were used to acquire common stock at the average market price during the reporting periods.\nPotentially dilutive options and warrants excluded from diluted loss per share as of September 30, 2024 totaled 911,775 (September 30, 2023 – 127,041).\n8\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and any impairments. Depreciation is calculated based on the estimated residual value and estimated\neconomic life of the specific assets using the straight-line method over the period indicated below:\nAsset Rate\nComputers Straight line, 3 years\nRight of use assets Shorter of useful life or lease term\nFair Value Measurements and Financial instruments\nThe Company applies Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires disclosures to be provided for fair value measurements. ASC\n820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n- Level 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n- Level 2-Includes other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\n- Level 3-Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nASC 820 recommends three main approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach, and the cost approach. The\nCompany uses the appropriate approach based on the nature of the asset or liability being measured. Financial instruments include cash, receivables, restricted deposit, accounts\npayable and accrued liabilities. The carrying values of the financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short-term\nmaturities.\nDeferred financing costs\nDeferred financing costs consist primarily of direct incremental costs related to the Company’s public offering of its common stock. Upon completion of the Company’s\nfinancings any deferred costs were offset against the proceeds in the condensed consolidated statement changes in shareholders’ equity.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the assets and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences\nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, using\nenacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse.\n9\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets in these cases then management does not believe that the realization is more likely than not. While management\nbelieves that its judgements and estimates regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual results may materially affect the\nCompany’s future financial results.\nThe Company recognizes any uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by relevant taxing authority. An\nuncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties\nrelated to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record any accruals for interest and penalties. The\nCompany does not foresee material changes to its uncertain tax positions within its next twelve months. The Company’s tax years are subject to examination for 2020 and\nforward for U.S. Federal tax purposes and for 2019 and forward for state tax purposes.\nLeases\nThe Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time\nin exchange for consideration. The lease term corresponds to the non-cancellable period of each contract.\nAll leases are accounted for as operating leases wherein rental payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the periods of their respective leases. Operating leases (with\nan initial term of more than 12 months) are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, operating lease liabilities (current), and operating lease liabilities (non-\ncurrent) in the condensed interim consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on\nthe present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company utilizes a market-based approach to estimate the incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease prepayments, reduced by lease\nincentives and accrued rent. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nLoss contingencies\nA loss contingency is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that\nan outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Loss contingencies are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that\nreflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.\n10\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nValuation of Equity Units Issued in Private Placements\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, particularly ASC 505-10 and ASC 815, the Company has adopted the fair value method for the valuation of equity units issued in private\nplacements, which typically comprise common shares and warrants. For each private placement, the Company separately estimates the fair value of both the common shares\nand the warrants at the date of issuance. The determination of fair value is based on market conditions, volatility, and other relevant factors at the time of issuance.\n1. Common Shares: The fair value of the common shares issued is measured based on observable market prices, if available, or estimated using appropriate\nvaluation techniques considering the terms of the shares and market conditions.\n2. Warrants: Warrants are valued using an appropriate option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes or a binomial model. The model incorporates various\ninputs, including the share price, expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and any dividends.\nThe total proceeds from the issuance of equity units are allocated between the common shares and the warrants based on their relative fair values at the date of issuance. This\nallocation is reflected in the equity section of the condensed interim consolidated balance sheet, with the fair value of the warrants recorded as a component of additional paid-\nin capital in the equity section. If the warrants expire unexercised, the amount remains in additional paid-in capital.\nThis method of valuation and allocation ensures compliance with the fair value measurement and equity classification requirements of U.S. GAAP.\nShare-based compensation\nThe Company grants stock options to acquire common shares of the Company to directors, officers, employees and consultants. An individual is classified as an employee\nwhen the individual is an employee for legal or tax purposes, or provides services similar to those performed by an employee.\nThe fair value of stock options is measured on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is recognized over the vesting period. Consideration paid for\nthe shares on the exercise of stock options is credited to capital stock.\nIn situations where equity instruments are issued to non-employees and some or all of the goods or services received by the Company as consideration cannot be specifically\nidentified, they are measured at fair value of the share-based payment. Otherwise, share-based payments are measured at the fair value of goods or services received.\n11\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue recognition\nIn general, the Company recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Company,\nwhere there is evidence of an arrangement, when the selling price is fixed or determinable, and when specific criteria have been met or there are no significant remaining\nperformance obligations for each of the Company’s activities as described below. Foreseeable losses, if any, are recognized in the year or period in which the loss is determined.\nThe Company earns revenue in two primary ways: 1) the sales of software-as-a-service (SAAS) from its interactive production software platform or 2) development and\nmaintenance of custom-built software or other professional services.\nThe Company recognizes SAAS revenues from its interactive production sales over the life of the contract as its performance obligations are satisfied. Payment terms vary by\ncontract and can be periodic or one-time payments.\nThe Company recognizes revenues received from the development and maintenance of custom-built software and other professional services provided upon the satisfaction of\nits performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. Performance obligations can\nbe satisfied either at a single point in time or over time. For those performance obligations that are satisfied at a single point in time, the revenue is recognized at that time. For\neach performance obligation satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation.\nFor revenues received from the sales of advertising, the Company is deemed the agent in its revenue agreements. The Company does not own or obtain control of the digital\nadvertising inventory. The Company recognizes revenues upon the achievement of agreed-upon performance criteria for the advertising inventory, such as a number of views,\nor clicks. As the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction, the Company recognizes revenue from sales of advertising on a net basis, which excludes amounts payable to\npartners under the Company’s revenue sharing agreements.\nThe Company’s contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual\nperformance obligations separately if they are capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. Determining whether products and services are\nconsidered distinct performance obligations may require significant judgment. Judgment is also required to determine the stand-alone selling price, for each distinct\nperformance obligation.\n12\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nDeferred revenue\nRevenue recognition of sales is recorded on a monthly basis upon delivery or as the services are provided. Cash received in advance for services are recorded as deferred\nrevenue based on the proportion of time remaining under the service arrangement as of the reporting date.\nForeign exchange\nThe functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates and has been determined for each entity within the Company.\nThe functional currency for the Company and its subsidiaries is the United States dollar. The functional currency determinations were conducted through an analysis of the\nconsideration factors identified in ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters.\nForeign currency transactions in currencies other than the United States dollar are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency\ntransaction gains and losses are generally recognized in profit or loss and presented within gain (loss) on foreign exchange.\nAt the end of each reporting period, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate\nof exchange at the date of the condensed interim consolidated balance sheets. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at\nhistorical rates. Revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates approximating those in effect on the date of the\ntransactions. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity on the condensed interim consolidated\nstatements of stockholders’ equity.\nComprehensive income (loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) and represents the change in shareholders’ equity (deficit) which results\nfrom transactions and events from sources other than the Company’s shareholders. Comprehensive loss differs from net loss for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, due to the effects of foreign translation gains and losses.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nNew accounting pronouncements\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, Business Combinations—Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.

This ASU clarifies leasing transactions among entities under common\ncontrol, emphasizing the use of written terms for lease existence and classification. It is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the amendments in this update during the current year and the adoption did not have a material\nimpact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the\nProportional Amortization Method.

It allows entities to apply this\nmethod to a broader range of investments that generate tax credits, providing greater flexibility in accounting for these investments. ASU 2023-02 is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the amendments in this update during the current year and the\nadoption did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-03, which amends various SEC paragraphs in the Accounting Standards Codification. This includes amendments to Presentation of\nFinancial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505),\nand Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The amendments are in response to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120 and other SEC staff announcements and\nguidance. This ASU does not introduce new guidance and therefore does not have a specified transition or effective date. However, for smaller reporting companies, the ASU is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted the amendments in this update during the current year and the adoption did not have a\nmaterial impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification\nInitiative. This ASU introduces changes to the disclosure requirements, aligning them more closely with the SEC’s initiatives for simplification and update. It specifically\naddresses various amendments in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification in response to the SEC’s drive for clearer and more streamlined disclosures. This ASU is\neffective for public business entities classified as smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted the amendments in\nthis update during the current year and the adoption did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nManagement does not believe any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncement, if adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s present or\nfuture consolidated financial statements.\n14\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n3.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its payment obligations. The Company has no material\ncounterparties to its financial instruments with the exception of the financial institutions which hold its cash. The Company manages its credit risk by ensuring that its cash is\nplaced with a major financial institution with strong investment grade ratings by a primary ratings agency. The Company’s receivables consist of goods and services due from\ncustomers and tax due from the Canadian government.\n10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings and other matters arising in connection with the conduct of its business activities. Many of these proceedings\nmay be at the preliminary stages and/or seek an indeterminate amount of damages. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and\nlawsuits are not significant and we do not currently expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\n11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nASPIS Agreements\nOn October 7, 2024, the Company entered into two agreements with ASPIS.ASPIS, an affiliate of the Company’s largest shareholder—Cronus Equity Capital Group, LLC\n(“CECG”)—is a cloud-based mobile endpoint cyber security technology company for anti-tapping and anti-hacking within the government, finance, gaming and social media\nsectors. CEGC holds approximately 39.5% of the outstanding common shares of the Company.\nThe first agreement was a $2,500,000 funding agreement with ASPIS. At that time, ASPIS delivered to the Company $500,000 and agreed to, on or before November 15, 2024,\ndeliver to the Company an additional $2,000,000. However, the Company has informally agreed to defer the $2,000,000 until Nasdaq has progressed further with its review of\nthe Company’s plan. Pursuant to that agreement, the Company issued to ASPIS a senior convertible promissory note in the principal amount of the total amount funded. The\nnote provides that upon approval by the Company’s shareholders and the Company’s redomiciling to Delaware the amount funded to date plus, at ASPIS’s option, any accrued\nand unpaid interest thereon, will be converted into units of the Company, each equal to (a) one common share of the Company and (b) a warrant to purchase one-half of one\nCommon Share at a purchase price of $4.00 per one whole share, exercisable for five years.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, upon the Company’s shareholders’ approval and the Company’s redomiciling to Delaware, assuming only $2,500,000 is funded, ASPIS will\nreceive upon the Conversion 2,155,172 Common Shares and warrants to purchase an additional 1,077,586 shares.\nAdditionally, the Company entered into a Technology License and Software Development Agreement (the “License Agreement”) in October 2024 which provides for the\nCompany to license its gamification, engagement and QR code technology to ASPIS for use in ASPIS’s website business and for development of additional functionality for\nVersus’ technology.\nPursuant to the License Agreement, the Company granted ASPIS a license to use Versus’ technology in ASPIS’s website business that provides cybersecurity technology.\nASPIS will pay for any required technology modifications, improvements and developments to Versus’ technology in addition to a license fee of $165,000 per month beginning\nin January 2025. The Company will retain ownership of Versus’ technology and ASPIS will hold an exclusive license to use Versus’ technology in the cybersecurity industry so\nlong as ASPIS continues to pay the monthly license fee. The License Agreement has an initial term of one year with successive renewal terms of one year each upon ASPIS’s\nwritten approval, subject to earlier termination by the Company or ASPIS.\nIn October 2024, the Company warrant holders exercised 240,490 warrants issued in December 2023 offering upon such exercise, the Company issued 240,490 common shares\nat a price of $3.68 per share, for $885,003 proceeds.\n20\nItem 2.

Our products include\nour in-venue XEO and Filter Fan Cam products for live events, and our new stand-alone “Winfinite” product that can be used by brands, advertising agencies, and content\npartners to reach potential customers outside of sports venues, on mobile devices. We also have an IP portfolio that could create future licensing and product development\nopportunities including our recently allowed Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning (“ML”) series of patent claims.\nWith the acquisition of Xcite Interactive in June 2021, we acquired a number of key pieces of technology and relationships that have helped to drive our engagement and\nrewards business, including a live events fan engagement business that has partnered with professional sports franchises in the National Football League (“NFL”), the National\nBasketball Association (“NBA”), the National Hockey League (“NHL”) and others to increase audience engagement using interactive gaming functions like trivia, polling, and\ncasual games that can be played alongside live experiences whether a player is at-home, in a restaurant, or in-venue at the event itself. Our three largest customers in 2023 were\nthe San Jose Sharks, the Sacramento Kings, and ENT Marketing, a marketing agency that used our platform to promote Coca-Cola products.\nWe now have three principal software products. Our eXtreme Engagement Online or “XEO” platform is designed primarily for in-venue main-board work in stadiums and\narenas. Our Filter Fan Cam (FFC) platform is an Augmented Reality filtering tool that can be used for mobile and in-venue applications. In addition, we have a stand-alone\ngaming and prizing product that we call “Winfinite,” which allows brands, media companies, and advertising agencies to reach out to customers directly on their mobile\ndevices. We license these three software products to teams, ad agencies, and other content creators.\n21\nSignificant Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue. In general, we recognize revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to us, where there\nis evidence of an arrangement, when the selling price is fixed or determinable, and when specific criteria have been met or there are no significant remaining performance\nobligations for each of our activities as described below. Foreseeable losses, if any, are recognized in the year or period in which the loss is determined.\nWe earn revenue through the development and maintenance of custom-built software.\nWe recognize revenues received from the development and maintenance of custom-built software and other professional services provided upon the satisfaction of our\nperformance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. Performance obligations can be satisfied\neither at a single point in time or over time. For those performance obligations that are satisfied at a single point in time, the revenue is recognized at that time. For each\nperformance obligation satisfied over time, we recognize revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation.\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are\ncapable of being distinct within the context of the contract. Determining which performance obligations are considered distinct may require significant judgment. Judgment is\nalso required to determine the amount of revenue associated with each distinct performance obligation.\nOperating Expenses. We classify our operating expense as research and development, and selling, general and administrative. Personnel costs are the primary component\nof each of these operating expense categories, which consist of cash-based personnel costs, such as salaries, benefits and bonuses. Additionally, these categories include\nintangible amortization, amortization expense, interest expense, software costs, professional fees and share-based compensation.\nOperating Results\nComparison of Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Three\nMonths Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nStatement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss Data:\nRevenue $ 3,848 $ 22,950\nCost of revenues - 23,570\nGross Margin 3,848 (620)\nExpenses\nResearch and development 11,462 272,111\nSelling, general and administrative 521,410 1,617,161\nTotal Operating Expenses 532,872 1,889,272\nOperating loss (529,024) (1,889,892)\nOther income (expense) 73 354,105\nNet loss (528,951) (1,535,787)\nOther total comprehensive loss:\nChange in foreign currency translation, net of tax (52,823) (4,814)\nTotal comprehensive loss $ (581,774) (1,540,601)\nBasic and diluted loss per share to shareholders $ (0.22) $ (1.99)\n22\nRevenue\nOur revenues are derived primarily from software licensing. Revenue was $3,848 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of\n$19,102, or 83%, from $22,950 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the number of clients from\nSeptember 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues was none for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $23,570, or 100%, from $23,570 for the three month period\nended September 30, 2023. The decrease was in line with the decrease in revenue\nResearch and development\nResearch and development was $11,462 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $260,649, or 96%, from $272,111 for the three\nmonth period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to significant reductions in staff related to our company restructuring.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative was $521,410 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $1,095,751, or 68%, from $1,617,161\nfor the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payroll as the Company reduced head count and a decrease in\nprofessional fees.\nLoss from Operations\nLoss from operations was $529,024 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $1,360,868, or 72%, from $1,889,892 for the three\nmonth period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of decreased spend on professional fees and payroll.\nOperating Results\nComparison of Results of Operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Nine months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nStatement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss Data:\nRevenue $ 57,288 $ 236,953\nCost of revenues 40,277 79,497\nGross Margin 17,011 157,456\nExpenses\nResearch and development 118,077 1,056,918\nSelling, general and administrative 3,429,062 4,473,710\nTotal Operating Expenses 3,547,139 5,530,628\nOperating loss (3,530,128) (5,373,172)\nOther income/(expense) (248) 354,105\nNet loss (3,530,376) (5,019,067)\nOther total comprehensive income (loss):\nChange in foreign currency translation, net of tax 28,660 23,383\nTotal comprehensive loss $ (3,501,716) (4,995,684)\nBasic and diluted loss per share to shareholders $ (1.29) $ (7.06)\n23\nRevenue\nOur revenues are derived primarily from software licensing. Revenue was $57,288 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of\n$179,665, or 76%, from $236,953 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the number of clients from\nSeptember 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues was $40,277 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $39,220, or 49%, from $79,497 for the nine month period\nended September 30, 2023. The decrease was in line with the decrease in revenue.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development was $118,077 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $938,841, or 89%, from $1,056,918 for the nine\nmonth period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels, including a large portion of our engineering staff, and a reduction in\nsoftware costs.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative was $3,429,062 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $1,044,648, or 23%, from $4,473,710\nfor the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payroll as the Company reduced head count and a decrease in\nprofessional fees.\nLoss from Operations\nLoss from operations was $3,530,128 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $1,843,044, or 34%, from $5,373,172 for the nine\nmonth period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of decreased spend on professional fees and payroll.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had cash of $471,248 and a working capital surplus of $1,215,990 as at September 30, 2024, compared to a cash position of $4,689,007 and working capital surplus of\n$4,546,227 as at December 31, 2023. The decrease in our cash position and decrease in working capital surplus was related to using cash to fund operations and ongoing losses.\nOur financial condition and liquidity is and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including:\n● our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;\n● future indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness;\n● the availability of public and private debt and equity financing;\n● changes in exchange rates which will impact our generation of cash flows from operations when measured in CAD; and\n● our capital expenditure requirements.\n24\nOverview\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of approximately $10.5 million\nand $22.4 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the company incurred a net loss of $3.5 million. During such periods, we have financed our\noperations primarily through an initial public offering of our common shares in January 2021 and subsequent public offerings, registered direct offerings, and private\nplacements. In February 2023, we completed a registered direct offering of our common shares in which we received gross proceeds of $2.25 million and net proceeds of\napproximately $2 million. In October 2023, we completed a public direct offering of our common shares in which we received gross proceeds of approximately $3 million and\nnet proceeds of approximately $2.5 million. In November 2023, we completed a private placement of our equity securities in which we received gross proceeds of $2.6 million.\nThroughout 2023, we received approximately $4.6 million in proceeds from warrant exercises. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 was $4.7 million. Our\nprimary cash needs are for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to fund our operations.\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a new business. We believe that our current resources and the expected revenues from operations will be\ninsufficient to fund our planned operations for the next twelve months. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 stated that our recurring losses from operations, accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2023, inability to achieve positive cash flows\nfrom operations and inability to fund day to day activities through operations indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nWhile we plan to increase our cash flow from our operations to address some of our liquidity concerns, to date we have been unable to do so and are experiencing declining\nrevenues. Accordingly, we are evaluating other strategic alternatives. However, to execute our business plan and implement our business strategy, we anticipate that we will\nneed to obtain additional financing and may choose to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings, a bank line of credit, borrowings from affiliates\nor other arrangements. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Furthermore, any additional capital raised\nthrough the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute our current shareholders’ ownership in us and could also result in a decrease in the market price of our common\nshares. The terms of those securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include the issuance of warrants or other\nderivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. Furthermore, any debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest\ncosts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, when needed, to continue operations in their current form. If we cannot raise needed funds, we\nmight be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses, including reductions in our research and development expenses or headcount reductions, which could\nadversely affect our ability to implement our business plan and ultimately our viability as a company, or we may be forced to liquidate the company.\nCash Flows\nThe following summarizes the key components of our cash flows for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine months Nine months\nPeriod Ended Period Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (4,255,345) $ (4,355,723)\nNet cash used in investing activities - (14,106)\nNet cash provided by financing activities - 5,362,978\nEffect of exchange rates 37,586 (3,198)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash $ (4,217,759) $ 989,951\n25\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was $4,255,345 as compared to $4,355,723 for the nine month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the change in our net loss of $1,436,364 offset by increase in non-cash stock\ncompensation offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was none as compared to $14,106 for the nine month period ended September 30,\n2023. The change in cash flow used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a significant reduction in payroll capitalized for the development of intangible assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was none for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $5,362,978 for the nine month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The change in cash flow provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to proceeds we received from the issuance of common shares, net of\nissuance costs, exercise of warrants and options, which was offset by repayments on notes payable and lease liabilities in 2023.\nIndebtedness\nNotes Payable\nFrom 2017 to December 31, 2022, we issued $4,750,818 aggregate principal amount of promissory notes primarily to Brian Tingle, one of our directors. The notes bore\ninterest at the prime rate of the Bank of Canada, which has ranged from 2.45% to 3.95% per annum, compounded annually, that was payable quarterly, and had a maturity date\nof three years from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2023, all loans have been repaid and we had recorded $0 in accrued interest that was included in accounts payable\nand accrued liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and\nmanagement’s assessment of current events and other facts and circumstances that are considered to be relevant. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nSignificant assumptions about the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty that management has made at the end of the reporting year, that could result in a\nmaterial adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the event that actual results differ from assumptions made, relate to, but are not limited to, the following:\nEstimate for excess credit losses\nWe apply the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model under ASC 326 for impairment of financial assets. This model requires the recognition of an allowance for\ncredit losses based on expected losses over the life of the asset. If the credit risk of a financial asset decreases in a subsequent period, any previously recognized impairment\nloss is reversed through profit or loss, limited to the extent that the carrying amount does not exceed what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment not been\nrecognized.\nDeferred financing costs\nDeferred financing costs consist primarily of direct incremental costs related to our public offerings of our common stock completed in February 2023. Upon completion of\nour public offering and financing any deferred costs were offset against the proceeds.\n26\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the\nproperty and equipment. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The initial cost of property\nand equipment comprises its purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use. The purchase price\nor construction cost is the aggregate amount of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Where an item of property and\nequipment is comprised of significant components with different useful lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property and equipment. For all property\nand equipment, depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset less its residual value. Depreciation is calculated starting on the date that\nproperty and equipment is available for its intended use.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired separately were measured upon initial recognition at cost, which comprises the purchase price plus any costs directly attributable to the\npreparation of the asset for its intended use. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations (Xcite Interactive) or asset acquisitions were initially recognized at fair\nvalue as at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, intangible assets were carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment charges.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes utilizing the assets and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the\nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, using enacted tax rates\nand laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse.\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets (DTA’s) when management does not believe that the realization of DTA’s is more likely than not. While\nmanagement believes that its judgements and estimates regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual results may materially affect\nour future financial results.\nWe recognize any uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by relevant taxing authority. An uncertain\nincome tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Our policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax\nmatters in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not record any accruals for interest and penalties. We do not foresee material changes to our\nuncertain tax positions within the next twelve months.\nDetermination of share-based payments\nThe estimation of share-based payments (including warrants and stock options) requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs\nnecessary for the valuation model chosen. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model at the date of the grant. We make estimates as to the volatility, the expected life, dividend\nyield and the time of exercise, as applicable. The expected volatility is based on the average volatility of share prices of similar companies over the period of the expected life\nof the applicable warrants and stock options. The expected life is based on historical data. These estimates may not necessarily be indicative of future actual patterns.\nDeferred revenues and revenue recognition\nRevenue recognition of sales is recorded on a monthly basis upon delivery or as the services are provided. Cash received in advance for services are recorded as deferred\nrevenue based on the proportion of time remaining under the service arrangement as of the reporting date.\n27\nFunctional currency\nThe functional currency for each of our subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective entity operates. Such determination\ninvolves certain judgements to identify the primary economic environment. We reconsider the functional currency of our subsidiaries if there is a change in events and/or\nconditions which determine the primary economic environment.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot required under Regulation S-K for smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act.\nBased upon that evaluation, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that the information required to be disclosed by us in the\nreports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, as appropriate, to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the fiscal quarter\ncovered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n28\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nNone\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOther than as set for below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (our “Annual Report”). Our business involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the\nrisks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes as disclosed in our Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report are not the only ones we face, and\nadditional risk and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. The realization of any\nof these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects as well as\nour ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. In that event, the market price of our common shares could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nIf we do not successfully raise additional capital, improve our operating cash flow, or complete a strategic transaction, our board of directors may decide to pursue a\ndissolution and liquidation of our Company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such\nliquidation as well as the amount of cash that must be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities, as to which we can give you no assurance.\nThere can be no assurance that we will successfully raise additional capital, that we will improve our operating cash flow, or that we will be able to complete a strategic\ntransaction. If none of those occur, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our Company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for\ndistribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, ultimately, such liquidation, since the amount of cash available for distribution\ncontinues to decrease as we fund our operations while pursuing a financing, improved operations, or a strategic transaction. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not\nachieved positive cash flow from operations and is not able to finance day to day activities through operations and as such, there is substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability\nto continue as a going concern.\nIn addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of our Company. If a dissolution and liquidation were to be pursued, our\nboard of directors, in consultation with our advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders\nof our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our Company. A liquidation would be a\nlengthy and uncertain process with no assurance of any value ever being returned to our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to regain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it difficult for you to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the\nmarket value of publicly held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholders' equity, among others, and requirements relating to\nboard and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn September 16, 2024, we received a notice, or Notice, from the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, that we are not currently in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid\nprice requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), or the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The Notice\nindicated that, consistent with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 days, or until March 16, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement\nby having the bid price of our common stock meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days. The Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of our\ncommon stock, and our common stock continues to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “VS” at this time.\n29\nIn the event we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by March 16, 2025, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance\nperiod if, on the last day of the initial compliance period, we meet the market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing as well as all other standards for\ninitial listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and provide Nasdaq written notice of our\nintention to cure the bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. If we do not indicate our intent to cure the deficiency, or if it appears to Nasdaq that it is not\npossible for us to cure the deficiency, we will not be eligible for the second compliance period and our common stock will become subject to delisting. In the event that we\nreceive notice that our common stock is being delisted, the Nasdaq listing rules permit us to appeal a delisting determination by the staff to a hearings panel.\nWe intend to actively monitor the bid price of our common stock and will consider available options to regain compliance with the listing requirements, including such\nactions as effecting a reverse stock split, for which our board of directors has received stockholder approval. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to regain\ncompliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and even if we do, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing\nrequirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market or that our common stock will not be delisted in the future. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable listing\nrequirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders’ equity or market values of our common stock in which case, our common\nstock could be delisted notwithstanding our ability to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nDelisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market may adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may\nsignificantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other\nnegative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities.\nIf we are delisted from Nasdaq and we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the\n“pink sheets.” As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others:\n● a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n● a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result\nin a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n● a limited amount of news and little or no analyst coverage for us;\n● an inability to qualify for exemptions from state securities registration requirements, which may require us to comply with applicable state securities laws; and\n● a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to registration statements on Form S-3) or obtain additional financing in the future.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3. Default Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nNone.\n30\nItem 6.

FORM 10-K SUMMARY 52\nSIGNATURES 53\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-1\ni\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward- Looking Statements\nWhen used in this annual report, statements that are not historical in nature, including those containing words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,”\n“continue,” “intend,” “should,” “may” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and\nwhich do not relate solely to historical matters, are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”)). In particular, statements pertaining to our trends, liquidity and capital resources, among others, contain forward-looking statements. You can also identify\nforward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the\nfollowing:\n● our prospects, including our future business, revenues, expenses, net income, earnings per share, gross margins, profitability, cash flows, cash position, liquidity,\nfinancial condition and results of operations, backlog of orders and revenue, our targeted growth rate, our goals for future revenues and earnings, and our expectations\nabout realizing the revenues in our backlog and in our sales pipeline;\n● the effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations of current and future economic, business, market and regulatory conditions, including the\ncurrent economic and market conditions and their effects on our customers and their capital spending and ability to finance purchases of our products, services,\ntechnologies and systems;\n● the effects of fluctuations in sales on our business, revenues, expenses, net income, earnings per share, margins, profitability, cash flows, capital expenditures, liquidity,\nfinancial condition and results of operations;\n● our products, services, technologies and systems, including their quality and performance in absolute terms and as compared to competitive alternatives, their benefits\nto our customers and their ability to meet our customers’ requirements, and our ability to successfully develop and market new products, services, technologies and\nsystems;\nii\n● our markets, including our market position and our market share;\n● our ability to successfully develop, operate, grow and diversify our operations and businesses;\n● our business plans, strategies, goals and objectives, and our ability to successfully achieve them;\n● the sufficiency of our capital resources, including our cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, availability of borrowings under our credit and\nfinancing arrangements and other capital resources, to meet our future working capital, capital expenditure, lease and debt service and business growth needs;\n● the value of our assets and businesses, including the revenues, profits and cash flows they are capable of delivering in the future;\n● the effects on our business operations, financial results, and prospects of business acquisitions, combinations, sales, alliances, ventures and other similar business\ntransactions and relationships;\n● our ability to remain in compliance with Nasdaq listing standards;\n● industry trends and customer preferences and the demand for our products, services, technologies and systems; and\n● the nature and intensity of our competition, and our ability to successfully compete in our markets.\nThese statements are necessarily subjective, are based upon our current plans, intentions, objectives, goals, strategies, beliefs, projections and expectations, and involve\nknown and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially\nfrom any future results, performance or achievements described in or implied by such statements. Actual results may differ materially from expected results described in our\nforward-looking statements, including with respect to correct measurement and identification of factors affecting our business or the extent of their likely impact, the accuracy\nand completeness of the publicly-available information with respect to the factors upon which our business strategy is based, or the success of our business. Furthermore,\nindustry forecasts are likely to be inaccurate, especially over long periods of time.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether, or the times by\nwhich, our performance or results may be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and management’s\nbelief as of that time with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those\nexpressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause actual results, our performance or achievements, or industry results to differ\nmaterially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in this annual report, as\nwell as other risks and factors identified from time to time in our SEC filings.\niii\nPART I\nITEM 1. Business\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to reinvent the way our customers interact with consumers through live events, games, apps and streaming content.\nOur Company\nWe offer a suite of proprietary business-to-business software tools that are meant to drive user engagement through gamification and rewards. These tools allow our\npartners to offer in-game prizing and rewards, including merchandise, coupons, digital goods, and sweepstakes entries — inside their websites, their venues, or their streaming\nmedia content.\nOur customers are mostly sports teams, venues, and advertising agencies, which typically use our products as part of their live events or as part of an advertising campaign\nwith the goal of engaging fans, increasing consented first-party data, and increasing sales.\nOur products and games are designed so that end users of our products can earn prizes by registering on our system and completing in-content challenges like trivia, polls,\nor casual mobile games. Players can use our system to play a variety of games and earn a wide range of prize types, provided by advertisers and sponsors. Our products, include\nour in-venue XEO and Filter Fan Cam products for live events, and our new stand-alone “Winfinite” product that can be used by brands, advertising agencies, and content\npartners to reach potential customers outside of sports venues, on mobile devices. We also have an IP portfolio that can create future licensing and product development\nopportunities including our recently allowed Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning (“ML”) series of patent claims.\nWith the acquisition of Xcite Interactive in June 2021, we acquired a number of key pieces of technology and relationships that have helped to drive our engagement and\nrewards business, including a live events fan engagement business that has partnered with professional sports franchises in the National Football League (“NFL”), the National\nBasketball Association (“NBA”), the National Hockey League (“NHL”) and others to increase audience engagement using interactive gaming functions like trivia, polling, and\ncasual games that can be played alongside live experiences whether a player is at-home, in a restaurant, or in-venue at the event itself. Our three largest customers in 2023 were\nthe San Jose Sharks, the Sacramento Kings, and ENT Marketing, a marketing agency that used our platform to promote Coca-Cola products.\nWe now have three principal software products. Our eXtreme Engagement Online or “XEO” platform is designed primarily for in-venue main-board work in stadiums and\narenas. Our Filter Fan Cam (“FFC”) platform is an Augmented Reality filtering tool that can be used for mobile and in-venue applications. In addition, we have a stand-alone\ngaming and prizing product that we call “Winfinite,” which allows brands, media companies, and advertising agencies to reach out to customers directly on their mobile\ndevices. We license these three software products to teams, ad agencies, and other content creators.\nOur Products and Services\nWe provide the following products and services to our partners and customers:\n● Analytics and support for in-venue products XEO and FFC. Our in-venue fan engagement products are used at a variety of live-event and other entertainment\nfocused properties like stadiums and arenas, but they can also be used at conferences, theme parks, and restaurants to increase audience and customer engagement.\nContent partners, including professional sports teams, can use XEO and FFC in conjunction with their existing video screens, “jumbotrons”, “halo boards”, “main\nboards”, as well as branded apps to reach potential customers with games and interactive experiences that enhance the live event.\n● Support and Analytics for Winfinite. Winfinite is an interactive advertising tool that increases awareness, affinity, data, and incremental sales. It allows content\ncreators, marketers, agencies, and other advertisers to increase customer acquisition and loyalty through a combination of games and rewards. The product is\ncompatible with a number of digital platforms and can be integrated into customers’ existing advertising campaigns.\n1\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development team, including in-house and as-needed contract resources, consists of technical engineering, product management, and user experience, and\nis responsible for the design, architecture, creation, and quality of our platform. We have invested substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platform\nfeatures and functionalities and expand the services we offer. We believe the timely development of new, and the enhancement of our existing, services and platform features\nwould enhance our competitive position. We utilize an agile development process to deliver software releases, fixes and updates.\nCompetition\nInteractive media, live-events, in-venue advertising, and rewarded advertising are all highly competitive businesses, characterized by increasing product introductions and\nrapidly-emerging new platforms and technologies. With respect to competing for customers for our platform, we will compete primarily on the basis of functionality, quality,\nbrand and customer reviews. We will compete for platform placement based on these factors, as well as our relationship with the content owner, historical performance,\nperception of sales potential and relationships with owners and licensors of brands, properties and other content.\nWe believe that our small size will provide us some amount of a competitive edge in the near term as we are able to make quick decisions to take advantage of customer\npreferences and emerging technologies like AI.\nWith respect to our prizing and rewards platform, we compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including industry leaders such as TapJoy, Honey,\nRakuten, and Otello who make their money largely on the free-to-play or free-to-use distribution of coupons and rewards. Beyond these direct competitors, we face a certain\namount of competition from pay-to-play “rewards” companies like Skillz, FanDuel, or DraftKings that also use games and monetary rewards to drive user growth – although in\ntheir case, they derive the majority of their revenues directly from users rather than brands and sponsors.\nWe also face increased competition from large media and technology companies with significant online presences, such as Apple, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Meta,\nMicrosoft, Netflix Shopify, or Yahoo, as those companies move to expand their interactive offerings. This competition could increase if these larger industry players begin to\nadd prizing or rewards into their offerings.\nWe are also aware of the increasing role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the personalized content space, including personalized advertising. We have been researching the\nspace for a number of years and have been filing patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to protect our uses of AI and Machine Learning (ML) in\ntrying to optimize both the player and partner experience, but we are aware that the AI space is filled with larger, and better-funded teams, including those from Microsoft,\nGoogle, and others.\nIn addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small\ncompanies and individuals in all of our segments who are able to create and launch software programs and platforms for these devices using relatively limited resources and\nwith relatively limited start-up time or expertise.\nMost of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, including:\n● significantly greater financial and personnel resources;\n● stronger brand and consumer recognition;\n● longer and larger customer histories, including much more consented first-party data;\n● larger datasets from which to derive customer behavior patterns and AI training data;\n● the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;\n● more substantial intellectual property of their own;\n● lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale; and\n● broader distribution and presence.\n2\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are involved in a variety of areas that are subject to governmental oversight. While we have developed a flexible platform designed to adjust to a changing legal and\nregulatory landscape, there are a number of areas where federal, state and international law could force us to make significant adjustments to our strategies and deployment\nefforts. As such, as with many companies in both the software and advertising spaces, there are risks associated with the potential impacts of government regulation.\nAs a company that facilitates the distribution of real-world prizes for in-game and online activities, we are, in some cases and for some campaigns, subject to laws that\nsurround sweepstakes, contests, and games of skill. While we use best efforts to ensure that all contests are compliant with federal, state, and local laws pertaining to the game\ntype, contest type, prize type, and the eligibility of individual players, among other concerns, we are subject to those regulations and those regulations may change. We have\nfiled patents, and have been granted certain patent claims, protecting our ability to use player characteristics like player location, player age, and contest type to adjust eligibility\nin specific contests with the intent of providing dynamic regulatory compliance. We also have also designed the platform to make it possible to expeditiously cease providing\nprizes in certain jurisdictions, or cease offering certain types of contests, such as sweepstakes or other contest types, if that becomes necessary. If necessary, we can make these\nchanges without interruption to our campaigns and contests in other jurisdictions.\nCertain of our campaigns and contests may be subject to laws and regulations applicable to companies engaged in skill-based contests. As we partner with our brand and\ncontent partners to offer prizes that players may earn as a result of their in-game activities, we may be subject in some cases to the federal Deceptive Mail Prevention and\nEnforcement Act as well as certain state prize, gift, or sweepstakes statutes that may apply to certain experiences that we or our customers and partners may run from time to\ntime. Our system does allow us to adjust terms of service to account for this and other acts. We may also choose not to offer certain campaigns, contests or prizes in certain\nareas because of these regulations.\nIn addition, certain states prohibit, restrict, or regulate contests in a number of ways, particularly with respect to payment of entry fees, and the size, value, and/or source of\nprizes to participants in such contests. Certain other states require companies to register and/or insure certain types of contests. While we do not typically require entry fees or\nconsideration of any type from our players, and thus based on legal research conducted, are not subject to these regulations in most cases, we do remain conscious of these\nregulations. We may choose to not offer certain prizes or certain contests in certain areas due to these regulations. We can do so without interruption to other services and other\njurisdictions. While at this time, our operations are not subject to certain regulations, for example the pay-to-play regulations, given that our platform is free-to-play, we are\nconscious that because the nature of our services is relatively new and is rapidly evolving, we may not be able to accurately predict which regulations will be applied to our\nbusiness. We may also at some point become subject to new or amended regulations.\nFurther, our online in-game prizing and rewards platform, which may be integrated into games whose player bases include individuals ranging from elementary school age\nchildren to adults, is subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy and child protection. Through our applications and online platform, we, and the content creators, owners\nand platform owners that incorporate our proprietary platform into their media or hardware, may monitor and collect certain information about child users of these games and\nforums. A variety of laws and regulations have been adopted in recent years aimed at protecting children using the internet, such as the Federal Children’s Online Privacy\nProtection Rule (COPPA). COPPA sets forth, among other things, a number of restrictions related to what information may be collected with respect to children under the age\nof 13, as the kinds of content that website operators may present to children under such age. There are also a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and\nthe protection and use of information collected from individuals, particularly in relation to an individual’s personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card numbers). We\ncurrently employ multiple measures to ensure that we are COPPA-compliant. We screen for age at registration, we address the issue in our terms of service, and we employ a\nkick-out procedure during member registration whereby anyone identifying themselves as being under the age of 13 during the process may not register for a player account on\nour website or participate in any of our online experiences or tournaments without linking their account to that of a parent or guardian.\n3\nSuch regulation would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws\nrequiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption\nof minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. And while we believe that we are currently in compliance with these and\nother data protection regulations, including the privacy regulations set out below, the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in\ninterpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of our users’ personal information and related data, including the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, providing California residents increased privacy rights and protections, including the ability to opt out of\nsales of their personal information; and we are subject to the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which took effect in May 2018 and\nestablished requirements applicable to the handling of personal information of EU residents. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and exposure to liability. Other U.S.\nstates are considering adopting similar laws.\nWe post our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy on our website where we set forth our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of player data. We also\nrequire players to agree to these terms when they register for our service. Our failure to comply with our posted privacy policy or privacy related laws and regulations could\nresult in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could damage our reputation and business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws,\nand their application to the Internet is evolving and not settled. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner by various states,\ncountries and areas of the world where our users are located, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying\nnational and international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’\nprivacy and data could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of players, which could adversely impact our business.\nBased on legal research conducted, we believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations related to our business. We\ncontinually monitor our activity and changes in such laws in order to ensure, to the best extent possible, that we remain in compliance with such laws. State and federal\nregulation of internet-based activity, including online prizing and rewards, is evolving and there can be no assurance that future legislation, regulation, judicial decisions, US\nAttorney, or state attorney general actions will not restrict or prohibit activities such as those made possible by our platform.\nPatents and Licenses\nOur success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property rights. We generally rely on patent, trademark and copyright\nlaws, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we generally require employees and consultants to execute\nappropriate nondisclosure and proprietary rights agreements. These agreements acknowledge our exclusive ownership of intellectual property developed for us and require that\nall proprietary information remain confidential.\n4\nWe maintain a program designed to identify technology that is appropriate for patent and trade secret protection, and we file patent applications in the United States and,\nwhen appropriate, certain other countries for inventions that we consider significant. Our patent claims, extending and expanding on claims filed in the United States in 2014\nand internationally through the patent co-operation treaty in 2015, describe a system that seeks to match competitive game players and spectators with prizing from their\nfavorite brands through a unique conditional prize matching system.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had over 50 pending patent claims with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to expand upon our existing portfolio of prizing, promotion\nand financial technologies that enable brands to reach the rapidly growing competitive gaming audience of players, spectators and broadcasters. As of December 31, 2023, we\nhad been granted five patents.\nWe also continue to engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to use third-parties’ patents. Although our business is not materially dependent upon any one patent,\nour patent rights and the products made and sold under our patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of our business.\nIn addition to patents, we also possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, design rights and copyrights. We control access to and use\nof our software, technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers\nand partners. Our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our software, technology and other\nproprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology and other proprietary information. In addition, we have\nexpanded our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.\nCompanies in the industry in which we operate frequently are sued or receive informal claims of patent infringement or infringement of other intellectual property rights.\nWe may receive such claims from companies, including from competitors and customers, some of which have substantially more resources and have been developing relevant\ntechnology similar to ours. As and if we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may\ninfringe on our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. Successful\nclaims of infringement by a third party, if any, could result in significant penalties or injunctions that could prevent us from selling some of our products in certain markets,\nresult in settlements or judgments that require payment of significant royalties or damages or require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing products. We\ncannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights, but will not and have never\ndone so intentionally.\nCorporate History and Structure\nVersus Systems Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of British Columbia, was formed by way of an amalgamation under the name McAdam Resources, Inc. in the\nProvince of Ontario on December 1, 1988 and subsequently extra-provincially registered in British Columbia on February 2, 1989. We changed our name to Boulder Mining\nCorporation on May 9, 1995 in Ontario and on September 25, 1996 in British Columbia. We continued into British Columbia on January 2, 2007 and concurrently changed our\nname to Opal Energy Corp. We changed our name to Versus Systems Inc. on June 30, 2016, and concurrently ceased or divested our mining related business and began\noperating our current software platform business.\n5\nIn June 2021, we completed the acquisition of multimedia, production, and interactive gaming company Xcite Interactive, a provider of online audience engagement\nthrough its owned and operated XEO technology platform. We now provide products and services to multiple professional sports organizations across Major League Baseball,\nthe NHL, and the NBA to drive audience engagement.\nWe operate through our majority-owned subsidiary, Versus LLC, a Nevada limited liability company that was organized on August 21, 2013, and through our wholly\nowned subsidiary, Xcite Interactive Inc, a Delaware corporation that was reorganized as such on April 1, 2019.\nWe are in the process of considering a number of strategic alternatives for our company focused on maximizing shareholder value, including, but not limited to, an\nacquisition, merger, reverse merger, sale of assets, strategic partnership, capital raise or other transaction. We are hopeful that our change in jurisdiction from British Columbia\nto Delaware, which we expect to effect in the second quarter of 2024, will more appropriately reflect our shift in strategy and will (i) improve our access to capital markets,\nincrease funding and strategic flexibility and reduce the cost of capital, (ii) improve our ability to execute an acquisitive growth strategy using our capital stock as\nconsideration, and (iii) better focus management efforts on each U.S. and international operation and better attract and retain key employees.\nOur common shares are presently quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “VS”. In January 2023, the bid price of our common shares closed below the\nNasdaq minimum $1.00 per share requirement and on January 23, 2023 and July 25, 2023 we received notifications of noncompliance from Nasdaq. In accordance with Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were afforded until January 22, 2024 to regain compliance with the bid price requirement, which required that our common shares close at a\nprice of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. On December 28, 2023, we effected a 1-for-16 reverse stock split of our common shares, which\nincreased the closing bid price above $1.00 per share, and on January 16, 2024, Nasdaq notified us that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nOur principal executive offices in Canada are located at 1558 Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6G 3J4 Canada, and our telephone number at that address is\n(604) 639-4457. We are a distributed organization and do not maintain offices in the United States, which is the country where all of our employees reside. Our mailing address\nin the United States is located at 10866 Washington Blvd #150, Culver City, CA 90232, and our telephone number in the United States is (424) 226-8588.

All employees are subject to contractual\nagreements that specify requirements on confidentiality and restrictions on working for competitors, as well as other standard matters.\nAs of April 1, 2024, we had eight employees, including one in sales/marketing, two in engineering/product/design, one in accounts/operation, and four in\ngeneral/administrative.\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities carries a significant degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this\nAnnual Report, including our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report, before you decide to purchase our\nsecurities. Any one of these risks and uncertainties has the potential to cause material adverse effects on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results\nwhich could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements expressed by us and a significant decrease in the value of our common shares and\nwarrants. Refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nWe may not be successful in preventing the material adverse effects that any of the following risks and uncertainties may cause. These potential risks and uncertainties may\nnot be a complete list of the risks and uncertainties facing us. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that we are presently unaware of, or presently consider\nimmaterial, that may become material in the future and have a material adverse effect on us. You could lose all or a significant portion of your investment due to any of these\nrisks and uncertainties.\n7\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs we have incurred recurring losses and negative operating cash flows since our inception, and there is no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern\nabsent additional financing, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all.\nWe have incurred net losses since our incorporation in 2016 and we cannot be certain if or when we will produce sufficient revenue from our operations to support our\ncosts. Even if profitability is achieved in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability on a consistent basis. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and\nnegative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the sale of\nour existing and future products.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor sentiment. If we are\nunable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our operations or obtain funds by entering\ninto agreements on unattractive terms, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom we\nhave business relationships, at least until additional funding is obtained. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy\nprotection or other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us.\nWe do not have any credit facilities as a source of future funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms,\nor at all. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. If we raise additional funds\nthrough the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may\nhave rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting\nour ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, could increase our expenses and require that our assets secure such debt. Moreover, any debt we incur must\nbe repaid regardless of our operating results.\nWe are an early, commercial-stage company with a limited operating history.\nWe were incorporated in 2016 and we have had limited sales to date. As such, we have limited historical financial data upon which to base our projected revenue, planned\noperating expenses or upon which to evaluate our business and our commercial prospects. Based on our limited experience in developing and marketing our existing products\nand services as well as launching new products, we may not be able to effectively:\n● drive adoption of our current and future products and services;\n● attract and retain customers for our products and services;\n● provide appropriate levels of customer training and support for our products and services;\n● implement an effective marketing strategy to promote awareness of our products and services;\n● develop, manufacture and commercialize new products or achieve an acceptable return on our manufacturing or research and development efforts and expenses;\n● anticipate and adapt to changes in our market or predict future performance;\n● accommodate customer expectations and demands with respect to our products and services;\n● grow our market share by marketing and selling our products and services to new and additional market segments;\n● maintain and develop strategic relationships with vendors to acquire necessary information to our existing or future products and services;\n● adapt or scale our activities to meet potential demand at a reasonable cost;\n● avoid infringement and misappropriation of third-party intellectual property;\n8\n● obtain any necessary licenses to third-party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms;\n● obtain valid and enforceable patents that give us a competitive advantage;\n● protect our proprietary technology; and\n● attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nIf our products and services fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, we will not generate expected revenue and our business may not succeed.\nWe cannot be sure that our current or future services will gain acceptance in the marketplace at levels sufficient to support our costs. We must successfully develop and\ncommercialize our technology for use in a variety of applications. Even if we are able to implement our technology and develop products successfully, we and/or our sales and\ndistribution partners may fail to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our products across the full range of our intended applications.\nWe have a relatively limited operating history and limited revenues to date and thus are subject to risks of business development and you have only a limited basis on which\nto evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nBecause we have a relatively limited operating history and limited revenues to date, you should consider and evaluate our operating prospects in light of the risks and\nuncertainties frequently encountered by early-stage operating companies in rapidly evolving markets. These risks include:\n● that we may not have sufficient capital to achieve our growth strategy;\n● that we may not develop our product and service offerings in a manner that enables us to be profitable and meet our customers’ requirements;\n● that our growth strategy may not be successful; and\n● that fluctuations in our operating results will be significant relative to our revenues.\nOur future growth will depend substantially on our ability to address these and the other risks described in this section. If we do not successfully address these risks, our\nbusiness could be significantly harmed. To date, we have had minimal revenues. Even if we do achieve profitability, we cannot predict the level of such profitability. If we\ncontinue to sustain losses over an extended period of time, we may be unable to continue our business.\nOur recent organizational changes and cost cutting measures may not be successful.\nSince January 2023, we implemented reduction-in-force affecting approximately 62% of our workforce. The objective of this workforce reduction was to realign our\nworkforce to meet our needs and to improve operating efficiency and reduce our cash burn. However, these restructuring and cost cutting activities may yield unintended\nconsequences and costs, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction-in-force, a reduction in morale among our remaining employees, and the risk we may not achieve the\nanticipated benefits of such reduction-in-force measure, all of which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, while positions\nhave been eliminated, certain functions necessary to our reduced operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed\nemployees among our remaining employees. We may also discover the reductions in workforce and cost cutting measures will make it difficult for us to resume development\nactivities we have suspended or pursue new initiatives, requiring us to hire qualified replacement personnel, which may require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs\nand expenses. As a result of the loss of services of a significant percentage of our personnel, including one executive officer and nearly all of our full-time engineering staff, we\nmay be unable to continue our operations and meet our ongoing obligations. Any of these unintended consequences will likely have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\n9\nFuture acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business and harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may in the future explore potential acquisitions of companies or strategic investments to strengthen our business, including those of businesses larger than ours. Even if\nwe identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms or financing of the acquisition, and our due diligence may fail to identify all\nof the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n● straining our financial resources to acquire a company;\n● anticipated benefits may not materialize as rapidly as we expect, or at all;\n● diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to address acquisition integration challenges;\n● retention of employees from the acquired company or from our company;\n● cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n● integration of the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n● the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and\npolicies; and\n● litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, former shareholders or other third parties.\nFailure to appropriately mitigate these risks or other issues related to such strategic investments and acquisitions could result in reducing or completely eliminating any\nanticipated benefits of transactions, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt,\ncontingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nWe may require additional funding for our growth plans, and such funding may result in a dilution of your investment.\nWe attempted to estimate our funding requirements in order to implement our growth plans. If the costs of implementing such plans should exceed these estimates\nsignificantly or if we come across opportunities to grow through expansion plans that cannot be predicted at this time, and our funds generated from our operations prove\ninsufficient for such purposes, we may need to raise additional funds to meet these funding requirements.\nThese additional funds may be raised by issuing equity or debt securities or by borrowing from banks or other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to\nobtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we will not be able to\nimplement such plans fully if at all. Such financing even if obtained, may be accompanied by conditions that limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek lenders’\nconsent for payment of dividends, or restrict our freedom to operate our business by requiring lender’s consent for certain corporate actions.\nFurther, if we raise additional funds by way of a rights offering or through the issuance of new shares, any shareholders who are unable or unwilling to participate in such\nan additional round of fund raising may suffer dilution in their investment.\n10\nWe may not have sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations, effectively pursue our strategy or sustain our initiatives.\nOur remaining liquidity and capital resources may not be sufficient to allow us to fund our ongoing operations, effectively pursue our strategy or sustain our initiatives. The\nreport of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 stated that our recurring\nlosses from operations, accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2023, inability to achieve positive cash flows from operations and inability to fund day to day activities through\noperations indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern. If we require additional capital resources, we\nmay seek such funds directly from third party sources; however, we may not be able to obtain sufficient equity capital and/or debt financing from third parties to allow us to\nfund our expected ongoing operations or we may not be able to obtain such equity capital or debt financing on acceptable terms or conditions. Factors affecting the availability\nof equity capital or debt financing to us on acceptable terms and conditions include:\n● our current and future financial results and position;\n● the collateral availability of our otherwise unsecured assets;\n● the market’s, investors’ and lenders’ view of our industry and products;\n● the perception in the equity and debt markets of our ability to execute our business plan or achieve our operating results expectations; and\n● the price, volatility and trading volume and history of our common shares.\nIf we are unable to obtain the equity capital or debt financing necessary to fund our ongoing operations, pursue our strategy and sustain our initiatives, we may be forced to\nscale back our operations even further or our expansion initiatives, and our business and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations are significantly dependent on changes in public and customer tastes and discretionary spending patterns. Our inability to successfully anticipate customer\npreferences or to gain popularity for games may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur success depends significantly on public and customer tastes and preferences, which can be unpredictable. If we are unable to successfully anticipate customer\npreferences or increase the popularity of the games that have embedded at our platforms, the revenue and overall customer expenditures may fail to be realized, and thereby\nnegatively impact our profitability. In response to such developments, we may need to increase our marketing and product development efforts and expenditures, we may also\nadjust our product pricing, we may modify the platform itself, or take other actions, which may further erode our profit margins or otherwise adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition. In particular, we may need to expend considerable cost and effort in carrying out extensive research and development to assess the potential\ninterest in our platform and to remain abreast with continually evolving technology and trends.\nWhile we may incur significant expenditures of this nature, including in the future, there can be no assurance that any such expenditures or investments by us will yield\nexpected or commensurate returns or results, within a reasonable or anticipated time, or at all.\nIf we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements,\nour operating results could suffer.\nThe process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate\ncustomers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain\nappropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and\nservices. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. Additionally, any delay in the\ndevelopment, acquisition, marketing or launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new\ncustomers, causing a decline in our revenue or earnings.\n11\nWe have made significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\nWe have made and may continue to make investments in research, development and marketing for existing products, services and technologies, including developing a\ncontent promotion platform for brands, new feature sets for our core products, and entirely new products and platforms that we are developing for specific customers, as well as\nnew technology or new applications of existing technology. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including but not\nlimited to innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new\nfunctionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of our services or products, unfavorably affecting our revenue and profits. We may not achieve significant revenue\nfrom new product, service or distribution channel investments, or new applications of existing new product, service or distribution channel investments, for several years, if at\nall. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the\nmargins we have experienced historically. Furthermore, developing new technologies is complex and can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in\nnew releases or significant problems in creating new products or offering new services could adversely affect our revenue and profits.\nOur user base is declining, and if we fail to retain existing users or add new users, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely\naffected\nThe size of our users’ level of engagement are critical to our success. Our financial performance will be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and\nengaging active users of our products.. If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise\nmaintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render us less attractive to video game\npublishers and developers, which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any number of factors could\npotentially negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\n● users increasingly engage with competing products;\n● we fail to introduce new and improved products or if we introduce new products or services that are not favorably received;\n● we are unable to successfully balance our efforts to provide a compelling user experience with the decisions made by us with respect to the frequency, prominence, and\nsize of ads and other commercial content that we display;\n● there are changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products or concerns related to privacy and sharing, safety, security, or other factors;\n● we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\n● there are adverse changes in our products that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements or consent decrees;\n● technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience;\n● we adopt policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing our user data that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public;\n12\n● we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, developers, or advertisers; or\n● we, our software developers, or other companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity.\nIf we are unable to build and/or maintain relationships with publishers and developers or other content creators, our revenue, financial results, and future growth potential\nmay be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to keep up with industry trends or technological developments, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely\naffected.\nThe gaming industry is rapidly evolving and subject to continuous technological changes. Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement\nservices and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our\ncustomers. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make\nthe right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to\ndevelop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected. In addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment in which there\ncurrently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants. New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less\ndifferentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Technological innovations may also require\nsubstantial capital expenditures in product development as well as in modification of products, services or infrastructure. We cannot assure you that we can obtain financing to\ncover such expenditures. Failure to adapt our products and services to such changes in an effective and timely manner could materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks.\nCybersecurity risks and attacks continue to increase. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and not always predictable. Attacks include malicious software, threats to\ninformation technology infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks on websites, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other breaches. Data breaches can originate with\nauthorized or unauthorized persons. Authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information, and recipients could misuse data.\nSuch events could lead to interruption of our operations or business, unauthorized release or use of information, compromise of data, damage to our reputation, damage to our\ncustomers or vendors, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate any events.\nWe are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for our cash flows.\nWe are a holding company. All of our operations are conducted, and almost all of our assets are owned, by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flows and our ability to\nmeet our obligations depend upon the cash flows of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by these subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, distributions or otherwise.\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities, of which there\nare currently none, and legal restrictions. While there are no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us, such restrictions may arise in the future.\nAny failure to receive dividends or distributions from our subsidiaries when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial\ncondition.\n13\nOur insurance coverage may not adequately protect us against all future risks, which may adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe maintain insurance coverage, including for fire, acts of god and perils, terrorism, burglary, money, fidelity guarantee, professional liability including errors and\nomissions and breach of contract, commercial property, commercial general liability, cyber events including incident response costs, legal, forensic and breach management\ncosts, cyber-crimes, system damage, rectification costs, business interruption and reputational harm, as well as directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and employee health\nand medical insurance, with standard exclusions in each instance. While we maintain insurance in amounts that we consider reasonably sufficient for a business of our nature\nand scale, with insurers that we consider reliable and credit worthy, we may face losses and liabilities that are uninsurable by their nature, or that are not covered, fully or at all,\nunder our existing insurance policies. Moreover, coverage under such insurance policies would generally be subject to certain standard or negotiated exclusions or\nqualifications and, therefore, any future insurance claims by us may not be honored by our insurers in full, or at all. In addition, our premium payments under our insurance\npolicies may require a significant investment by us.\nTo the extent that we suffer loss or damage that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance coverage, the loss will have to be borne by us and our business,\ncash flow, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those\nlaws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business,\ninvestments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and their departure could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers. We believe that our success depends on the continued\nservice of our executive officers. We do not have key-man insurance on the life of any of our executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our\nexecutive officers could have a detrimental effect on the Company.\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial\ninterest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits\nany such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between\ntheir interests and ours.\nOur business may be harmed if our licensing partners, or other third parties with whom we do business, act in ways that put our brand at risk.\nWe offer a business-to-business software platform that allows video game publishers and developers, as well as other interactive media content creators, to offer in-game\nprizing and rewards, based on the completion of in-content challenges. We anticipate that our business partners shall be given access to sensitive and proprietary information or\ncontrol over our intellectual property in order to provide services and support to our teams. These third parties may misappropriate our information or intellectual property and\nengage in unauthorized use of it or otherwise act in a way that places our brand at risk. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, the\nfailure of third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies or the misappropriation or misuse of this information or intellectual property could result\nin a disruption to our business operations or an adverse effect on our reputation, and may negatively impact our business.\n14\nIf we fail to keep our existing users, to acquire new users, to successfully implement an award-prizes model for our user community, our business, profitability and\nprospects may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the number of users playing our partners’ games and other media and keeping our users highly engaged. Of\nparticular importance is the successful deployment and expansion of our award-prizes model to our gaming community for purposes of creating predictable recurring revenues.\nA decline in the number of our users may adversely affect the engagement level of our users, or the popularity of our award-prizes model, which may in turn reduce our\nmonetization opportunities, and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to attract and retain users, our\nrevenues may fail to grow or decline and our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position.\nWe believe that our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property are essential to our success. Please see “Business—Intellectual Property” for more\ndetails. We depend to a large extent on our ability to develop and maintain the intellectual property rights relating to our existing portfolio of prizing, promotion and financial\ntechnologies that enable brands to reach the rapidly growing competitive gaming audience of players, spectators and broadcasters. We have devoted considerable time and\nenergy to the development and improvement of our portfolio of prizing, promotion and financial technologies intellectual property.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets laws, and contractual restrictions for the protection of the intellectual property used\nin our business. Nevertheless, these provide only limited protection and the actions we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Our trade secrets\nmay become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. We may have no or limited rights to stop the use of our information by others. Moreover, to the extent\nthat our employees or third parties with whom we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights to such\nintellectual property. Preventing any unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and the steps we take may be inadequate to prevent the\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property. In the event that we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, such litigation could result in substantial costs\nand a diversion of our managerial and financial resources. We can provide no assurance that we will prevail in such litigation. Any failure in protecting or enforcing our\nintellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.\nWe cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients\nare infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or\nsolutions in the future. Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. Any claims or litigation in this area could be\ntime-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients. If we\ncannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risk of\ninfringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions.\nIn recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that\nuse such technology. Any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us. Moreover, such an action\ncould result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages.\nIn addition, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions. If we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason, including\nin the event that the software is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary\nto continue to provide such services and solutions. Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially\nadversely affect our results of operations.\n15\nThird parties may register trademarks or domain names or purchase internet search engine keywords that are similar to our trademarks, brands or websites, or\nmisappropriate our data and copy our platform, all of which could cause confusion to our users, divert online customers away from our products and services or harm our\nreputation.\nCompetitors and other third parties may purchase trademarks that are similar to our trademarks and keywords that are confusingly similar to our brands or websites in\ninternet search engine advertising programs and in the header and text of the resulting sponsored links or advertisements in order to divert potential customers from us to their\nwebsites. Preventing such unauthorized use is inherently difficult. If we are unable to prevent such unauthorized use, competitors and other third parties may continue to drive\npotential online customers away from our platform to competing, irrelevant or potentially offensive platform, which could harm our reputation and cause us to lose revenue.\nOur business is highly dependent on the proper functioning and improvement of our information technology systems and infrastructure. Our business and operating\nresults may be harmed by service disruptions, or by our failure to timely and effectively scale up and adjust our existing technology and infrastructure.\nOur business depends on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology, or IT, systems. Our IT systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption as a\nresult of fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, undetected errors in software, computer viruses, hacking and other attempts to harm our IT\nsystems. Disruptions, failures, unscheduled service interruptions or a decrease in connection speeds could damage our reputation and cause our customers and end-users to\nmigrate to our competitors’ platforms. If we experience frequent or constant service disruptions, whether caused by failures of our own IT systems or those of third-party\nservice providers, our user experience may be negatively affected, which in turn may have a material and adverse effect on our reputation and business. We may not be\nsuccessful in minimizing the frequency or duration of service interruptions. If the number of our end-users increases and more user data are generated on our platform, we may\nbe required to expand and adjust our technology and infrastructure to continue to reliably store and process content.\nWe use third-party services and technologies in connection with our business, and any disruption to the provision of these services and technologies to us could result in\nadverse publicity and a failure to maintain or grow our users, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business partially depends on services provided by, and relationships with, various third parties. We exercise no control over the third parties with whom we have\nbusiness arrangements. If such third parties increase their prices, fail to provide their services effectively, terminate their service or agreements or discontinue their relationships\nwith us, we could suffer service interruptions, reduced revenues or increased costs, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n16\nRisks Related to International Operations\nThe risks related to international operations, in particular in countries outside of the United States, could negatively affect our results.\nWe expect to incur up to 10% of our total expenses from transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, such as the Canadian dollar. As such,\nour operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign government policies and legislation or social instability and other factors which are not within our control,\nincluding, but not limited to, recessions in foreign economies, expropriation, nationalization and limitation or restriction on repatriation of funds, assets or earnings, longer\nreceivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, changes in consumer tastes and trends, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts\nor licenses, changes in gaming policies, regulatory requirements or the personnel administering them, currency fluctuations and devaluations, exchange controls, economic\nsanctions and royalty and tax increases, risk of terrorist activities, revolution, border disputes, implementation of tariffs and other trade barriers and protectionist practices,\ntaxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, volatility of financial markets and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, difficulties in the\nprotection of intellectual property particularly in countries with fewer intellectual property protections, the effects that evolving regulations regarding data privacy may have on\nour online operations, adverse changes in the creditworthiness of parties with whom we have significant receivables or forward currency exchange contracts, labor disputes and\nother risks arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted. Our operations may also be adversely affected by social,\npolitical and economic instability and by laws and policies of such foreign jurisdictions affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment. If our operations are disrupted and/or\nthe economic integrity of our contracts is threatened for unexpected reasons, our business may be harmed.\nOur international activities may require protracted negotiations with host governments, national companies and third parties. Foreign government regulations may favor or\nrequire the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. In the event of a\ndispute arising in connection with our operations in a foreign jurisdiction where we conduct our business, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or\nmay not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdictions of the courts of United States or enforcing United States judgments in such other jurisdictions. We may\nalso be hindered or prevented from enforcing our rights with respect to a governmental instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Accordingly, our\nactivities in foreign jurisdictions could be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on it.\nDoing business in the industries in which we operate often requires compliance with numerous and extensive procedures and formalities. These procedures and formalities\nmay result in unexpected or lengthy delays in commencing important business activities. In some cases, failure to follow such formalities or obtain relevant evidence may call\ninto question the validity of the entity or the actions taken. Our management is unable to predict the effect of additional corporate and regulatory formalities which may be\nadopted in the future including whether any such laws or regulations would materially increase our cost of doing business or affect our operations in any area.\nWe may in the future enter into agreements and conduct activities outside of the jurisdictions where we currently carry on business, which expansion may present\nchallenges and risks that we have not faced in the past, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and/or our financial condition.\nWe are subject to foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect our operations, and our ability to mitigate our foreign exchange risk through hedging\ntransactions may be limited.\nWe expect to incur up to 10% of our expenses in currencies other than the United States dollar; however, a substantial portion of our operating expenses are incurred in\nUnited States dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\noperating results. Our consolidated financial results are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate exposures arise from current\ntransactions and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than United States dollars and from the translation of foreign-currency-denominated balance sheet\naccounts into United States dollar-denominated balance sheet accounts. We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because portions of our revenue and expenses\nare denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, particularly the Canadian dollar. Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our operating results and\ncash flows and the value of our assets outside of the United States. If a foreign currency is devalued in a jurisdiction in which we are paid in such currency, then our customers\nmay be required to pay higher amounts for our products or services, which they may be unable or unwilling to pay. Changes in exchange rates and our limited ability or\ninability to successfully hedge exchange rate risk could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations.\n17\nWe may be unable to operate in new jurisdictions where our customers operate because of new regulations.\nWe are subject to regulation in any jurisdiction where our customers access our systems. To expand into any such jurisdiction we may need to operate according to local\nregulations. In some cases, this may require us to be licensed, or obtain approvals for our products or services. If we do not receive or receive a revocation of a license in a\nparticular jurisdiction for our products or services, we would not be able to sell or place our products or services in that jurisdiction. Any such outcome could materially and\nadversely affect our results of operations and any growth plans for our business.\nPrivacy concerns could result in regulatory changes and impose additional costs and liabilities on us, limit our use of information, and adversely affect our business.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and many other countries in which we currently operate and may operate in the future. Many federal,\nstate, and foreign legislatures and government agencies have imposed or are considering imposing restrictions and requirements about the collection, use, and disclosure of\npersonal information obtained from individuals. Changes to laws or regulations affecting privacy could impose additional costs and liability on us and could limit our use of\nsuch information to add value for customers. If we were required to change our business activities or revise or eliminate services, or to implement burdensome compliance\nmeasures, our business and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties, and potential litigation if we fail to comply with applicable\nprivacy regulations, any of which could adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate or where our customers or suppliers operate.\nWe, our customers, and our suppliers have operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and other geological events, including hurricanes,\nearthquakes, or flood that could disrupt operations. Any serious disruption at any of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers due to a natural disaster could\nhave a material adverse effect on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. If there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of our facilities, it could\nimpair our ability to adequately supply our customers, cause a significant disruption to our operations, cause us to incur significant costs to relocate or re-establish these\nfunctions and negatively impact our operating results. While we intend to seek insurance against certain business interruption risks, such insurance may not adequately\ncompensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. In addition, any natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to the operations of our\ncustomers or suppliers may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nWe are subject to various laws relating to trade, export controls, and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations, reputation,\nbusiness, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act, or the FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign\nofficials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other\npenalties. It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to\ngreater risk from their actions. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal\nproceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions. Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business. Changes in trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in\nsanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities.\n18\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export\nlicenses, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and our inability to market and sell our\nproducts or services in one or more countries. Additionally, any such violations could materially damage our reputation, brand, international expansion efforts, ability to attract\nand retain employees and our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nRegulations that may be adopted with respect to the internet and electronic commerce may decrease the growth in the use of the internet and lead to the decrease in the\ndemand for our services.\nWe may become subject to any number of laws and regulations that may be adopted with respect to the internet and electronic commerce. New laws and regulations that\naddress issues such as user privacy, pricing, online content regulation, taxation, advertising, intellectual property, information security, and the characteristics and quality of\nonline products and services may be enacted. As well, current laws, which predate or are incompatible with the internet and electronic commerce, may be applied and enforced\nin a manner that restricts the electronic commerce market. The application of such pre-existing laws regulating communications or commerce in the context of the internet and\nelectronic commerce is uncertain. Moreover, it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership and\ninfringement, libel and personal privacy are applicable to the internet. The adoption of new laws or regulations relating to the internet, or particular applications or\ninterpretations of existing laws, could decrease the growth in the use of the internet, decrease the demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business or could\notherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares and Our Warrants\nWe are subject to the continued listing criteria of Nasdaq, and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common shares or Unit A Warrants from\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market and could also jeopardize our continued ability to trade in the United States on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur common shares and Unit A Warrants are currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain the listing on Nasdaq or any other securities\nexchange we may trade on, we must maintain certain financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to\nobjective standards, Nasdaq may delist our securities if, in the exchange’s opinion, our financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the\nextent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing inadvisable; if we sell or dispose of our principal\noperating assets or cease to be an operating company; if we fail to comply with the listing requirements; or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which, in their\nopinion, makes continued listing on the exchange inadvisable.\nIf the Nasdaq were to delist our common shares, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our common\nshares, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage, and/or an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nThe trading price of our common shares has been, and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors,\nsome of which are beyond our control.\nOur share price is highly volatile. During the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a high of $26.56 per\nshare to a low of $2.37 per share. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular\ncompanies; however, the fluctuation in the price of our common shares is still larger than the stock market in general. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell\nyour common shares at or above the price at which you purchased your common shares and you may lose some or all of your investment. In addition to the general volatility\nrisks of the market, our common shares, we may experience extreme stock price volatility unrelated to our actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or\nprospects, making it difficult for prospective investors to assess the rapidly changing value of our common shares. As a company with a relatively small public float, our\ncommon shares may experience greater stock price volatility, extreme price run-ups, lower trading volume, large spreads in bid and asked prices, and less liquidity than large-\ncapitalization companies. The aspects of the trading in the common shares may be unrelated to our actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or prospects,\nmaking it difficult for prospective investors to assess the value of our common shares. Because of the low public float and the absence of any significant trading volume, the\npublic offering price may not reflect the price at which you would be able to sell shares if you want to sell any shares you own or buy shares if you wish to buy share. If the\ntrading volumes of the common shares are low, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities may easily influence the prices of the common shares. A low volume of\ntrades could also cause the price of the common shares to fluctuate greatly, with large percentage changes in price occurring in any trading day session. Broad market\nfluctuations and general economic and political conditions may also adversely affect the market price of the common shares. The volatility also could adversely affect our\nability to issue additional common shares or other securities and our ability to obtain stock market based financing in the future. No assurance can be given that an active\nmarket in our common shares will develop or be sustained.\n19\nThe market prices of our common shares and Unit A Warrants are likely to be highly volatile because of several factors, including a limited public float.\nThe market prices of our common shares and Unit A Warrants have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the prices of such securities are likely to be\nhighly volatile in the future. You may not be able to resell our common shares or Unit A Warrants following periods of volatility because of the market’s adverse reaction to\nvolatility.\nOther factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n● the absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us;\n● we may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held;\n● overall stock market fluctuations;\n● announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors;\n● actual or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms;\n● conditions or trends in the industry;\n● litigation;\n● changes in market valuations of other similar companies;\n● future sales of common shares;\n● departure of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and\n● general market conditions.\nAny of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market prices of our common shares and/or our Unit A Warrants. In addition, the stock market in\ngeneral has at times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies.\nThese broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of our common shares and/or Unit A Warrants, regardless of our actual operating performance.\n20\nOne shareholder owns a significant percentage of our common shares and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval.\nOne shareholder, Cronus Equity Capital Group, LLC (“Cronus”), beneficially owns 39.50 % of our outstanding common shares, which allows Cronus to exert substantial\ninfluence over matters such as electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. As a result, Cronus possesses substantial ability to impact\nour management and affairs and the outcome of matters submitted to shareholders for approval. In addition, this concentration of ownership and voting power may discourage,\ndelay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common shares as part of a sale of\nour company and might reduce the price of our common shares. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by our other shareholders. See “Principal Shareholders”\nfor more information.\nOur common shares have in the past been a “penny stock” under SEC rules, and our Unit A Warrants may be subject to the “penny stock” rules in the future. It may be\nmore difficult to resell securities classified as “penny stock.”\nIn the past, our common shares were a “penny stock” under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share price below US$5.00).\nWhile our common shares and Unit A Warrants are not currently considered “penny stock” because they are listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, if we are unable to maintain\nthat listing and our common shares and/or our Unit A Warrants are no longer listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, unless we maintain a per-share price above $5.00, our\ncommon shares and/or Unit A Warrants will be considered “penny stock.” These rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the\npurchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as “established customers” or “accredited investors.” For example, broker-dealers must determine the\nappropriateness for non-qualifying persons of investments in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must also provide, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from\nthe rules, a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide\nthe customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, disclose the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, furnish monthly\naccount statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account, provide a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable\ninvestment for the purchaser, and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction.\nLegal remedies available to an investor in “penny stocks” may include the following:\n● If a “penny stock” is sold to the investor in violation of the requirements listed above, or other federal or states securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel the\npurchase and receive a refund of the investment.\n● If a “penny stock” is sold to the investor in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms that committed the fraud for damages.\nThese requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules.\nThe additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely\nlimit the market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common shares or our warrants and may affect\nyour ability to resell our common shares and our Unit A Warrants.\nMany brokerage firms will discourage or refrain from recommending investments in penny stocks. Most institutional investors will not invest in penny stocks. In addition,\nmany individual investors will not invest in penny stocks due, among other reasons, to the increased financial risk generally associated with these investments.\nFor these reasons, penny stocks may have a limited market and, consequently, limited liquidity. We can give no assurance at what time, if ever, our common shares or our\nUnit A Warrants will not be classified as a “penny stock” in the future.\n21\nIf the benefits of any proposed acquisition do not meet the expectations of investors, shareholders or financial analysts, the market price of our common shares and/or Unit\nA Warrants may decline.\nIf the benefits of any proposed acquisition do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our common shares and/or Unit A Warrants\nprior to the closing of the proposed acquisition may decline. The market values of our common shares and/or Unit A Warrants at the time of the proposed acquisition may vary\nsignificantly from their prices on the date the acquisition target was identified.\nIn addition, broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common shares and/or Unit A Warrants irrespective of our operating\nperformance. The stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the\nparticular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for\nretail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress the price of our common shares and/or Unit A Warrants regardless of\nour business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional\nsecurities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our shareholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their common shares by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market\npursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, non-\naffiliate shareholders may sell freely after six months, subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell after six months, subject to the Rule 144\nvolume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information, and notice requirements. Of the approximately 2,506,015 common shares outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 1,516,112 shares were tradable without restriction. Given the limited trading of our common shares, resale of even a small number of our\ncommon shares pursuant to Rule 144 or an effective registration statement may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common shares and may not do so in the future.\nHolders of our common shares are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors. To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our common\nshares and we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of\nour business. Therefore, any return investors in our common shares may have will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market value of their common shares. See\n“Dividend Policy.”\nHolders of our warrants will have no rights as a common shareholder until they acquire our common shares.\nUntil you acquire our common shares upon exercise of your warrants, you will have no rights as a shareholder in respect of the common shares underlying such warrants.\nUpon exercise of your warrants, you will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common shareholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\nOur articles and certain Canadian legislation contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our articles could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control and limit the price that certain investors may be\nwilling to pay for our common shares. The material differences between the British Columbia Business Corporations Act, or BCBCA, and Delaware General Corporation Law,\nor DGCL, that may have the greatest such effect include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) for certain corporate transactions (such as mergers and amalgamations or\namendments to our articles) the BCBCA generally requires the voting threshold to be a special resolution approved by 66 2/3% of shareholders, whereas DGCL generally only\nrequires a majority vote; and (ii) under the BCBCA a holder of 5% or more of our common shares can requisition a special meeting of shareholders, whereas such right does\nnot exist under the DGCL.\n22\nIn addition, a non-Canadian must file an application for review with the Minister responsible for the Investment Canada Act and obtain approval of the Minister prior to\nacquiring control of a “Canadian Business” within the meaning of the Investment Canada Act, where prescribed financial thresholds are exceeded. Finally, limitations on the\nability to acquire and hold our common shares may be imposed by the Competition Act (Canada). The Competition Act (Canada) establishes a pre-merger notification regime\nfor certain types of merger transactions that exceed certain statutory shareholding and financial thresholds. Transactions that are subject to notification cannot be closed until the\nrequired materials are filed and the applicable statutory waiting period has expired or been waived by the Commissioner. However, the Competition Act (Canada) permits the\nCommissioner of Competition to review any acquisition or establishment, directly or indirectly, including through the acquisition of shares, of control over or of a significant\ninterest in us, whether or not it is subject to mandatory notification. Otherwise, there are no limitations either under the laws of Canada or British Columbia, or in our articles on\nthe rights of non-Canadians to hold or vote our common shares. Any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that\nmay have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders. We cannot predict whether investors will find our company and our common shares less attractive because we are\ngoverned by foreign laws.\nBecause we are a corporation incorporated under the laws of British Columbia and some of our directors and officers are residents of Canada, it may be difficult for\ninvestors in the United States to enforce civil liabilities against us based solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws. Similarly, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to\nenforce civil liabilities against our directors and officers residing outside of Canada.\nWe are a corporation incorporated under the laws of British Columbia. Some of our directors and officers or other experts named herein are residents of Canada and all or a\nsubstantial portion of our assets and those of such persons are located outside the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult for U.S. investors to effect service of process\nwithin the United States upon us or our directors or officers who are not residents of the United States, or to realize in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United\nStates predicated upon civil liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws. Investors should not assume that Canadian courts: (1) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts\nobtained in actions against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or blue sky laws of any state\nwithin the United States or (2) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or any such state\nsecurities or blue sky laws.\nWe have filed with the SEC to redomicile from British Columbia to Delaware, however the transaction may not be approved by shareholders, or we may abandon the effort\nbefore the transaction is consummated.\nWe filed an S-4 registration statement to redomicile from British Columbia to Delaware, but we may not receive shareholder approval to enact the move or we may\nabandon the effort before the transaction is consummated.\nAs we are a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we will be obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and\nany failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common shares.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial\nreporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until our first\nannual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. We will be required to disclose\nsignificant changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis.\nWe are beginning the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with\nSection 404, and we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we\nincur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public\ncompany experience and technical accounting knowledge and compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with\nSection 404.\n23\nDuring the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be\nunable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our\ninternal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our\nfinancial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common shares could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the\nSEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control\nsystems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to\nemerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public\ncompanies.\nWe are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from\nvarious reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply\nwith the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy\nstatements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute\npayments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth\ncompany for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates\nexceeds US$700 million as of any November 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following May 31. We cannot\npredict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our\nreliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the\ntrading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until\nprivate companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange\nAct) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period\nand comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended\ntransition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth\ncompany, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our consolidated financial\nstatements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition\nperiod difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n24\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a reporting company under the Exchange Act, and our management will continue to be required to\ndevote substantial time to compliance with our reporting company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.\nAs a reporting company under the Exchange Act, and particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” we will continue to incur significant legal,\naccounting and other expenses The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital\nMarket and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. We are also obligated to file with the Canadian securities\nregulators similar reports pursuant to securities laws and regulations applicable in all the provinces and territories of Canada in which we will be a reporting issuer. Compliance\nwith these laws and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or\ncostly. Our management and other personnel must devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase\nour legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more\nexpensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.\nWe cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional future costs we will incur as a public company or the timing of such costs.\nU.S. Holders of our common shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are treated as a passive foreign investment company.\nA non-U.S. corporation generally will be treated as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any taxable year if either (1) at\nleast 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income (such as interest income) or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values\nof the assets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. Based on the current and anticipated composition of the\nincome, assets and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, we do not believe that we will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the current taxable year or\nfor future taxable years. However, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to uncertainty in several respects, and a separate determination must be made after the close of\neach taxable year as to whether we are a PFIC for that year. Changes in the composition of our income or assets may cause us to become a PFIC. Accordingly, there can be no\nassurance that we will not be a PFIC for any taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder (as that term is defined below in “Material U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders”) holds our common shares, such U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse tax consequences. In particular, absent certain\nelections, a U.S. Holder would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at ordinary income tax rates, plus a possible interest charge, in respect of a gain derived from a\ndisposition of our common shares, as well as certain distributions by us. The PFIC rules are complex, and each prospective investor is strongly urged to consult its tax advisors\nregarding the application of these rules to such investor’s particular circumstances. See “Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders”.\nChanges to tax laws may have an adverse impact on us and holders of our common shares.\nChanges in tax laws, including amendments to tax laws, changes in the interpretation of tax laws or changes in the administrative pronouncements or positions by the CRA,\nmay also have a material adverse effect on our shareholders and their investment in our common shares. Purchasers of our common shares should consult their tax advisors\nregarding the potential tax consequences associated with the acquisition, holding and disposition of our common shares in their particular circumstances.\nITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nITEM 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nWe recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.\n25\nManaging Material Risks & Integrated Overall Risk Management\nWe have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture of cybersecurity risk\nmanagement. Our Chief Technology Officer (CTO) evaluates and addresses cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs.\nEngage Third-parties on Risk Management\nRecognizing the complexity and evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, we have engaged with a range of external experts, including cybersecurity assessors, consultants,\nand auditors in evaluating and testing our risk management systems in an ongoing and as needed basis. These partnerships enable us to leverage specialized knowledge and\ninsights, ensuring our cybersecurity strategies and processes remain at the forefront of industry best practices. Our collaboration with these third-parties includes regular audits,\nthreat assessments, and consultation on security enhancements.\nOversee Third-party Risk\nBecause we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we implement stringent processes to oversee and manage these risks. We conduct thorough\nsecurity assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. The monitoring\nincludes quarterly assessments by our CTO. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third-parties.\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats\nWe have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing.\nGovernance\nThe Board of Directors is acutely aware of the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats. The Board has established oversight mechanisms to\nensure effective governance in managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats because we recognize the significance of these threats to our operational integrity and\nstakeholder confidence,\nBoard of Directors Oversight\nThe Audit Committee is central to the Board’s oversight of cybersecurity risks and bears the primary responsibility for this domain. The Audit Committee is composed of\nboard members with diverse expertise including, risk management, technology, and finance, equipping them to oversee cybersecurity risks effectively.\nManagement’s Role Managing Risk\nThe CTO and the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) play a pivotal role in informing the Audit Committee on cybersecurity risks. The CTO keeps the CEO apprised of any\nnoteworthy activity on an ongoing basis. The CEO in turn provides comprehensive briefings to the Audit Committee on a regular basis, with a minimum frequency of once per\nyear. These briefings encompass a broad range of topics, including:\n● Current cybersecurity landscape and emerging threats;\n● Status of ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies;\n● Incident reports and learnings from any cybersecurity events; and\n● Compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards.\n26\nIn addition to our scheduled meetings, the Audit Committee and CEO maintain an ongoing dialogue regarding emerging or potential cybersecurity risks. Together, they\nreceive updates on any significant developments in the cybersecurity domain, ensuring the Board’s oversight is proactive and responsive.\nITEM 2. Properties\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1558 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC V6G 3J4 Canada. The Canada office is leased. We are a distributed organization\nand do not maintain a central office that at which our employees work. Our employees primarily work from home or from coworking spaces. We do not intend to lease\nadditional office space. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current needs and we do not believe we will encounter any difficulty in extending the terms of the lease by\nwhich we occupy our office.

Legal Proceedings\nAs of the date hereof, we are not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, executive officers or\naffiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. We may from time to time be subject to various legal\nor administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the outcome, is\nlikely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time and attention.\nITEM 4.

We have no present intention of paying any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future, as\nwe intend to use earnings, if any, to generate growth. The payment by us of dividends, if any, in the future, is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend\nupon, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as other relevant factors.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 in conjunction\nwith our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result\nof various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe offer a suite of proprietary business-to-business software tools that are meant to drive user engagement through gamification and rewards. These tools allow our\npartners to offer in-game prizing and rewards, including merchandise, coupons, digital goods, and sweepstakes entries — inside their websites, their venues, or their streaming\nmedia content.\n28\nOur customers are mostly sports teams, venues, and advertising agencies, who typically use our products as part of their live events or as part of an advertising campaign\nwith the goal of engaging fans, increasing consented first-party data, and increasing sales. At December 31, 2022, we had 16 active customers. At December 31, 2023, we had\nfive active customers.\nOur products and games are designed so that end users of our products could earn prizes by registering on our system and completing in-content challenges like trivia,\npolls, or casual mobile games. Players could use our system to play a variety of games and earn a wide range of prize types, provided by advertisers and sponsors. Our\nproducts, include our in-venue XEO and Filter Fan Cam products for live events, and our new stand-alone “Winfinite” product that can be used by brands, advertising agencies,\nand content partners to reach potential customers outside of sports venues, on mobile devices. We also have an IP portfolio that could create future licensing and product\ndevelopment opportunities including our recently allowed Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning (“ML”) series of patent claims.\nWith the acquisition of Xcite Interactive in June 2021, we acquired a number of key pieces of technology and relationships that have helped to drive our engagement and\nrewards business, including a live events fan engagement business that has partnered with professional sports franchises in the National Football League (“NFL”), the National\nBasketball Association (“NBA”), the National Hockey League (“NHL”) and others to increase audience engagement using interactive gaming functions like trivia, polling, and\ncasual games that can be played alongside live experiences whether a player is at-home, in a restaurant, or in-venue at the event itself. Our three largest customers in 2023 were\nthe San Jose Sharks, the Sacramento Kings, and ENT Marketing, a marketing agency that used our platform to promote Coca-Cola products.\nWe now have three principal software products. Our eXtreme Engagement Online or “XEO” platform is designed primarily for in-venue main-board work in stadiums and\narenas. Our Filter Fan Cam (FFC) platform is an Augmented Reality filtering tool that can be used for mobile and in-venue applications. In addition, we have a stand-alone\ngaming and prizing product that we call “Winfinite,” which allows brands, media companies, and advertising agencies to reach out to customers directly on their mobile\ndevices. We license these three software products to teams, ad agencies, and other content creators.\nSignificant Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue. In general, we recognize revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to us, where there\nis evidence of an arrangement, when the selling price is fixed or determinable, and when specific criteria have been met or there are no significant remaining performance\nobligations for each of our activities as described below. Foreseeable losses, if any, are recognized in the year or period in which the loss is determined.\nWe earn revenue through the development and maintenance of custom-built software.\nWe recognize revenues received from the development and maintenance of custom-built software and other professional services provided upon the satisfaction of our\nperformance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. Performance obligations can be satisfied\neither at a single point in time or over time. For those performance obligations that are satisfied at a single point in time, the revenue is recognized at that time. For each\nperformance obligation satisfied over time, we recognize revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation.\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are\ncapable of being distinct within the context of the contract. Determining which performance obligations are considered distinct may require significant judgment. Judgment is\nalso required to determine the amount of revenue associated with each distinct performance obligation.\nOperating Expenses. We classify our operating expense as research and development, and selling, general and administrative. Personnel costs are the primary component\nof each of these operating expense categories, which consist of cash-based personnel costs, such as salaries, benefits and bonuses. Additionally, these categories include\nintangible amortization, amortization expense, interest expense, software costs, professional fees and share-based compensation.\n29\nOperating Results\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nStatement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss Data:\nRevenue $ 271,169 $ 1,108,840\nCost of revenues 103,067 617,049\nGross Margin 168,102 491,791\nExpenses\nResearch and development 1,107,235 2,406,006\nSelling, general and administrative 5,944,909 11,838,128\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangibles 3,968,332 8,919,002\nTotal Operating Expenses 11,020,476 23,163,36\nOperating loss (10,852,374) (22,671,345)\nEmployee retention credit (354,105) -\nChange in fair value of warrant liability - (361,055)\nOther income/(expense) 13,888 162,902\nNet loss (10,512,157) (22,473,192)\nOther total comprehensive loss:\nChange in foreign currency translation, net of tax 93,317 154,970\nTotal comprehensive loss $ (10,418,840) $ (22,318,222)\nBasic and diluted earnings per share to shareholders $ (10.66) $ (192.89)\nRevenue\nOur revenues are derived from three primary sources: software licensing, professional services and advertising. Revenue was $271,169 for the year ended December 31,\n2023, representing a decrease of $847,671, or 76%, from $1,108,840 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the\nnumber of clients from 16 active clients at December 31, 2022 to five active clients at December 31, 2023.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues was $103,067 for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $513,982, or 83%, from $617,049 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease was primarily due to significant reductions in staff related to our company restructuring.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development was $1,107,235 for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $1,298,771, or 54%, from $2,406,006 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels, including a large portion of our engineering staff, and a reduction in software costs.\n30\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative was $5,944,909 for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $5,893,219, or 50%, from $11,838,128 for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels, from 39 employees at December 31, 2022 to 8 employees at December 31, 2023,\nand stock compensation expense, which decreased from $1,567,583 in 2022 to $(1,452,380) in 2023.\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was $3,968,332 for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $4,950,670 or 56% from $8,919,002\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. A number of factors influenced the performance of Xcite Interactive in 2022, including reduced revenue projections, the time and cost\ninvolved in creating custom games, the departure of key Xcite employees, and the competitive landscape of the fan engagement industry. As a result, we engaged a third-party\nto conduct an impairment analysis as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, which resulted in an $8,919,002 impairment loss in 2022. The $3,968,332 impairment as\nof December 31, 2023 was related to the impairment of capitalized software from our HP contract and platform.\nLoss from Operations\nLoss from operations was $10,852,374 for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $11,818,971, or 52%, from $22,671,345 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Decreases in salaries because of reduced staffing levels and software were somewhat offset by decreases in revenue.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nChange in fair value of the warrant liability was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of $361,055, from ($361,055) for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The warrant liability was a result of having warrants in Canadian dollars and the change in functional currency to the United States dollar on February 1,\n2021. The Canadian warrants expired in November 2022.\nInflation\nThe effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financial condition and liquidity is and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including:\n● our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;\n● future indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness;\n● the availability of public and private debt and equity financing;\n● changes in exchange rates which will impact our generation of cash flows from operations when measured in CAD; and\n● our capital expenditure requirements.\nOverview\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of approximately $10.5 million\nand $22.4 million, respectively. During such periods, we have financed our operations primarily through an initial public offering of our common shares in January 2021 and\nsubsequent public offerings, registered direct offerings, and private placements. In February 2023, we completed a registered direct offering of our common shares in which we\nreceived gross proceeds of $2.25 million and net proceeds of approximately $2 million. In October 2023, we completed a public direct offering of our common shares in which\nwe received gross proceeds of approximately $3 million and net proceeds of approximately $2.5 million. In November 2023, we completed a private placement of our equity\nsecurities in which we received gross proceeds of $2.6 million. Throughout 2023, we received approximately $4.6 million in proceeds from warrant exercises. Our cash and\ncash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 was $4.7 million. Our primary cash needs are for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to fund our operations.\n31\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a new business. We believe that our current resources and the expected revenues from operations will be\ninsufficient to fund our planned operations for the next twelve months. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 stated that our recurring losses from operations, accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2023, inability to achieve positive cash flows\nfrom operations and inability to fund day to day activities through operations indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nWe plan to increase our cash flow from our operations to address some of our liquidity concerns and are evaluating other strategic alternatives. However, to execute our\nbusiness plan and implement our business strategy, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing from time to time and may choose to raise additional funds\nthrough public or private equity or debt financings, a bank line of credit, borrowings from affiliates or other arrangements. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if\nneeded, will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Furthermore, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute our\ncurrent shareholders’ ownership in us and could also result in a decrease in the market price of our common shares. The terms of those securities issued by us in future capital\ntransactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect.\nFurthermore, any debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise\nadditional capital, when needed, to continue operations in their current form. If we cannot raise needed funds, we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our\noperating expenses, including reductions in our research and development expenses or headcount reductions, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our business\nplan and ultimately our viability as a company.\nCash Flows\nThe following summarizes the key components of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (5,471,406) $ (9,153,544)\nNet cash used in investing activities (14,514) (2,536,832)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 8,996,080 11,191,067\nNet increase (decrease) in cash $ 3,510,160 $ (499,309)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5,471,406 as compared to $9,153,544 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\ndecrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in the net loss.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $14,514 as compared to $2,536,832 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in\ncash flow used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a significant reduction in payroll capitalized for the development of intangible assets, and a reduction in the\namount of equipment purchased.\n32\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $8,996,080 for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $11,191,067 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nchange in cash flow provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to proceeds we received from the issuance of common shares, exercise of warrants and options,\nand repayments on notes payable.\nIndebtedness\nNotes Payable\nFrom 2017 to December 31, 2022, we issued $4,750,818 aggregate principal amount of promissory notes primarily to Brian Tingle, one of our directors. The notes bore\ninterest at the prime rate of the Bank of Canada, which has ranged from 2.45% to 3.95% per annum, compounded annually, that was payable quarterly, and had a maturity date\nof three years from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2023, all loans have been repaid and we had recorded $0 in accrued interest that was included in accounts payable\nand accrued liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and\nmanagement’s assessment of current events and other facts and circumstances that are considered to be relevant. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nSignificant assumptions about the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty that management has made at the end of the reporting year, that could result in a\nmaterial adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the event that actual results differ from assumptions made, relate to, but are not limited to, the following:\nEstimate for excess credit losses\nWe apply the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model under ASC 326 for impairment of financial assets. This model requires the recognition of an allowance for\ncredit losses based on expected losses over the life of the asset. If the credit risk of a financial asset decreases in a subsequent period, any previously recognized impairment\nloss is reversed through profit or loss, limited to the extent that the carrying amount does not exceed what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment not been\nrecognized.\nDeferred financing costs\nDeferred financing costs consist primarily of direct incremental costs related to our public offerings of our common stock completed in February 2023. Upon completion of\nour public offering and financing any deferred costs were offset against the proceeds.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the\nproperty and equipment. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The initial cost of property\nand equipment comprises its purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use. The purchase price\nor construction cost is the aggregate amount of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Where an item of property and\nequipment is comprised of significant components with different useful lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property and equipment. For all property\nand equipment, depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset less its residual value. Depreciation is calculated starting on the date that\nproperty and equipment is available for its intended use.\n33\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured upon initial recognition at cost, which comprises the purchase price plus any costs directly attributable to the preparation\nof the asset for its intended use. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations (Xcite Interactive) or asset acquisitions are initially recognized at fair value as at the\ndate of acquisition. After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment charges.\nWarrant liability\nEquity financing transactions may involve issuance of common shares or units. Each unit comprises a certain number of shares and a certain number of warrants.\nDepending on the terms and conditions of each equity financing transaction, the warrants are exercisable to purchase additional common shares at a price prior to expiry as\nstipulated by the transaction. Warrants that are part of units are assigned a value based on the residual value, if any.\nAs of February 1, 2021, the Canadian dollar denominated warrants were considered a derivative liability since the obligation to issue shares was not fixed in our functional\ncurrency. The derivative warrant liability was measured as fair value at issue with subsequent changes recognized in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss. A $9,743,659\nwarrant derivative loss was recorded in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss beginning February 1, 2021 when we changed our functional currency. We use the Black-\nScholes Option Pricing Model for valuation of share-based payments and derivative financial assets (e.g. investments in warrants). Option pricing models require the input of\nsubjective assumptions including expected price volatility, interest rates, and forfeiture rates. Changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and\nour earnings and equity reserves. The last set of Canadian warrants expired on November 17, 2022.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes utilizing the assets and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the\nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, using enacted tax rates\nand laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse.\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when management does not believe that the realization of DTA’s is more likely than not. While management\nbelieves that its judgements and estimates regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual results may materially affect our future\nfinancial results.\nWe recognize any uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by relevant taxing authority. An uncertain\nincome tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Our policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax\nmatters in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not record any accruals for interest and penalties. We do not foresee material changes to our\nuncertain tax positions within the next twelve months.\nDetermination of share-based payments\nThe estimation of share-based payments (including warrants and stock options) requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs\nnecessary for the valuation model chosen. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model at the date of the grant. We make estimates as to the volatility, the expected life, dividend\nyield and the time of exercise, as applicable. The expected volatility is based on the average volatility of share prices of similar companies over the period of the expected life\nof the applicable warrants and stock options. The expected life is based on historical data. These estimates may not necessarily be indicative of future actual patterns.\nDeferred revenues and revenue recognition\nRevenue recognition of sales is recorded on a monthly basis upon delivery or as the services are provided. Cash received in advance for services are recorded as deferred\nrevenue based on the proportion of time remaining under the service arrangement as of the reporting date.\nFunctional currency\nThe functional currency for each of our subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective entity operates. Such determination\ninvolves certain judgements to identify the primary economic environment. We reconsider the functional currency of our subsidiaries if there is a change in events and/or\nconditions which determine the primary economic environment.\n34\nITEM 7A.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control\nover financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment using the criteria in the updated Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework, issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our system of internal control over financial\nreporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBased on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes\nin conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's report on internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the\nSEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNone.\nITEM 9B.

Our board of directors currently consists of seven members. The term of office for each\ndirector will be until his or her successor is elected at our annual meeting or his or her death, resignation or removal, whichever is earliest to occur.\nWhile we do not have a stand-alone diversity policy, in considering whether to recommend any director nominee, including candidates recommended by shareholders, we\nbelieve that the backgrounds and qualifications of the directors, considered as a group, should provide a significant mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow\nour board of directors to fulfill its responsibilities. As set forth in our corporate governance guidelines, when considering whether directors and nominees have the experience,\nqualifications, attributes or skills, taken as a whole, to enable our board of directors to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, the\nboard of directors focuses primarily on each person’s background and experience as reflected in the information discussed in each of the directors’ individual biographies set\nforth above. We believe that our directors and director nominees will provide an appropriate mix of experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business.\nOur board of directors expects a culture of ethical business conduct. Our board of directors encourages each member to conduct a self-review to determine if he or she is\nproviding effective service with respect to both our company and our shareholders. Should it be determined that a member of our board of directors is unable to effectively act\nin the best interests of our shareholders, such member would be encouraged to resign.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur articles and our corporate governance guidelines provide our board of directors with flexibility to combine or separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and\nChief Executive Officer in accordance with its determination that utilizing one or the other structure is in the best interests of our company. Matthew Pierce currently serves as\nour Chief Executive Officer and Keyvan Peymani serves as Executive Chairman of the Board.\nAs Executive Chairman of the Board, Mr. Peymani’s key responsibilities will include facilitating communication between our board of directors and management,\nassessing management’s performance, managing board members, preparation of the agenda for each board meeting, acting as chair of board meetings and meetings of our\ncompany’s shareholders and managing relations with shareholders, other stakeholders and the public.\nWe will take steps to ensure that adequate structures and processes are in place to permit our board of directors to function independently of management. The directors\nwill be able to request at any time a meeting restricted to independent directors for the purposes of discussing matters independently of management and are encouraged to do\nso should they feel that such a meeting is required.\nForeign Private Issuer Status\nIn our annual assessment of our foreign private issuer status on June 30, 2023, we determined that we no longer meet the requirements of a foreign private issuer. As a\nresult, as of January 1, 2024, we are no longer permitted to follow the corporate governance practices of our home country (Canada) and to avail ourself of the reduced\ndisclosure requirements and applicable exemptions from U.S. securities rules and regulations. Effective on January 1, 2024, we transitioned to U.S. domestic reporting status\nand became subject to the reporting requirements of domestic U.S. issuers.\n38\nCommittees of our Board of Directors\nThe standing committees of our board of directors consist of an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee.

Our nominating and corporate governance committee will annually review the composition of our board of directors,\nincluding the age and tenure of individual directors.

Board of Directors and Shareholders:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Versus Systems Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nthe related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cashflows for the years then ended and the related notes\nto the consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,\nin all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Versus Systems Inc. as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations. In addition, the Company has not achieved positive cash flows from operations\nand is not able to finance day to day activities through operations. These events raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in\nregard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to\nbe independent with respect to Versus Systems Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Versus Systems Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged\nto perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting\nbut not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit\nCommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\nF-3\n/s/ Ramirez Jimenez International CPAs\nWe have served as Versus Systems Inc. and its subsidiaries auditors since 2021.\nIrvine, California\nApril 1, 2024\nPCAOB ID 820\nF-4\nVersus Systems Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Expressed in US Dollars)\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\n($) ($)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash 4,689,007 1,178,847\nReceivables, net of allowance for credit losses (Note 5) 18,222 60,749\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 160,474 223,226\nTotal current assets 4,867,703 1,462,822\nRestricted deposit (Note 6) 8,679 8,489\nDeposits - 100,000\nProperty and equipment, net (Note 7) 1,935 93,973\nIntangible assets (Note 10) - 6,393,364\nTotal Assets 4,878,317 8,058,648\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities (Note 11, Note 12 and Note 14) 286,427 522,012\nDeferred revenue 35,049 69,275\nNotes payable - Related Party (Note 12) - 2,604,713\nLease liability (Note 19) - 128,560\nTotal current liabilities 321,476 3,324,560\nNon-current liabilities\nTotal liabilities 321,476 3,324,560\nEquity (Deficit)\nShare capital (Note 13)\nClass A shares, no par value.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nVersus Systems Inc. (the Company) was continued under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) effective January 2, 2007. The Company’s head office and\nregistered and records office is 1558 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, V6C 3J4, Canada. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol\n“VS”. The Company’s Unit A warrants are traded on NASDAQ under “VSSYW”. On November 9, 2022, the Company completed a one-for-15 reverse stock split of the\nCompany’s common shares. On December 28, 2023, the Company completed a one-for-16 reverse stock split of the Company’s common shares. All share and per share\ndata are presented to reflect the reverse share splits on a retroactive basis.\nThe Company is engaged in the technology sector and has developed a proprietary prizing and promotions tool allowing game developers and creators of streaming media,\nlive events, broadcast TV, games, apps, and other content to offer real world prizes inside their content. The ability to win prizes drives increased levels of consumer\nengagement creating an attractive platform for advertisers.\nIn June 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of multimedia, production, and interactive gaming company Xcite Interactive, a provider of online audience\nengagement through its owned and operated XEO technology platform. The Company partners with professional sports franchises across Major League Baseball (MLB),\nNational Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Football League (NFL) to drive audience engagement.\nThe Company is in the process of considering a number of strategic alternatives for the Company focused on maximizing shareholder value, including, but not limited to,\nan acquisition, merger, reverse merger, sale of assets, strategic partnership, capital raise or other transaction. The Company is hopeful that the change in governing\njurisdiction from British Columbia to Delaware will more appropriately reflect its shift in strategy and will (i) improve our access to capital markets, increase funding and\nstrategic flexibility and reduce the cost of capital, (ii) improve the Company’s ability to execute an acquisitive growth strategy using its capital stock as consideration, and\n(iii) better focus management efforts on each U.S. and international operation and better attract and retain key employees.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern, meaning it will continue in operation for\nthe foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. Different bases of measurement may be appropriate if\nthe Company is not expected to continue operations for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not achieved positive cash flow from operations\nand is not able to finance day to day activities through operations and as such, there is substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The\nCompany’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to attain profitable operations and generate funds therefrom and/or raise equity capital or\nborrowings sufficient to meet current and future obligations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments as to the recoverability and\nclassification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These\nadjustments could be material.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nBasis of presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).\nFunctional and presentation currency\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars, unless otherwise noted, which is the functional currency of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries.\nF-9\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (continued)\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Versus Systems Inc. and its subsidiaries, from the date control was acquired. Control exists when the\nCompany possesses power over an investee, has exposure to variable returns from the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. All\ninter-company balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from inter-company transactions, are eliminated on consolidation. For partially\nowned subsidiaries, the interest attributable to non-controlling shareholders is reflected in non-controlling interest. Adjustments to non-controlling interest are accounted\nfor as transactions with owners and adjustments that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.\nProportion of\nOwnership\nName of Subsidiary Place of Incorporation Interest Principal Activity\nVersus Systems (Holdco) Inc. United States of America 81.9% Holding Company\nVersus Systems UK, Ltd. United Kingdom 81.9% Sales Company\nVersus LLC United States of America 81.9% Technology Company\nXcite Interactive, Inc. United States of America 100.0% Technology Company\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the 2022 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications have no impact\non previously reported net loss or total equity.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and\nmanagement’s assessment of current events and other facts and circumstances that are considered to be relevant. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nSignificant assumptions about the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty that management has made at the end of the reporting year, that could result in a\nmaterial adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the event that actual results differ from assumptions made, relate to, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\ni) Deferred income taxes\nDeferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilized tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate sufficient taxable\nearnings in future periods in order to utilize recognized deferred tax assets. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates\nof future cash flows. In addition, future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Company to obtain tax deductions in future periods. To the extent that future cash\nflows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be\nimpacted.\nF-10\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (continued)\nii) Economic recoverability and probability of future economic benefits of intangible assets\nManagement has determined that intangible asset costs which were capitalized may have future economic benefits and may be economically recoverable. Management\nuses several criteria in its assessments of economic recoverability and probability of future economic benefits including anticipated cash flows and estimated economic life.\niii) Valuation of share-based compensation\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for valuation of share-based compensation. Option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions\nincluding expected price volatility, interest rate, and forfeiture rate. Input assumptions changes can materially affect the fair value estimate and the Company’s earnings\n(losses).\niv) Depreciation and Amortization\nThe Company’s intangible assets and equipment are depreciated and amortized on a straight-line basis, taking into account the estimated useful lives of the assets and\nresidual values. Changes to these estimates may affect the carrying value of these assets, net loss, and comprehensive income (loss) in future periods.\nv) Determination of functional currency\nThe functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates. Determination of the\nfunctional currency may involve certain judgments to determine the primary economic environment. The functional currency may change if there is a change in events and\nconditions which determines the primary economic environment.\nvi) Revenue Recognition\nThe Company’s contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual\nperformance obligations separately if they are capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. Determining whether products and services are\nconsidered distinct performance obligations may require significant judgment. Judgment is also required to determine the stand-alone selling price, for each distinct\nperformance obligation.\nF-11\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasic and diluted loss per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during\nthe reporting periods. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share, except that the weighted average shares outstanding are\nincreased to include additional shares for the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that\noutstanding stock options and warrants were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercises were used to acquire common stock at the average market price during the\nreporting periods. Potentially dilutive options and warrants excluded from diluted loss per share as of December 31, 2023 totaled 925,635 (December 31, 2022 – 442,573).\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and any impairments. Amortization is calculated based on the estimated residual value and\nestimated economic life of the specific assets using the straight-line method over the period indicated below:\nAsset Rate\nComputers Straight line, 3 years\nRight of use assets Shorter of useful life or lease term\nFinancial instruments\nClassification\nThe Company classifies its financial instruments into the following categories: at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), at fair value through other comprehensive\nincome (loss) (FVTOCI), or at amortized cost. The classification of financial assets and liabilities is determined at initial recognition. For equity instruments, the Company\ngenerally classifies them at FVTPL. However, certain equity investments that are not held for trading may be measured at cost minus impairment if they do not have\nreadily determinable fair values. Debt instruments are classified based on the Company’s business model for managing the financial assets and their contractual cash flow\ncharacteristics. Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, unless they are required to be measured at FVTPL, such as instruments held for trading or derivatives,\nor if the Company opts to measure them at FVTPL.\nMeasurement\nThe Company applies Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires disclosures to be provided for fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n- Level 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n- Level 2-Includes other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\n- Level 3-Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nASC 820 recommends three main approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach, and the cost approach. The\nCompany uses the appropriate approach based on the nature of the asset or liability being measured. Financial instruments include Cash, Receivables, Restricted deposit,\nDeposits, Accounts payable, accruals, Warrant liabilities and Notes payable -related party. The carrying values of the financial instruments included in current assets and\nliabilities approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities. The carrying amount of long-term borrowings approximates its fair value due to the fact that the\nrelated interest rates approximate market rates for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. It is not practical to estimate the fair value of the Note payable –\nrelated party due to its related party nature.\nF-12\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nFor fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Company uses its valuation processes to decide its valuation policies and procedures\nand analyze changes in fair value measurements from period to period. For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring\nbasis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting.\nFinancial assets and liabilities at amortized cost\nFinancial assets and liabilities at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value plus or minus transaction costs, respectively, and subsequently carried at amortized\ncost less any impairment.\nFinancial assets and liabilities at FVTPL\nFinancial assets and liabilities carried at FVTPL are initially recorded at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in profit or loss. Realized and unrealized gains and\nlosses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities held at FVTPL are included in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\nImpairment of financial assets at amortized cost\nThe Company applies the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model under ASC 326 for impairment of financial assets. This model requires the recognition of an\nallowance for credit losses based on expected losses over the life of the asset. If the credit risk of a financial asset decreases in a subsequent period, any previously\nrecognized impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss, limited to the extent that the carrying amount does not exceed what the amortized cost would have been had\nthe impairment not been recognized.\nIntangible assets excluding goodwill\nDerecognition of financial assets\nThe Company derecognizes financial assets only when the contractual rights to cash flows from the financial assets expire, or when it transfers the financial assets and\nsubstantially all of the associated risks and rewards of ownership to another entity. Gains and losses on derecognition are generally recognized in profit or loss.\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Company does not have any derivative financial assets and liabilities.\nIntangible assets acquired separately are carried at cost at the time of initial recognition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognized separately\nfrom goodwill are initially recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date. Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is\nincurred.\nIntangibles with a finite useful life are amortized and those with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. The useful life is the best estimate of the period over which the\nasset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company. The useful life is based on the duration of the expected use of the asset by the\nCompany and the legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that constrain the useful life and future cash flows of the asset, including regulatory acceptance and approval,\nobsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. If an income approach is used to measure the fair value of an intangible asset, the Company considers the\nperiod of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible asset, adjusted as appropriate for Company-specific factors discussed above, to determine the\nuseful life for amortization purposes. If no regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors limit the useful life of the intangible to the Company, the useful\nlife is considered indefinite.\nF-13\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nIntangibles with a finite useful life are amortized on the straight-line method unless the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or used\nup are reliably determinable. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether any revision to the\nremaining useful life is required. If the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over the\nrevised remaining useful life. The Company’s intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years. In the year development costs are incurred, amortization\nis based on a half year.\nGoodwill\nThe Company allocates goodwill arising from business combinations to reporting units that are expected to receive the benefits from the synergies of the business\ncombination. The carrying amount reporting units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested annually for impairment or when there is an indication that the goodwill\nmay be impaired. Any impairment is recognized as an expense immediately.\nDeferred financing costs\nDeferred financing costs consist primarily of direct incremental costs related to the Company’s public offering of its common stock. Upon completion of the Company’s\nfinancings any deferred costs were offset against the proceeds.\nImpairment of intangible assets excluding goodwill\nThere are special requirements for the development of software to be sold. The costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of the software that will be sold are\nexpensed as research and development when incurred. Once technological feasibility has been achieved, the Company capitalizes the remaining costs incurred to develop\nthe software for sale. Costs are capitalized until the product is ready to be sold or marketed to customers, at which time, amortization of the capitalized costs begins.\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have\nsuffered impairment losses. If any such indication exists, fair value of the reporting unit or an asset group to which the asset belongs is estimated in order to determine the\nextent of the impairment losses (if any).\nIf the fair value of an asset (or an asset group/reporting unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or an asset group/reporting\nunit ) is reduced to fair value.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the assets and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences\nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, using\nenacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse.\nF-14\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets in these cases then management does not believe that the realization is more likely than not. While\nmanagement believes that its judgements and estimates regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual results may materially\naffect the Company’s future financial results.\nThe Company recognizes any uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by relevant taxing authority. An\nuncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties\nrelated to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record any accruals for interest and penalties. The Company\ndoes not foresee material changes to its uncertain tax positions within its next twelve months. The Company’s tax years are subject to examination for 2020 and forward for\nU.S. Federal tax purposes and for 2019 and forward for state tax purposes.\nLeases\nThe Company early adopted ASC 842, Leases, as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective application.\nThe Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of\ntime in exchange for consideration. The lease term corresponds to the non-cancellable period of each contract.\nAll leases are accounted for as operating leases wherein rental payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the periods of their respective leases. Operating leases\n(with an initial term of more than 12 months) are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, operating lease liabilities (current), and operating lease liabilities\n(non-current) in the consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the\nCompany’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the\npresent value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company utilizes a market-based approach to estimate the incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease prepayments, reduced by lease\nincentives and accrued rent. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nLoss contingencies\nA loss contingency is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable\nthat an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Loss contingencies are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax\nrate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.\nNon-controlling interest\nNon-controlling interest in the Company’s less than wholly owned subsidiaries are classified as a separate component of equity. On initial recognition, non-controlling\ninterest is measured at the fair value of the non-controlling entity’s contribution into the related subsidiary. Subsequent to the original transaction date, adjustments are\nmade to the carrying amount of non-controlling interest for the non-controlling interest’s share of changes to the subsidiary’s equity.\nF-15\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nChanges in the Company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are recorded as equity transactions. The carrying amount of non-\ncontrolling interest is adjusted to reflect the change in the non-controlling interest’s relative interest in the subsidiary, and the difference between the adjustment to the\ncarrying amount of non-controlling interests and the Company’s share of proceeds received and/or consideration paid is recognized directly in equity and attributed to\nowners of the Company.\nValuation of Equity Units Issued in Private Placements\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, particularly ASC 505-10 and ASC 815, the Company has adopted the fair value method for the valuation of equity units issued in private\nplacements, which typically comprise common shares and warrants. For each private placement, the Company separately estimates the fair value of both the common\nshares and the warrants at the date of issuance. The determination of fair value is based on market conditions, volatility, and other relevant factors at the time of issuance.\n1. Common Shares: The fair value of the common shares issued is measured based on observable market prices, if available, or estimated using appropriate valuation\ntechniques considering the terms of the shares and market conditions.\n2. Warrants: Warrants are valued using an appropriate option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes or a binomial model. The model incorporates various inputs,\nincluding the share price, expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and any dividends.\nThe total proceeds from the issuance of equity units are allocated between the common shares and the warrants based on their relative fair values at the date of issuance.\nThis allocation is reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet, with the fair value of the warrants recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital in the equity\nsection. If the warrants expire unexercised, the amount remains in additional paid-in capital.\nThis method of valuation and allocation ensures compliance with the fair value measurement and equity classification requirements of U.S. GAAP.\nWarrants issued in equity financing transactions\nThe Company engages in equity financing transactions to obtain funds necessary to continue operations. These equity financing transactions may involve issuance of\ncommon shares or units. Each unit comprises a certain number of shares and a certain number of warrants. Depending on the terms and conditions of each equity financing\ntransaction, the warrants are exercisable into additional common shares at a price prior to expiry as stipulated by the transaction.\nWarrants that are part of units are assigned a value based on the residual value, if any.\nAs of February 1, 2021, the warrants were considered a derivative liability since the obligation to issue shares was not fixed in the Company’s functional currency. The\nderivative warrant liability was measured as fair value at issue with subsequent changes recognized in the consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss. A\n$9,743,659 warrant derivative loss was recorded in the consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss beginning February 1, 2021 when the Company changed its\nfunctional currency. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 the associated warrants have expired and the remaining balance of the warrant liability is $0.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for valuation of share-based payments and derivative financial assets (e.g. investments in warrants). Option\npricing models require the input of subjective assumptions including expected price volatility, interest rates, and forfeiture rates. Changes in the input assumptions can\nmaterially affect the fair value estimate and the Company’s earnings.\nF-16\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nShare-based compensation\nThe Company grants stock options to acquire common shares of the Company to directors, officers, employees and consultants. An individual is classified as an employee\nwhen the individual is an employee for legal or tax purposes, or provides services similar to those performed by an employee.\nThe fair value of stock options is measured on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is recognized over the vesting period. Consideration\npaid for the shares on the exercise of stock options is credited to capital stock.\nIn situations where equity instruments are issued to non-employees and some or all of the goods or services received by the Company as consideration cannot be\nspecifically identified, they are measured at fair value of the share-based payment. Otherwise, share-based payments are measured at the fair value of goods or services\nreceived.\nRevenue recognition\nIn general, the Company recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Company,\nwhere there is evidence of an arrangement, when the selling price is fixed or determinable, and when specific criteria have been met or there are no significant remaining\nperformance obligations for each of the Company’s activities as described below. Foreseeable losses, if any, are recognized in the year or period in which the loss is\ndetermined.\nThe Company earns revenue in two primary ways: 1) the sales of software-as-a-service (SAAS) from its interactive production software platform or 2) development and\nmaintenance of custom-built software or other professional services.\nThe Company recognizes SAAS revenues from its interactive production sales over the life of the contract as its performance obligations are satisfied. Payment terms vary\nby contract and can be periodic or one-time payments.\nThe Company recognizes revenues received from the development and maintenance of custom-built software and other professional services provided upon the satisfaction\nof its performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. Performance\nobligations can be satisfied either at a single point in time or over time. For those performance obligations that are satisfied at a single point in time, the revenue is\nrecognized at that time. For each performance obligation satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of\nthat performance obligation.\nFor revenues received from the sales of advertising, the Company is deemed the agent in its revenue agreements. The Company does not own or obtain control of the\ndigital advertising inventory. The Company recognizes revenues upon the achievement of agreed-upon performance criteria for the advertising inventory, such as a number\nof views, or clicks. As the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction, the Company recognizes revenue from sales of advertising on a net basis, which excludes\namounts payable to partners under the Company’s revenue sharing agreements.\nThe Company’s contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual\nperformance obligations separately if they are capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. Determining whether products and services are\nconsidered distinct performance obligations may require significant judgment. Judgment is also required to determine the stand-alone selling price, for each distinct\nperformance obligation.\nDeferred revenue\nRevenue recognition of sales is recorded on a monthly basis upon delivery or as the services are provided. Cash received in advance for services are recorded as deferred\nrevenue based on the proportion of time remaining under the service arrangement as of the reporting date.\nF-17\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nForeign exchange\nThe functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates and has been determined for each entity within the\nCompany. The functional currency for the Company and its subsidiaries is the United States dollar. The functional currency determinations were conducted through an\nanalysis of the consideration factors identified in ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters.\nForeign currency transactions in currencies other than the United States dollar are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency\ntransaction gains and losses are generally recognized in profit or loss and presented within gain (loss) on foreign exchange.\nAt the end of each reporting period, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the\nrate of exchange at the date of the consolidated balance sheet. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at historical\nrates. Revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates approximating those in effect on the date of the transactions.\nForeign currency translation gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity on the consolidated statement of changes in\nstockholders’ equity (deficit).\nComprehensive income (loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) and represents the change in shareholders’ equity (deficit) which results\nfrom transactions and events from sources other than the Company’s shareholders. Comprehensive loss differs from net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to\nthe effects of foreign translation gains and losses.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nNew accounting pronouncements\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements. This ASU clarifies leasing transactions among entities under\ncommon control, emphasizing the use of written terms for lease existence and classification. It is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating how this will impact its consolidated financial statements and\ndisclosures.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using\nthe Proportional Amortization Method. This ASU expands the proportional amortization method to additional types of tax equity investments. It allows entities to apply\nthis method to a broader range of investments that generate tax credits, providing greater flexibility in accounting for these investments. ASU 2023-02 is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating how this ASU will impact its\nconsolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-03, which amends various SEC paragraphs in the Accounting Standards Codification. This includes amendments to\nPresentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480),\nEquity (Topic 505), and Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The amendments are in response to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120 and other SEC staff\nannouncements and guidance. This ASU does not introduce new guidance and therefore does not have a specified transition or effective date. However, for smaller\nreporting companies, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating how this ASU will impact its\nconsolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, Business Combinations—Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement. This ASU\naddresses accounting for assets and liabilities contributed to a joint venture. It requires entities to recognize and measure these contributions at fair value as of the joint\nventure formation date. This ASU is applicable to all entities involved in forming joint ventures and is effective for joint ventures formed on or after January 1, 2025.\nEntities may choose to apply these amendments retrospectively if sufficient information is available. The Company is currently evaluating how this ASU will impact its\nconsolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification\nInitiative. This ASU introduces changes to the disclosure requirements, aligning them more closely with the SEC's initiatives for simplification and update. It specifically\naddresses various amendments in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification in response to the SEC's drive for clearer and more streamlined disclosures. This ASU is\neffective for public business entities classified as smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating\nhow this ASU will impact its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU enhances the\ndisclosures related to segment reporting for public entities. It requires entities to disclose significant segment expenses for each reportable segment, providing greater\ntransparency in segment performance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.

It also mandates additional\ndisclosures about crypto asset holdings. This ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those\nyears. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating how this ASU will impact its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU enhances the transparency and\ndecision usefulness of income tax disclosures. It is designed to provide more detailed information about an entity’s income tax expenses, liabilities, and deferred tax items,\npotentially affecting how companies report and disclose their income tax-related information. The ASU is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating how this ASU will impact its consolidated financial\nstatements and disclosures.\nRecent adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the\nsubsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the\nimplied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business\ncombination. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a\nreporting unit with its carrying amount. The FASB also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative\nassessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. It is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the amendments in this update during the current year and the adoption did not have a material\nimpact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with\nCustomers, which provides an exception to fair value measurement for contract assets and contract liabilities related to revenue contracts acquired in a business\ncombination. ASU 2021-08 requires an entity (acquirer) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance\nwith Topic 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contract. It is\neffective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the amendments in this\nupdate during the current year and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which\nsignificantly changes how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments. ASU 2016-13 introduces a new model for recognizing\ncredit losses, known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the CECL model, entities will\nbe required to estimate all expected credit losses over the life of the asset. This update applies to all entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not\naccounted for at fair value through net income. This ASU is effective for public business entities classified as smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022. The Company adopted the amendments in this update during the current year and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated\nfinancial statements and disclosures.\nManagement does not believe any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncement, if adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s present\nor future consolidated financial statements.\n4. CHANGE IN FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY\nThe Company changed its functional currency from the Canadian dollar (CAD) to the United States dollar (USD) as of February 1, 2021. The change in functional\ncurrency coincided with the January 2021 initial public offering and listing on the Nasdaq.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its payment obligations. The Company has no material\ncounterparties to its financial instruments with the exception of the financial institutions which hold its cash. The Company manages its credit risk by ensuring that its cash\nis placed with a major financial institution with strong investment grade ratings by a primary ratings agency. The Company’s receivables consist of goods and services due\nfrom customers and tax due from the Canadian government.\nFinancial instrument risk exposure\nThe Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board approves and monitors the risk management processes.\nLiquidity risk\nThe Company’s cash is invested in business accounts which are available on demand. The Company has raised additional capital during the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company’s bank account earns interest income at variable rates. The fair value of its portfolio is relatively unaffected by changes in short-term interest rates.

MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL\nThe Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, based on the funds available to the Company. Capital consists of items within equity (deficit). The\nBoard of Directors does not establish quantitative return on capital criteria for management, but rather relies on the expertise of the Company’s management to sustain\nfuture development of the business. The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.\nThe Company remains dependent on external financing to fund its activities. In order to sustain its operations, the Company will spend its existing cash on hand and raise\nadditional amounts as needed until the business generates sufficient revenues to be self-sustaining. Management reviews its capital management approach on an ongoing\nbasis and believes that this approach, given the relative size of the Company, is reasonable.\nIn order to maximize ongoing corporate development efforts, the Company does not pay out dividends. The Company’s investment policy is to keep its cash treasury\ninvested in certificates of deposit with major financial institutions.\nThere have been no changes to the Company’s approach to capital management during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nF-30\nVERSUS SYSTEMS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(Expressed in United States dollars)\n17.

INCOME TAXES (continued)\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on an assessment of positive and negative\nevidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the\ncumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2023. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as its\nprojections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, a valuation allowance of $23.7 million and $20.9 million, respectively, has\nbeen recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has accumulated federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $30.1 million and $15.6 million, respectively.\nThe significant components of the Company’s temporary differences, unused tax credits and unused tax losses that have not been included on the consolidated balance\nsheets are as follows:\nTemporary Differences 2023 Expiry Date Range 2022 Expiry Date Range\n($) ($)\nNon-capital losses available for future periods - US 45,697,000 2036 to indefinite 41,188,000 2036 to indefinite\nNon-capital losses available for future periods - Canada 22,862,000 2026 to 2043 21,739,000 2026 to 2041\nAllowable capital losses 13,463,000 No expiry date 13,178,000 No expiry date\nProperty and equipment 280,000 No expiry date 270,000 No expiry date\nIntangible assets 9,747,000 No expiry date 2,962,000 No expiry date\nExploration and evaluation assets 5,446,000 No expiry date 5,446,000 No expiry date\nShare issuance costs 2,715,000 No expiry date 2,922,000 No expiry date\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various states along with other foreign countries. The Company has not been notified that it is under audit by\nthe IRS or any state, however, due to the presence of NOL carryforwards, all the income tax years remain open for examination in each of these jurisdictions. There are no\naudits in any foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase\nor decrease in the next 12 months.\nDeferred income taxes have not been provided for undistributed earnings of the Company’s consolidated foreign subsidiaries because of the Company’s intent to reinvest\nsuch earnings indefinitely in active foreign operations.\nTax attributes are subject to review, and potential adjustment, by tax authorities.

TIMELY DISCLOSURE OF MATERIAL INFORMATION\n8.1 Material Information. “Material Information” consists of both Material Facts and Material Changes. A “Material Fact” means a fact that significantly affects, or\nwould reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on, the market price or value of the securities of the Company. A “Material Change” means a change in the\nbusiness, operations or capital of the Company that would reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of any of the securities of\nthe Company and includes a decision to implement such a change, if such a decision is approved by the Board or by senior management of the Company, who believe\nthat confirmation of the decision by the Board is probable.\n9\n8.2 Disclosure of Material Information. Any person to whom this Policy applies who becomes aware of information that has the possibility of being Material\nInformation must immediately disclose that information to the President and Chief Executive Officer and/or the Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer.\nSchedule B attached hereto lists examples of Material Information.\n8.3 Material Change. Upon the occurrence of any change that may constitute a Material Change in respect of the Company, the Disclosure Committee, in consultation\nwith such other advisors as it may consider necessary, shall:\n(a) consider whether the event constitutes a Material Change;\n(b) if it does constitute a Material Change, prepare a press release and a material change report describing the Material Change as required under applicable laws;\n(c) determine whether a reasonable basis exists for filing the material change report on a confidential basis. In general, filings will not be made on a confidential\nbasis although, in exceptional circumstances (such as disclosure related to a potential acquisition), confidential disclosure may be appropriate;\n(d) to the extent practicable, circulate the draft press release and material change report to the members of the Board and senior management, together, if\napplicable, with the recommendation that it be filed on a confidential basis; and\n(e) if applicable, following approval by the Disclosure Committee, file the Material Change report on a confidential basis and when the basis for confidentiality\nceases to exist, and the event remains material, issue a press release and file a material change report in compliance with applicable securities laws, including\nthe Disclosure Rules. During the period of time while a confidential material change has not been publicly disclosed, the Company shall not release a\ndocument or make a Public Oral Statement that, due to the Undisclosed Material Change, contains a Misrepresentation.\n8.4 Press Releases. Press releases disclosing Material Information will be transmitted to the relevant regulatory bodies and major news wire services that disseminate\nfinancial news to the financial press.\n9. INTERNET CHAT ROOMS AND BULLETIN BOARDS\nDirectors, Officers, Employees and Contractors must not discuss or post any information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or trading in securities of\nthe Company in Internet chat rooms, news groups or bulletin boards.\n10\n10. RUMOURS\nThe Company shall not comment, affirmatively or negatively, on rumours. This also applies to rumours on the Internet. Spokespersons will respond consistently to\nthose rumours, saying “It is our policy not to comment on market rumours or speculation.” If any relevant stock exchange or securities regulatory authority requests\nthat the Company make a statement in response to a market rumour, the Disclosure Committee will consider the matter and make a recommendation to the President\nand Chief Executive Officer or, failing his or her availability, to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as to the nature and context of any response.\n11. WEBSITE\n11.1 Creating and Maintaining Company Website. The Company will designate a person or persons who will be responsible for posting financial information, press\nreleases and other reports filed with securities regulatory authorities on the Company’s website. The Company’s website must be maintained in accordance with the\nfollowing:\n(a) the following information should be included on the website:\n(i) all Material Information that has previously been Generally Disclosed, including, without limitation, all documents filed on SEDAR or a link to\nthose documents on SEDAR,\n(ii) all non-Material Information that is given to analysts, institutional investors and other market professionals (such as fact sheets, fact books, slides of\ninvestor presentations, materials distributed at analyst and industry conferences),\n(iii) web replays of shareholder meetings or analysts’ conferences, and\n(iv) all press releases or a link to those press releases;\n(b) the website must contain an e-mail link to an investor relations contact for the Company to facilitate communication with investors;\n(c) the website must include a notice that advises the reader that the information was accurate at the time of posting, but may be superseded by subsequent\ndisclosures;\n(d) inaccurate information must be promptly removed from the website and a correction must be posted;\n(e) information contained on the website should be removed or updated when it is no longer current;\n(f) a list of all analysts known to follow the Company may be posted on the investor relations page, but analysts’ reports must not be posted on the Company’s\nwebsite or linked to the Company’s website;\n11\n(g) all links from the Company’s website must be approved by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer and all links must include a\nnotice that advises the reader that he or she is leaving the Company’s website and that the Company is not responsible for the contents of the other site; and\n(h) no links will be created from the Company’s website to chat rooms, newsgroups or bulletin boards.\n11.2 Website Information. All information on the Company’s website will be retained for a period of six years from the date of posting.\n12. CONFIDENTIALITY OF UNDISCLOSED MATERIAL INFORMATION\n12.1 Undisclosed Material Information. “Undisclosed Material Information” of the Company is Material Information about the Company that has not been “Generally\nDisclosed”, that is, disseminated to the public by way of a press release, together with the passage of a reasonable amount of time following such dissemination (24\nhours, unless otherwise advised that the period is longer or shorter, depending on the circumstances) for the public to analyze the information.\n12.2 Confidentiality of Undisclosed Material Information. Any person to whom this Policy applies and who has knowledge of Undisclosed Material Information must\ntreat the Material Information as confidential until the Material Information has been Generally Disclosed.\n12.3 Disclosure of Undisclosed Material Information. Undisclosed Material Information shall not be disclosed to anyone except in the necessary course of business. If\nUndisclosed Material Information has been disclosed in the necessary course of business, anyone so informed must clearly understand that it is to be kept confidential,\nand, in appropriate circumstances, execute a confidentiality agreement. Schedule C attached hereto lists circumstances where Canadian securities regulators believe\ndisclosure may be in the necessary course of business. When in doubt, all persons to whom this Policy applies must consult with the Chief Executive Officer and/or\nChief Financial Officer and/or General Counsel to determine whether disclosure in a particular circumstance is in the necessary course of business. For greater\ncertainty, disclosure to analysts, institutional investors, other market professionals and members of the press and other media will not be considered to be in the\nnecessary course of business. “Tipping”, which refers to the disclosure of Undisclosed Material Information to third parties outside the necessary course of business,\nis prohibited.\nWhen Undisclosed Material Information is disclosed to a third party in the necessary course of business, it is prudent for the Company to obtain, in appropriate\ncircumstances, written agreement from the third party that such party will not divulge the information to anyone (other than to directors, officers or other employees of\nthe third party who need to know the information for the purposes for which the Undisclosed Material Information was communicated to them) without written\nauthorization from the Company and that the third party understands the restrictions under applicable law not to purchase or sell securities of the Company, or\nsecurities or related financial instruments of any other entity to which the information relates, until the transaction, development or event has been Generally Disclosed\nor has been abandoned.\n12\n12.4 Inadvertent Disclosure. In order to prevent the misuse of inadvertent disclosure of Undisclosed Material Information, the procedures set forth below should be\nobserved at all times:\n(a) Documents and files containing confidential information should be kept in a safe place to which access is restricted to individuals who “need to know” that\ninformation in the necessary course of business and code names should be used, if necessary;\n(b) Confidential matters should not be discussed in places where the discussion may be overheard;\n(c) Transmission of documents containing Undisclosed Material Information by electronic means will be made only where it is reasonable to believe that the\ntransmission can be made and received under secure conditions; and\n(d) Unnecessary copying of documents containing Undisclosed Material Information must be avoided and extra copies of documents must be promptly removed\nfrom meeting rooms and work areas at the conclusion of the meeting and must be destroyed, if no longer required.\n13. QUIET PERIOD\n13.1 Any General Blackout period or Specific Blackout Period, as stipulated in section 16, will be a “Quiet Period”. During a Quiet Period, Spokespersons must not provide\nany Forward-Looking Information relating to the business and affairs of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including information relating to expected revenues,\nnet income or profit, earnings per share, expenditure levels, and other information commonly referred to as earnings guidance (“Earnings Guidance”) or comments\nwith respect to the financial results for the current fiscal quarter or current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these restrictions, the Company may Generally Disclose\nForward-Looking Information during the Quiet Period when the Forward-Looking Information constitutes Undisclosed Material Information. During a Quiet Period,\nSpokespersons may respond to unsolicited inquiries about information either that is not Material Information or that has been Generally Disclosed.\n14. AVOIDING SELECTIVE DISCLOSURE\n14.1 Selective Disclosure. When participating in shareholder meetings, news conferences, conference calls, webcasts, analysts’ conferences and private meetings with\nanalysts or institutional investors, Spokespersons must only disclose information that either:\n(a) is not Material Information; or\n(b) is Material Information but has previously been Generally Disclosed.\nFor greater certainty, acceptable topics of discussion include the Company’s business prospects (subject to the provisions of this Policy), the business environment,\nmanagement’s philosophy and long-term strategy. Any selective disclosure of Undisclosed Material Information, including Earnings Guidance, is not permitted.\n13\n14.2 Protection Against Selective Disclosure. To protect against selective disclosure, the procedures outlined in Section 6 (Procedures Regarding Public Oral Statements)\nshould be followed.\n14.3 Legal Obligations with Respect to Selective Disclosure of Material Information. If Material Information that has not been Generally Disclosed is inadvertently\ndisclosed, the Disclosure Committee must take immediate steps to ensure that the Undisclosed Material Information is Generally Disclosed, must immediately report\nthe circumstances to the Board and must immediately issue a press release regarding the Undisclosed Material Information. Pending the Undisclosed Material\nInformation being Generally Disclosed, the Company must, promptly and using reasonable means, contact the parties to whom the Material Information was disclosed\nand inform them:\n(a) that the Material information is Undisclosed Material Information; and\n(b) of their legal obligations with respect to the Undisclosed Material Information.\n15. ANALYST REPORTS\n15.1 Identification of Factual Information. When reviewing analysts’ reports, comments of Directors, Officers, Employees and Contractors must be limited to identifying\nfactual information that has been Generally Disclosed that may affect an analyst’s model and pointing out inaccuracies or omissions with respect to factual information\nthat has been Generally Disclosed.\nAny comments must contain a disclaimer that the report was reviewed for factual accuracy only. No comfort or guidance shall be expressed on the analysts’ earnings\nmodels or earnings estimates and no attempt shall be made to influence an analyst’s opinion or conclusion.\n15.2 Analysts’ Reports. Analysts’ reports shall not be posted on or linked from the Company’s website.\n15.3 Earnings Guidance. The Company may, from time to time, give Earnings Guidance or any other Forward-Looking Information through voluntary disclosure by way\nof a press release, provided that the cautionary language described in Section 5.7 accompanies the information.\n16. TRADING OF SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY\n16.1 Purchase or Sale of Securities. No Person in a Special Relationship with the Company (as defined in Schedule A to this Policy) shall purchase, sell or otherwise\nmonetize securities of the Company while in possession of Undisclosed Material Information.\n16.2 General Blackout. All Directors, Officers, Employees and Contractors are prohibited from purchasing or selling securities of the Company for the period of time\nbeginning on the 7th day following the end of a fiscal quarter or year until the second Trading Day following release of such Document or press release (the “General\nBlackout”).\n14\n16.3 Specific Blackout. All Directors, Officers, Employees and Contractors who are so advised by the Disclosure Committee shall be prohibited from trading in the\nsecurities of the Company during any other period designated by the Disclosure Committee (the “Specific Blackout”).\n16.4 Consent of the President and Chief Financial Officer. Notwithstanding Sections 16.2 and 16.3, a Director, Officer, Employee and Contractor may trade in the\nsecurities during any blackout period (a General Blackout, or Specific Blackout as may be applicable) with the prior written consent of the President and Chief\nExecutive Officer and/or the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. If the President and Chief Executive Officer and/or the Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer wish to effect a trade in the securities during any blackout period (a General Blackout, or Specific Blackout as may be applicable), they shall require the prior\nwritten consent of the Board. The President and Chief Executive Officer and/or the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, may grant permission to trade in the\nsecurities during a blackout period only in the case of unusual, exceptional circumstances and where such trading is otherwise not prohibited under applicable law.\nUnusual, exceptional circumstances may include the trading in securities in the case of severe financial hardship or where the timing of the sale is critical for\nsignificant tax planning purposes.\n16.5 Other Issuers. Illegal insider trading in securities of another public issuer and Tipping of Undisclosed Material Information relating to another issuer can bring the\nCompany into disrepute. Accordingly, neither the Company nor anyone subject to this Policy who possesses undisclosed material information relating to that other\nissuer may:\n(a) purchase or sell securities or related financial instruments of the other issuer while they possess the Undisclosed Material Information;\n(b) engage in Tipping of the Undisclosed Material Information relating to the other issuer; or\n(c) recommend or encourage another person to purchase or sell securities of the other issuer or transact in a related financial instrument while they possess\nUndisclosed Material Information.\n16.6 Speculative and Short Sales. No person to whom this Policy applies may purchase or sell securities of the Company with the intention of reselling or repurchasing in\na relatively short period of time in the expectation of a short-term rise or fall in the market price of the securities of the Company. Speculating in securities of the\nCompany for short term profit is distinguished from purchasing and selling securities of the Company as part of a long term investment program. No one subject to\nthis Policy may, at any time, sell securities of the Company short or buy or sell call or put options in respect of securities of the Company.\n15\n17. INSIDER REPORTS\nFiling of Initial Insider Report. A Reporting Insider (unless they own no securities of the Company) will have to file an initial insider report within 10 days of\nbecoming a Reporting Insider disclosing the Reporting Insider’s beneficial ownership of, or control or direction over, whether direct or indirect, securities of the\nCompany and interest in, or right or obligation associated with, a related financial instrument involving a security of the Company, if any.

OVERVIEW\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Versus Systems Inc. (the “Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and\nmaintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability. Accordingly, in accordance with the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq Rules”),\nSection 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (“Rule 10D-1”), the Board has adopted this Policy (the “Policy”) to\nprovide for the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from Executive Officers. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have\nthe meanings set forth in Section H, below.\nB. RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\n(1) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will reasonably promptly recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received in accordance with\nthe Nasdaq Rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows:\n(i) After an Accounting Restatement, the Compensation Committee (if composed entirely of independent directors, or in the absence of such a committee, a majority\nof independent directors serving on the Board) (the “Committee”) shall determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by each\nExecutive Officer and shall promptly notify each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a\ndemand for repayment or return of such compensation, as applicable.\n(a) For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement:\ni. The amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on\nthe Company’s stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation was Received; and\nii. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant documentation as required to\nNasdaq.\n(ii) The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the particular facts and\ncircumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Section B(2) below, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the\namount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer’s obligations hereunder.\n(iii)To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received under any duplicative\nrecovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\n(iv)To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company shall take all actions\nreasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The applicable Executive Officer shall be\nrequired to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Section B(1) above if the Committee\n(which, as specified above, is composed entirely of independent directors or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board)\ndetermines that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following three (3) conditions are met:\n(i) The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before\nmaking this determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such attempt(s) and\nprovide such documentation to Nasdaq;\n(ii) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company has obtained an opinion of\nhome country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to Nasdaq; or\n(iii)Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet\nthe requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.\nC. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and rules, including\nwithout limitation, filing a copy of this Policy and any amendments thereto as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K or Form 20-F, as applicable.\nD. PROHIBITION OF INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid,\nreturned or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Company shall\nnot enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of this Policy or\nthat waives the Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on\nor after the Effective Date of this Policy).\n2 of 5\nE. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this\nPolicy and for the Company’s compliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq\npromulgated or issued in connection therewith.\nEach Executive Officer, upon being so designated or assuming such position, is required to execute and deliver a written acknowledgement of and agreement to abide\nby the Policy substantially in the form annexed hereto, provided that the failure to provide such notice or obtain such acknowledgement or agreement shall have no impact on\nthe applicability or enforceability of the Policy.\nF. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section F\nto the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the\nCompany contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule or Nasdaq rule.\nG. OTHER RECOVERY RIGHTS\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable law or guidance from the SEC or Nasdaq, their\nbeneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. The Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable\nlaw. Any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or any other agreement or arrangement with an Executive Officer shall be deemed to include, as\na condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by the Executive Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to the terms of\nany policy of the Company or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement or other arrangement.\nH.
