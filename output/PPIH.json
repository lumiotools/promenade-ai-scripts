(NASDAQ: PPIH) announced today financial results for the second quarter and fiscal year-to-date period ended July 31, 2024. \n\n\"Net sales for the second quarter were $37.5 million, an increase of $2.4 million, as compared to the same quarter last year. Net income attributable to common stock of $3.3 million, was an increase of $2.3 million, or 222%, compared to $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2023. For the six months ended July 31, 2024, net sales of $71.8 million represents an increase of 11%, compared to the six months ended July 31, 2023. After considering the non-controlling interest, the resulting net income attributable to common stock of $4.7 million, was an increase of $4.8 million, compared to a net loss of $(0.1) million in the six months ended July 31, 2023. This was the result of increased sales volumes and better margin performance,” noted President and CEO David Mansfield. \n\n“Backlog in the second quarter saw considerable growth and now stands at $75.5 million. This represents a 10% increase from the backlog at January 31, 2024. It should be noted that this backlog of $75.5 million excludes more than $46 million of additional awards that were secured subsequent to the end of the quarter relating to two projects in the MENA region, as announced in a press release issued on August 23, 2024. The aggregate amount of backlog at the end of the second quarter plus the two additional project awards is very encouraging,” Mr. Mansfield continued. \n\n“Our second quarter and fiscal 2024 year-to-date results continue to reflect exemplary performance on behalf of the organization and continual growth in business activity in various markets. The growth we are experiencing now further demonstrates a strengthening of demand for our services. It is also worth noting that our net income attributable to common stock for the six months ended July 31, 2024, represents the highest level of earnings on a year-to-date basis since transitioning from MFRI to Perma-Pipe, which occurred in March 2017,” said Mr. Mansfield. \n\n“We are pleased with the level of business activity we are experiencing in various markets as a result of increases in infrastructure spending, primarily attributable to Saudi Arabia, India, and the U.A.E. These are key drivers of our overall improvement in net sales and margins in the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis and for which we are encouraged by the strength of our financial results as it enables us to continue to execute on strategic initiatives,” concluded Mr. Mansfield. \n\n**Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales were $37.5 million and $35.1 million in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $2.4 million, or 7%, was a result of increased sales volumes. \n\nGross profit was $13.5 million, or 36% of net sales, and $9.5 million, or 27% of net sales, in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $4.0 million, was primarily driven by increased sales volumes and better margins due to product mix. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.0 million and $5.3 million in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $0.7 million, was due to higher payroll expenses and professional service fees in the quarter. \n\nSelling expenses remained consistent and were $1.4 million and $1.5 million in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nNet interest expense remained consistent and was $0.5 million and $0.6 million in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nOther income was consistent and less than $0.1 million in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nThe Company's ETR was 23% and 45% in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the ETR is due to the ability to recognize tax benefits on losses in the United States in the current year whereas the prior year had a full valuation allowance and changes in the mix of income and loss in various jurisdictions. \n\nNet income attributable to common stock was $3.3 million and $1.0 million in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $2.3 million was mainly due to increased sales activity and better margin performance in the quarter. \n\n**Fiscal 2024 Year-to-Date Results**\n\nNet sales were $71.8 million and $64.8 million in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $7.0 million, or 11%, was a result of increased sales volumes. \n\nGross profit was $24.0 million, or 33% of net sales, and $16.2 million, or 25% of net sales, in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $7.8 million, was primarily driven by increased sales volumes and better margins due to product mix. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $12.1 million and $10.7 million in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $1.4 million, was due to higher payroll expenses and professional service fees. \n\nSelling expenses remained consistent and were $2.6 million and $2.7 million in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nNet interest expense remained consistent and was $1.0 million and $1.1 million in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nOther (expense) income resulted in expense of $(0.1) million and income of $0.2 million in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in foreign currency transactions. \n\nThe Company's ETR was 25% and 97% in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the ETR is due to the ability to recognize tax benefits on losses in the United States in the current year whereas the prior year had a full valuation allowance and changes in the mix of income and loss in various jurisdictions. \n\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stock was $4.7 million and $(0.1) million in the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $4.8 million was mainly due to increased sales activity and better margin performance. \n\n**Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc.**\n\nPerma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc.
