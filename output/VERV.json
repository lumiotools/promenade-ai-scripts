VERVE-102 has been well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events and no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities observed. We look forward to providing initial data from the Heart-2 clinical trial and an update on the PCSK9 program in the first half of 2025.”\n\nDr. Kathiresan continued, “In addition, we are excited to announce that the first participant in the Pulse-1 Phase 1b clinical trial for our ANGPTL3 product candidate, VERVE-201, was recently dosed. With cash runway through 2026, we are well-positioned to execute additional important milestones across our pipeline and advance our early-stage programs, including our program targeting LPA. With two product candidates being tested in the clinic, we expect 2025 to be an eventful year for Verve as we develop a new approach for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.”\n\n**PCSK9 Program** _Enrollment Ongoing in Heart-2 Phase 1b Clinical Trial Evaluating VERVE-102_\n\n  * VERVE-102 is a novel, investigational gene editing medicine designed to be a single course treatment that permanently turns off the  _PCSK9_ gene in the liver and durably reduces disease-driving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). VERVE-102 consists of messenger RNA expressing an adenine base editor and an optimized guide RNA targeting the  _PCSK9_ gene identical to VERVE-101, the company’s initial PCSK9 product candidate that showed proof-of concept for this mechanism. However, compared to VERVE-101, VERVE-102 uses a different lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system, which includes a different ionizable lipid and Verve’s proprietary GalNAc liver-targeting ligand, designed to allow the LNP to access liver cells using either the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) or the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR).\n\n\n  * VERVE-102 is being evaluated in the Heart-2 open-label Phase 1b clinical trial in two patient populations who require deep and durable reductions of LDL-C levels in the blood: adults living with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and adults living with premature coronary artery disease (CAD). The Heart-2 clinical trial is expected to include four dose cohorts, each comprised of three to nine patients with either HeFH or premature CAD.\n\n\n  * As of October 29, 2024, dosing has been completed in seven participants in the first two dose cohorts, 0.3 mg/kg and 0.45 mg/kg, in the Heart-2 clinical trial. VERVE-102 has been well-tolerated. No serious adverse events and no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities have been observed. Following the standard review from the independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB), the company expects to continue the dose escalation portion of the clinical trial.\n\n\n  * Verve recently received clearance of its Clinical Trial Applications (CTAs) for the Heart-2 clinical trial in Israel and New Zealand. Enrollment remains ongoing in Australia, Canada, and the U.K.\n\n\n  * In November 2024, Verve plans to present a moderated digital poster at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions describing the design of the Heart-2 Phase 1b clinical trial.\n\n\n  * Verve expects to provide initial data from the Heart-2 clinical trial and an update on the PCSK9 program in the first half of 2025. The company also plans to initiate the Phase 2 clinical trial for the PCSK9 program in the second half of 2025.\n\n\n\n_Analyses of Heart-1 Phase 1b Clinical Trial of VERVE-101_\n\n  * Verve recently reported updated durability data from the Heart-1 clinical trial of VERVE-101 at the [European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 2024 Congress](https://live-verve-therapeutics.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/2024-10/Khera_ESGCT%202024%20FINAL_0.pdf) and the [American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2024 Meeting](https://www.vervetx.com/sites/default/files/2024-10/Kathiresan_ASNKidneyWeek_10252024%20FINAL.pdf). Mean, time-averaged PCSK9 protein reductions of greater than 60% were observed in each of the two higher dose cohorts (0.45 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg), and mean, time-averaged LDL-C reductions of 42% at 0.45 mg/kg (n=6) and time-averaged LDL-C reduction of 57% at 0.6 mg/kg (n=1) were observed. In the single participant in the highest dose cohort, LDL-C reduction has now been sustained out to 18 months after the single dose. No new treatment related adverse events have been reported since March 2024. Verve believes that these new durability data further support the potential of once-and-done gene editing medicines for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n  * Verve has completed a series of nonclinical studies as part of its investigation into the previously disclosed laboratory abnormalities observed with VERVE-101. In order to isolate the role of the LNP and determine whether the laboratory abnormalities observed in the Heart-1 clinical trial were due to the LNP delivery system, these studies used a version of VERVE-101 with a non-targeting guide RNA designed to preclude base editing. Data from these studies continue to support Verve’s understanding that the LNP in VERVE-101 is likely the primary driver of the laboratory abnormalities observed in the Heart-1 clinical trial. The Heart-1 clinical trial will remain paused during the dose escalation portion of the Heart-2 clinical trial evaluating VERVE-102.\n\n\n\n**ANGPTL3 Program** _First Participant Dosed with VERVE-201 in the Pulse-1 Phase 1b Clinical Trial_\n\n  * VERVE-201 is a novel, investigational gene editing medicine designed to be a single course treatment that permanently turns off the _ANGPTL3_ gene in the liver to reduce disease-driving LDL-C as well as remnant cholesterol and utilizes Verve’s proprietary GalNAc-LNP delivery technology. VERVE-201 is being developed in two patient populations: patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia (RH), defined as those who are unable to achieve adequate LDL-C reduction with maximally tolerated standard of care therapies, potentially including PCSK9 inhibitors, and patients living with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a rare and often fatal inherited cause of premature ASCVD characterized by extremely high blood LDL-C. The aim of this medicine is to reduce the heavy treatment burden associated with available therapies, including the requirement for multiple oral, injectable, and intravenous infusions, often administered over decades.\n\n\n  * Verve announced today that the first participant has been dosed with VERVE-201 in its Pulse-1 Phase 1b clinical trial.The Pulse-1 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VERVE-201 administration in adult patients with RH who require additional lowering of LDL-C despite treatment with maximally tolerated standard of care therapies, potentially including PCSK9 inhibitors. Endpoints also include pharmacokinetics and changes in blood ANGPTL3 protein and LDL-C levels. The Pulse-1 clinical trial is a single-ascending dose study that has an adaptive design. The Pulse-1 clinical trial is expected to include four dose cohorts each comprised of three to nine patients with RH.\n\n\n  * Verve recently received regulatory clearances to initiate the Pulse-1 clinical trial in Australia, Canada, and the U.K.\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Investor Events** Verve plans to participate in fireside chats during the following upcoming investor events:\n\n  * Guggenheim's Inaugural Healthcare Innovation Conference, November 11 at 4:00 PM ET, Boston, MA\n  * Stifel 2024 Healthcare Conference, November 18 at 3:00 PM ET, New York, NY\n  * Jefferies London Healthcare Conference, November 20 at 4:00 PM GMT, London, UK\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Medical Meeting Presentations** Verve plans to present a moderated digital poster at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in Chicago, IL. Details of the poster session are as follows:\n\n**Title:** Design of Heart-2: a phase 1b clinical trial of VERVE-102, an _in vivo_ base editing medicine delivered by a GalNAc-LNP and targeting _PCSK9_ to durably lower LDL cholesterol**Session:** Genomic Therapies for Cardiovascular Disease**Date and Time:** November 16 at 10:35 AM CT\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash Position:** Verve ended the third quarter of 2024 with $539.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

The options have an exercise price of $5.73 per share, which is equal to the closing price of the company’s common stock on the date of grant. Each option has a 10-year term and will vest over a period of four years, with 25% of the shares vesting on the one-year anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments over the following three years, subject to each such employee’s continued service with the company on each such vesting date. The RSUs will vest in equal annual installments on the first four anniversaries of January 1, 2025, subject to each such employee’s continued service with the company on each such vesting date.\n\n**About Verve Therapeutics** Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: VERV) is a clinical-stage company developing a new class of genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease with the potential to transform treatment from chronic management to single-course gene editing medicines. The company’s lead programs – VERVE-101, VERVE-102, and VERVE-201 – target genes that have been extensively validated as targets for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a root cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). VERVE-101 and VERVE-102 are designed to permanently turn off the _PCSK9_ gene in the liver and are being developed initially for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and ultimately to treat patients with established ASCVD who continue to be impacted by high LDL-C levels. VERVE-201 is designed to permanently turn off the _ANGPTL3_ gene in the liver and is initially being developed for refractory hypercholesterolemia, where patients still have high LDL-C despite treatment with maximally tolerated standard of care therapies, and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).
