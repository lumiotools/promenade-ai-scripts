The auction is a unique blend of sophisticated technology and human judgment that produces the day's most important price point for investors and listed companies. The smooth functioning of auctions is critical as market participants expect and rely on the close to provide a critical daily price point that reflects market interest.\n\nGiven the auction's importance, the NYSE places intense focus on its technology and process, and strives to ensure that all participants understand the tools available to facilitate trading in this critical event.\n\n### Here's a behind-the-scenes look at what happen during the NYSE Closing Auction.\n\n### Key Points\n\n  * Given the auction’s importance, the NYSE places intense focus on its technology and process to facilitate trading in this critical event\n  * NYSE is the only exchange with an open-outcry trading floor, able to offer investors access to auctions via a Floor Broker\n  * The NYSE closing auction grew to nearly 7% of NYSE-listed volume, roughly twice the share that auction commanded just five years ago\n\n\n\n  *   * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=&text= \"Share on Twitter\")\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u= \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=&summary= \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n\n\n\n## Auction Participants\n\nInvestors seeking to participate in the closing auction can participate in the same way they participate in trading throughout the day, by sending orders to their broker to act on their behalf to execute their orders. Investors can also direct their orders to a NYSE Floor Broker for execution in the close, just as they can at any point throughout the trading day. Floor Brokers can receive orders from their customers via voice or electronic communication, and enter their order via handheld device or using algorithms.\n\nSee our [related post](/equities-insights#20190715) on D Orders for data and analysis of Closing D Order usage\n\nDesignated Market Makers (DMMs) have obligations to maintain fair and orderly markets and facilitate price discovery throughout the trading day, obligations that extend to the auctions. One of their obligations is to facilitate the closing auction process, which includes setting the closing price at a level that satisfies all interest that is willing to participate at a price better than the closing auction price, and supplying liquidity as needed to offset any remaining auction imbalances that exist at the closing bell.\n\n## Order Types\n\nThere are several NYSE order types that can be used in the closing auction, with the most common being Market-On-Close (MOC) and Limit-On-Close (LOC) orders.\n\nAn MOC order is an unpriced order to buy or sell a security at the closing price and is guaranteed to receive an execution in the NYSE closing auction. An LOC order sets the maximum price an investor is willing to pay, or the minimum price for which an investor is willing to sell, in the closing auction. An LOC order priced better than the final closing auction price is guaranteed to receive an execution in the NYSE closing auction.\n\nBecause the NYSE is the only exchange with an open-outcry Trading Floor, it is also able to offer investors access to auctions via a Floor Broker. Floor Brokers are able to enter a customer's order orally to a DMM on the NYSE Trading Floor or via an electronic order, called a Closing D Order, which again is sent from the NYSE Trading Floor. Closing D Order are designed to replicate the Floor Broker's traditional face-to-face interaction, participating passively most of the day but also trading at more aggressive prices when contra-side liquidity is available.\n\nThe various order types described above are designed to allow maximum flexibility for investors choosing to participate in the auction. The different order types align with different events leading up to the auction.\n\n### Closing Auction Timeline\n\n6:30 AM | MOC/LOC orders can be entered  \n---|---  \n2:00 PM | Imbalance information is published to Floor Brokers  \n3:50 PM |  Cutoff for MOC and LOC order entry, modification, and cancellation Imbalance dissemination begins including Closing D Orders at their discretionary price range   \n3:59:50 PM | Cutoff for Closing D Order entry, modification and cancellation  \n4:00 PM | Regular way trading ends and auction commences  \n  \n### Auction Transparency\n\nBeginning at 3:50 p.m., NYSE publicly disseminates closing auction order imbalance information. At 3:55 p.m., the NYSE includes Closing D Orders at their discretionary price range in the closing auction order imbalance information. This provides the market with information about the level of buyers and sellers in a particular security, and aims to give investors the opportunity to decide whether to participate in the last trade of the day. The information is published every five seconds (if the information changes) until 4.00 pm. Key data points include: \n\nImbalance Side | Buy/sell direction of imbalance shares  \n---|---  \nReference Price |  Used to calculate Continuous Book Clearing Price (generally last sale)   \nPaired Quantity | Number of shares matched at the Reference Price  \nContinuous Book Clearing Price |  Price where all better-priced orders on the side of the imbalance could be traded   \n  \n### The Auction in Action: Bringing more buyers and sellers together\n\nThe growth in passive investing, along with the challenges of trading in a market with many exchanges and dark pools, has helped the NYSE closing auction grow to nearly 7% of NYSE-listed volume. This is roughly twice the share that auction commanded just five years ago. This is the case because investors and brokers acting on their behalf can see the benefit of participating at a time when the maximum amount of buyers and sellers are coming together. \n\n## Resources\n\n[Article Why NYSE's Closing Auction is crucial for modern marketsTwenty years ago, trading shares in a company was a simple business.

We’ve created the world’s largest and most trusted equities exchange, the leading ETF exchange and the world’s most deterministic trading technology. Our data, technology and expertise help today’s leaders and tomorrow’s visionaries capitalize on opportunity in the public markets.\n\nAbout the NYSE\n\n[The NYSE Bell](/bell)\n\n![Buttonwood agreement](/publicdocs/images/buttonwood_agreement_for_NYSE_History.jpeg)\n\nThe original Buttonwood Agreement signed on May 17, 1792.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange traces its origins to the Buttonwood Agreement signed by 24 stockbrokers on May 17, 1792, as a response to the first financial panic in the young nation. It set rules for how stocks could be traded and established set commissions. The [Agreement ](#buttonwoodvideo) aimed to promote public confidence in the markets and to ensure that deals were conducted between trusted parties. \n\nThough the Buttonwood Agreement marks the official founding of the NYSE, the Exchange traces its roots back to the 1600s and the foundation of the U.S. Capital Markets. In 1624, the Dutch founded New Amsterdam on the southern end of Manhattan and built a stockade from which the street derives its name; running east from what is now Broadway downhill to the East River. The Compromise of 1790 cemented Wall Street’s role as the nation’s financial capital. The agreement allowed Alexander Hamilton, the United States first Secretary of the Treasury, to implement his fiscal policy of paying Revolutionary War debt using federally issued bonds. Hamilton’s economic and financial vision included federal assumption of the debt from the Revolutionary War, creation of a central bank, and support for indigenous manufacturing. Together, these laid the framework for a strong economy that unleashed free enterprise, entrepreneurship and credit that enabled markets and private institutions like the NYSE to flourish. \n\n![NYSE in 1868 on broad street](/publicdocs/images/1868_broad_street_NYSE.jpeg)\n\nIn the Exchange’s early years, stock trading continued on an informal basis in nearby coffeehouses where merchants typically gathered. By 1817, the stock market was active enough to encourage the brokers to create a formal organization. A constitution was adopted on March 8, 1817, creating the New York Stock & Exchange Board, the forerunner of today’s NYSE. From the beginning, regulations governed trading. The constitution spelt out detailed rules for the transaction of business and imposed fines to keep disorderly brokers in check. The new stock exchange rented a room at 40 Wall Street where the brokers gathered twice a day to trade a list of 30 stocks and bonds. From the podium the president called out the name of each security in turn, while the brokers shouted bids and offers from the chairs assigned to them. This was the origin of the term “seat” which, ever since, has signified a membership on the NYSE. \n\nThe number and variety of securities traded at the NYSE steadily increased as America grew. States and municipalities issued bonds to finance the construction of turnpikes, canals, and bridges. Banks, insurance companies and railroads issued stock to raise the necessary capital to develop and expand. By the end of the Civil War, more than 300 different stocks and bonds were traded at the NYSE. The Exchange moved into its first permanent home – on a portion of its present Broad Street site – in 1865. \n\nJust a few years later, increasing trading volumes inspired the NYSE to switch from the old method of trading to a new system of simultaneous trading in all stocks in a continuous market. Stocks were assigned to specific locations – trading posts – and brokers abandoned their seats to roam about the large open trading floor to trade directly with one another in whatever stock they chose. \n\n![Annunciator Board at the NYSE](/publicdocs/images/1881_annuciator_board.jpeg)\n\nNYSE Trading Floor, 1881 with annuciator board pictured left.\n\nThe introduction of the stock ticker in 1867 revolutionized market communications by making it possible to quickly transmit market information across the United States, significantly narrowing the gap between Wall Street and Main Street. When telephones were installed at the NYSE in 1878, the market became even more efficient, and on December 15, 1886, trading volume topped 1 million shares for the first time. \n\nOne of the most familiar images of the NYSE, the loud ringing of a bell signaling the opening or closing of the day’s trading, was first used at the Exchange in the 1870s with the advent of continuous trading. Critical to ensuring orderly functioning of the marketplace, the [original bell ](/bell/history) of choice was a Chinese gong. \n\nAs the stock market continued to grow, the NYSE in 1903 moved into a new building with a much larger Trading Floor, designed by George B. Post. Post designed an impressive interior space, with paneled Georgian marble walls, huge windows and a gilded ceiling that stands four stories above traders’ heads. The statuary pediment titled, “Integrity Protecting the Works of Man” was designed by the eminent sculptor, John Quincy Adams Ward. Today, the NYSE building is one of the most exclusive and sought-after [event spaces](/nyse-events) in New York City, poised at the center of global financial markets. \n\n![NYSE trading floor in 1903](/publicdocs/images/1903_trading_floor_NYSE.jpeg)\n\nNYSE facade in 1903.\n\nWhen the current NYSE building opened in 1903, the gong was replaced by a brass bell — electrically operated and large enough to resonate throughout the voluminous main trading floor. Today, each of the four trading areas of the NYSE has its own bell, operated synchronously from a single control panel. \n\nModulating the temperature of the open-air space stretching nearly 100 feet above the Trading Floor required the services of engineer Alfred Wolff. Wolff designed and installed three ammonia-absorption machines, each with a cooling capability equivalent to one hundred and fifty tons of ice. This industrial feat made the NYSE the first air-conditioned building in North America. In addition, the room had some of the newest trading technologies including modern tickers, telephones, and a pneumatic tube system to send orders and market data throughout the building. \n\nTrading Floor and office space were expanded further in 1922 with construction of the 11 Wall Street addition. The trading posts, dotted through the center of the room began as simple signposts, but expanded over time. The NYSE also held its inaugural [Christmas Tree Lighting](/event/annual-tree-lighting), a Wall Street community event that has been celebrated annually, since 1923. In 1928, the Quotation Department was developed to provide the most recent stock quotations to member firms. Uniformed clerks wearing headsets were in continuous contact with the trading floor and posted the current bid and asked quotes on the board above the seated telephone operators. Around 35,000 stock quotations were furnished daily in 1931. An automated quotation system replaced the department in 1960. \n\n![Stock Market Crash](/publicdocs/images/1929_nyse_stock_market.jpeg)\n\n1929 Stock market \"crash.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, October 24, 1929, the market “crashed.” Prices plummeted as brokers sold their customers’ stocks to cover losses when investors could not meet the calls for more margin. Over 16,000,000 shares were traded, a record which would not be surpassed for 39 years. The crash focused attention on the securities industry and led to several important reforms. To supplement the NYSE’s own self-regulatory activities, the U.S. Congress in 1934 created the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate operation of the nation’s securities markets. \n\nIn the 1930s, new trading posts were installed that allowed market makers to stand outside the posts and coordinate the trading of multiple stocks at each location. Initially, a group of clerks, tube men and runners would work inside the horseshoe transmitting orders and recording stock quotes and sales.\n\nThe market languished during World War II and encouraged investing in victory through the purchase of bonds via the war loan of the United States. Due to a shortage of male employees, women worked as pages and reporters on the trading floor for the first time in the Exchange’s history. The market recovered its vitality in the post-war years. The NYSE’s educational efforts to acquaint potential investors with the long-term benefits of owning “Your share of American business” broadened stock ownership considerably during the 1950s and 1960s. \n\nAlthough the appearance of the Trading Floor seemed unchanged from the 1930s, automation systems installed in other parts of the building began to assist traders during the 1950s. The introduction of technology over the next decade enabled the rate of trading to increase substantially from just over a billion shares traded during 1960 to over three billion in 1970. The first computers made by IBM (NYSE: IBM) were installed at the NYSE. During the 1960s, computer data processing technologies were first applied to the NYSE’s market operations. Electronic capture of trading data and dissemination of market information via high-speed data networks greatly increased market efficiency. In the following decade, the NYSE launched its SuperDot system which electronically delivered an order from the broker’s office directly to the NYSE trading post and then sent an execution report back within seconds.\n\n![Muriel Sibert 1967](/publicdocs/images/1967_siebert_muriel.jpeg)\n\nThe first permenant female member, Muriel Sibert in 1967.\n\nThe technological advancements of the Trading Floor from the 1960s-1970s were met by its diversification. The first permanent female member, Muriel Siebert, was inaugurated on December 28, 1967. Siebert’s entry to the Floor was followed by the first Black member, Joseph L. Searles III, on February 12, 1970. The next year, Daniels & Bell Inc., followed by Russell L. Goings, Jr.’s First Harlem Securities, became the first Black member firms. In 1973, Ambassador Harold Doley became the first Black member to self-fund the purchase of his seat before founding one of the Exchange’s longest-lived independent Black member firms. Later in the decade, Alice Jarcho became the first full-time female floor broker in 1976, and in 1985, Gail Pankey became the first Black female member of the NYSE.\n\nIn the 1970s, computer display monitors showing current market data were added atop the old trading posts in a transitional program to modernize trading floor technology. The floor underwent its first major renovation in five decades starting in 1979 to incorporate the latest technologies to the trading posts. The space frame that is still visible was added above the floor, distributed power, data cables as well as air conditioning and supported the trading post superstructure.\n\nConstruction on the New York Futures Exchange Trading Floor also began in 1979. NYSE Futures became the most modern futures trading environment of its time. Simulated trading sessions were conducted before the opening of the New York Futures Exchange in Spring 1980. At the time of its opening, the New York Futures Exchange had 1,569 members, making it the largest membership of any financial future exchange in the nation. \n\nOther milestones include February 8, 1980, when market capitalization of NYSE-listed topped $1 trillion. On October 19, 1987, “Black Monday,” the market had one of its most dramatic falls in history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508 points, losing a record 22 percent of its value, on a volume of 604 million shares. In the following months, the NYSE introduced nearly 30 changes aimed at dampening price volatility, streamlining procedures, and bolstering the capacity of NYSE electronic systems to handle sustained trading in hundreds of millions of shares. \n\n![Ronald Reagan visiting the NYSE in 1985.](/publicdocs/images/1985_ronald_reagan_NYSE_Floor.jpeg)\n\nRonald Reagan visiting the floor of the NYSE in 1985.\n\nTrading floor facilities were reengineered during the 1980s and 1990s to streamline market processes and keep ahead of the NYSE’s mounting trading volumes. The first handhelds were introduced on the Trading Floor in 1992. Technology improvements in 1995 included adding flat panel data display screens on the trading posts. This was the country’s first large-scale use of this new technology. By 1996, the Epson Handheld Computer allowed brokers to access the NYSE Wireless Data System that was introduced. This emerging technology allowed increased volume leading to the first one billion share day on October 28, 1997. \n\nIn 2005, NYSE Hybrid Market was launched, creating a unique blend of floor-based auction and electronic trading, a “high tech, high touch” model. Major advances occurred in market data display and handheld technology, leading to the elimination of the open outcry system on the floor, in 2006, when the NYSE merged with Arca, short for Archipelago Exchange, the first all-electronic exchange in the U.S. on which stocks and options are traded. \n\nIn the early 2000s, changes occurred across the NYSE. On November 16, 2005, Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE) listed on the NYSE. In 2006, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Archipelago (Arca), and the Pacific Exchange (PCX) merged to form the publicly traded NYSE Group, ending membership ownership of the Exchange. In 2008, the NYSE acquired the American Stock Exchange, becoming the third largest U.S. options market. By 2013, [ICE acquired the NYSE ](#icevideo) and remains the parent organization of the Exchange today. \n\n![ICE listing on NYSE in 2005](/publicdocs/images/nyse_ice_listed_2005.jpeg)\n\nICE listing on NYSE in 2005.\n\nThe current floor began to take shape in 2011 with the addition of new broker booths that offer enhanced functionality to floor broker firms and new trading posts that feature high-definition data display screens and the most current workstations. A host of new systems, such as the electronic Specialist Display Book, Broker Booth Support System (BBSS), and wireless e-Broker System, provide powerful tools to the NYSE broker. \n\nIn 2016, Phase 1 Pillar, a new integrated trading technology platform to enable member firms to connect to all NYSE equities and options markets using a standard protocol and improve efficiency and reduce complexity for customers, while enhancing consistency, performance, and resiliency, was completed. By 2019, the NYSE marked the successful migration of its trading technology to NYSE Pillar. To date, NYSE, NYSE American Equities, NYSE Arca Equities, NYSE Chicago, and NYSE National have been migrated to NYSE Pillar matching engines, and NYSE Pillar Gateways are available for order entry on each market. \n\nIn 2018, Stacey Cunningham became the first woman to lead the NYSE when she was named the Exchange’s67th President. In 2021, Tigress Financial Partners became the Exchange’s first disabled and female-owned pit brokers in the marketplace, founded by CEO Cynthia DiBartolo. This was followed by the naming of the second female and 68th President, Lynn Martin \n\nThe NYSE’s technological advancements proved invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 23, 2020, for the first time in its history, the NYSE operated without a Trading Floor following the closure and shift to full electronic trading due to COVID-19. While electronic trading remained uninterrupted, data showed operating with the Trading Floor provides investors the highest level of market quality. The Floor partially reopened on May 26, 2020. Other volatile moments in the Exchange’s history include September 11, 2001. The re-opening of the markets on 9/17 following the [9/11 terrorist attacks](#911video) represented the resilience and importance of the New York Stock Exchange as the heart of the global capital markets. \n\n![The NYSE Facade](/publicdocs/images/NYSE_Facade_900x706_2023.jpg)\n\nThe NYSE Facade\n"

They are critical to the orderly functioning of the marketplace, assuring that no trades take place before the opening or after the close.\n\n[Bell Calendar](/bell/calendar)\n\n[Recent Bell Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8VyXhTFhI7CD3ZwcaSBebIHpVmSd3UXT)\n\n# The History of the Bell\n\n**First Uses of the Bell**\n\nBells were first used at the Exchange in the 1870s with the advent of continuous trading. A Chinese gong was the original bell of choice. But in 1903, when the Exchange moved to its current building, the gong was replaced by a brass bell -- electrically operated and large enough in size to resonate throughout the voluminous main trading floor. Today, each of the four trading areas of the NYSE has its own bell, operated synchronously from a single control panel. \n\nThe brass bells functioned without incident until the late 1980s, when the NYSE decided the time had come to refurbish them and purchase a new one for backup. With that decision, the Exchange learned just how unusual its bells really are. \n\nFirst, the Exchange had to identify the manufacturer of the bells -- a firm with which the NYSE hadn’t done business in more than 80 years. With some digging, the G. S. Edwards Company of Norwalk, Connecticut, was rediscovered. \n\nHowever, when the NYSE officials explained that they wanted to purchase a new bell, measuring 18 inches in diameter and matching the old, representatives of the Edwards Company were astonished. It seems that neither Edwards nor any other company, makes bells anywhere near that large -- or loud -- today. \n\nEdwards agreed to make a new bell from scratch, bringing former employees out of retirement to handle the job. Sound measurements were taken, and the tone of the bell was matched to the NYSE’s existing bells. \n\n**A Hidden Discovery**\n\nAlong the way, too, came the discovery of a massive old bell hidden within the infrastructure of the NYSE. An electrical contractor, on hearing of the plans to upgrade the bell system, recalled how he had once seen a bell in the crawl space above the ceiling of the main trading room. The long-forgotten beauty -- a whopping 27 inches in diameter and covered with a thick coat of dust -- was removed and reconditioned. It turned out to be another 1903 original and is believed to have been buried in its resting place for half a century because it was simply too loud even for the Exchange. Toned down, it now gleams on a platform above the trading floor, patiently awaiting its recall to duty if the need ever arises. \n\nWhen the NYSE moved into its new building at 10-12 Broad Street in 1865, “calls” of stock were made twice a day in the second floor Board Room. The president kept order during trading sessions with the aid of a gavel. \n\n![](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/images/NYSE-CB-Photo-20200320-Press-4.png)\n\nThe gavel has always been used in conjunction with the closing bell, perhaps in recognition of the 19th century stock calls. The gavel strikes a \"sounding block,\" a turned block of wood, possibly oak, from the center part of a log (you can see tree rings on the bottom side). This sounding block, or one of a similar size and shape, appears in the 1928 motion picture film, \"The Nation's Marketplace.\" \n\n**Some additional bell facts:**\n\n  * The first guest to ring the opening bell was Leonard Ross, in 1956 . The 10-year-old had won a television quiz show answering questions about the stock market. \n  * An expert analyzed the sound of the bell for the NYSE’s trademark registration as follows: \"The mark consists of the sound of a brass bell tuned to the pitch D, but with an overtone of D-sharp, struck nine times at a brisk tempo, with the final tone allowed to ring until the sound decays naturally. The rhythmic pattern is eight 16th notes and a quarter note; the total duration, from the striking of the first tone to the end of the decay on the final one, is just over 3 seconds.\" \n\n\n"
