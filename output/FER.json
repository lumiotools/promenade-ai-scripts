This is a True/False flag set by the cookie.  \n_hjCachedUserAttributes| Session| This cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample. These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.  \n_hjClosedSurveyInvites| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor interacts with an External Link Survey invitation modal. It is used to ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.  \n_hjDonePolls| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget. It is used to ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already been filled in.  \n_hjid| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.  \n_hjIncludedInPageviewSample| 30 minutes| This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the data sampling defined by your site's pageview limit.  \n_hjIncludedInSessionSample| 30 minutes| This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the data sampling defined by your site's daily session limit  \n_hjLocalStorageTest| Less than 100ms| This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage.

This is done so that the Incoming Feedback will load as minimized immediately if the visitor navigates to another page where it is set to show.  \n_hjTLDTest| Session| When the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After this check, the cookie is removed.  \n_hjUserAttributesHash| Session| User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.  \n_smvs| 23 hours 59 minutes| Records visitor behavior data on the web.

After this check, the cookie is removed.  \n_hjUserAttributesHash| Session| User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.  \n_smvs| 23 hours 59 minutes| Records visitor behavior data on the web.

The Track systems contracts to be awarded to Ferrovial BAM are part of a wider set of rail systems contracts announced by HS2 Ltd in November worth a combined total of around £3bn. The exact value of the work to be delivered by Ferrovial BAM will be confirmed once contracts are signed. This latest award adds to the portfolio of critical infrastructure projects that Ferrovial and BAM have partnered on over the last 14 years.\n\nThis is the largest scheme that Ferrovial’s UK Construction business has secured in the UK since being active in the market over 20 years ago.\n\nThrough the joint venture, Ferrovial and BAM, will deliver three sections between Old Oak Common and Birmingham Curzon Street station, totalling 140 miles of the high-speed route. The contract includes the design and installation of approximately 280 miles of track capable of speeds up to 225mph (360km/h). The joint venture will also act as the principal contractor for track-related works, overseeing logistics and supporting the testing and commissioning phase.\n\nHS2 confirmed this project award last week (26 Nov ‘24), along with contracts awarded to other contractors for Overhead Catenary Systems (OCS), Operational Telecommunications and Security Systems, Third Party Telecommunications, Command, Control, Signalling and Traffic Management (CCS&TM), and Engineering Management System.\n\nOverall, these contracts are valued at approximately £3 billion and are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs across the UK. The initial design phase will run concurrently with the completion of main works contracts, which are now at their peak. This ensures that the team is ready to mobilize as soon as the civil works are complete.\n\nThe statutory 10-day standstill period has now ended and contracts will now be signed, marking the beginning of a new phase for HS2 and for UK high-speed rail.\n\nThe Ferrovial BAM team have a successful history of delivering critical infrastructure for the UK on time and to budget together in joint venture partnership. First working together in 2010 as BFK to deliver 3 Crossrail contracts including the longest stretch of tunnelling works between Royal Oak and Farringdon, as well as Farringdon Station itself, the first central station to be completed on the Elizabeth Line. The team is also delivering the Silvertown Tunnel project together in East London and has been delivering excellence at each stage of HS2, such as Fusion JV for the Enabling Works packages, EKFB for the central Main Works Contract and now delivering the track infrastructure across the entire HS2 trace.\n\nThe team will operate under a collaborative Rail Systems Alliance structure, designed to manage interfaces and resolve any program conflicts. The members will work together on design, access, resources, and logistics to achieve shared goals for cost and schedule.\n\nTo date, Ferrovial’s Construction business unit has delivered 1,125km of high-speed rail in Spain, the USA, and the UK. In Spain, the company has built 12% of the High-Speed Rail Network, delivered 26% of the railway network’s track, and maintains over 45% of the Spanish high-speed network, the second longest in the world. The company owns 26 patented technologies for innovations in track assembly.\n\n[ ](#)\n\n[ Vídeo  ](#)\n\n## Related content\n\n[\n\n  * Press releases\n\nFerrovial closes the sale of a 19.75% stake

The cookie is used to store information of how visitors use a website and helps in creating an analytics report of how the wbsite is doing. The data collected including the number visitors, the source where they have come from, and the pages viisted in an anonymous form.  \n_hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress| 30 minutes| This cookie is used to detect the first pageview session of a user. This is a True/False flag set by the cookie.  \n_hjCachedUserAttributes| Session| This cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample. These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.  \n_hjClosedSurveyInvites| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor interacts with an External Link Survey invitation modal. It is used to ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.  \n_hjDonePolls| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget. It is used to ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already been filled in.  \n_hjid| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.  \n_hjIncludedInPageviewSample| 30 minutes| This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the data sampling defined by your site's pageview limit.  \n_hjIncludedInSessionSample| 30 minutes| This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the data sampling defined by your site's daily session limit  \n_hjLocalStorageTest| Less than 100ms| This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage.

The data stored in_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost immediately after it is created.  \n_hjMinimizedPolls| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor minimizes an On-site Survey widget. It is used to ensure that the widget stays minimized when the visitor navigates through your site.  \n_hjRecordingLastActivity| Session| This should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies). This gets updated when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).  \n_hjShownFeedbackMessage| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set when a visitor minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback. This is done so that the Incoming Feedback will load as minimized immediately if the visitor navigates to another page where it is set to show.  \n_hjTLDTest| Session| When the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails.

As part of the agreement, Macquarie (Ferrovial’s joint venture partner in AGS) will also sell its entire stake (50%) in AGS.\n\nThe agreement values 100% of the stake at £900 million, representing the equity value for a 100% interest in AGS and is subject to certain closing adjustments and transaction costs. Net equity proceeds to Ferrovial will be determined at completion. This price represents an Enterprise Value (EV) estimated at £1.535 billion.\n\nCompletion of the disposal is subject to satisfaction of applicable regulatory approvals and is expected to close in Q1 2025. The estimated capital gain to be recognized by Ferrovial at completion is around 290 million euros.\n\n[ ](#)\n\n[ Vídeo  ](#)\n\n## Related content\n\n[\n\n  * Press releases\n\nFerrovial closes the

The cookie is used to store information of how visitors use a website and helps in creating an analytics report of how the wbsite is doing. The data collected including the number visitors, the source where they have come from, and the pages viisted in an anonymous form.  \n_hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress| 30 minutes| This cookie is used to detect the first pageview session of a user. This is a True/False flag set by the cookie.  \n_hjCachedUserAttributes| Session| This cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample. These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.  \n_hjClosedSurveyInvites| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor interacts with an External Link Survey invitation modal. It is used to ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.  \n_hjDonePolls| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget. It is used to ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already been filled in.  \n_hjid| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.  \n_hjIncludedInPageviewSample| 30 minutes| This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the data sampling defined by your site's pageview limit.  \n_hjIncludedInSessionSample| 30 minutes| This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the data sampling defined by your site's daily session limit  \n_hjLocalStorageTest| Less than 100ms| This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage.

This is done so that the Incoming Feedback will load as minimized immediately if the visitor navigates to another page where it is set to show.  \n_hjTLDTest| Session| When the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After this check, the cookie is removed.  \n_hjUserAttributesHash| Session| User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.  \n_smvs| 23 hours 59 minutes| Records visitor behavior data on the web.

These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.  \n_hjClosedSurveyInvites| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor interacts with an External Link Survey invitation modal. It is used to ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.  \n_hjDonePolls| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget. It is used to ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already been filled in.  \n_hjid| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.  \n_hjIncludedInPageviewSample| 30 minutes| This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the data sampling defined by your site's pageview limit.  \n_hjIncludedInSessionSample| 30 minutes| This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the data sampling defined by your site's daily session limit  \n_hjLocalStorageTest| Less than 100ms| This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage. If it can, a value of 1 is set in this cookie. The data stored in_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost immediately after it is created.  \n_hjMinimizedPolls| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set once a visitor minimizes an On-site Survey widget. It is used to ensure that the widget stays minimized when the visitor navigates through your site.  \n_hjRecordingLastActivity| Session| This should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies). This gets updated when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).  \n_hjShownFeedbackMessage| 365 days| Hotjar cookie that is set when a visitor minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback. This is done so that the Incoming Feedback will load as minimized immediately if the visitor navigates to another page where it is set to show.  \n_hjTLDTest| Session| When the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After this check, the cookie is removed.  \n_hjUserAttributesHash| Session| User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.  \n_smvs| 23 hours 59 minutes| Records visitor behavior data on the web. This is used for internal analysis and web optimization.  \n_uetsid| 1 day| This is a cookie used by Microsoft Bing Ads and it is a tracking cookie. Allows you to interact with a user who has already visited our website.   \n_uetvid| 2 weeks| Cookie installed by Google Tag Manager to store and track visits between sites.  \napbct_visible_fields| Session| Prevents spam content  \napbct_visible_fields_count| Session  \nct_checkjs| Session| Stores dynamic variables from the browser  \nct_fkp_timestamp| Session| Stores visit time  \nct_pointer_data| Session| Stores dynamic variables from the browser  \nct_ps_timestamp  \nct_timezone| Session| Stores visit time  \ndtCookie| Session  \nGPS| 30 minutes| This cookie is set by Youtube and registers a unique ID for tracking users based on their geographical location  \nlumesse_language| 50 years ago| This cookie determines language of Application Process user interface (labels, interface etc.)  \nMR| 1 week| This cookie is used to measure the use of the website for analytical purposes.  \nsmclient| 10 years| A cookie itself does not contain any information that enables to identify contacts and to recognize e.g. personal data of the website visitor.
