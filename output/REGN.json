(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the resubmission of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) to treat adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) whose disease is not adequately controlled with H1 antihistamine treatment. The target action date for the FDA decision is April 18, 2025. The resubmitted sBLA is supported by data from the multi-trial, LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 clinical program ([Study A](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=O5TXRoztzdwqE52g8SHxs1qfLbIJpiOOqEiem1zm1DHCA6iUEqwM1J3TlmeV02E_sp2cqFg5s8PDNdBhUnxFzYCbMPNgrui0a-jLDmpR3hXczv2ljLyY9Zyl2cUPHChLSb7kxMz_hzE6H-2_HWCdbTNN9qds9FUOnlIdECf8wwAKVu3uYeuMkhVtRGEqJt_1EYvVeyVlXQkYvJls8MAMz0VHJ5RdUcQVW6-GThFJXvTaqt4b6rxj5zTWG__SkdHG5lYEsKuy_n2lM6QEESyj4-ME828Jzf-JY9La8e2W4kNiOjPHfQJ_9dTEhhIvTOMcQWaisRdUHF1XBtffoAYQcHN79ePeLj9cqmZ3Yek1mhJAWukTbSo_Hhd9bqNe8f9a-X2z4ru235JsTu56MmxKI52clwBPv1u1c4vP8HRnOkkOSa9x0DI3RVMTWjzCyeJeBqgrgIsLTUwdnwDP3QAjBEkQdD7num4VOzKsPWe2Fm95TvLkfxAH_08iphVZ_Wik), [Study B](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=O5TXRoztzdwqE52g8SHxs7ZRsRJN3u_IoqeZaTXSPGka6dCVVuc2zh2-gDsDSzG2Blx8-qPmyWRq3pND8mYrJDPa7qVE-7T163-_urieBCjlO2w-NQrTep3Yl7J7bG-3NdRpxQgVYuTEHxOz3IThr5CRsnRN5JwHZHqYYpP5I1kdSgEQesGFOvfVcZVPkqjQmajMnGCqukry-K0SwUV3xg==), and [Study C](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=O5TXRoztzdwqE52g8SHxs2LSDk6NTIUUgySbd4HuTwXBEk5rvOQ8Gvi_STD3AJTTZnkVJJ3aTivkzRwOfOCaJLgXB9yNGImQMwNcrWGVGZnwjItSHVFCcDNYN9cb7Yaj3J7OpI8PkqVmvueC0PUWUOX1vWaPCQqnzAzwCjZnTJrATMpSyWZPkMpVeX8pMZXf3QNT954UFsH74R5V9OdUAA==)) for Dupixent in CSU. The sBLA adds results from Study C, which was conducted in patients with uncontrolled CSU who were on standard-of-care antihistamines. Study C, the second LIBERTY-CUPID pivotal trial in biologic-naïve patients, met its primary and key secondary endpoints confirming results seen in the previous Study A. Results showed Dupixent significantly reduced itch and urticaria activity (itch and hives).\n\nSafety results in all LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo were injection site reactions and COVID-19 infection.\n\n**About Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)** CSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation, which causes sudden and debilitating hives and recurring itch. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines, medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However, the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients, some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life. More than 300,000 people in the U.S. suffer from CSU that is inadequately controlled by antihistamines.\n\n**About Dupixent in CSU** The LIBERTY-CUPID Phase 3 study program evaluating Dupixent for CSU consists of Study A, Study B, and Study C. Study A and Study C were conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory or intolerant to omalizumab.\n\nDupixent has been approved for CSU in Japan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is also under regulatory review in the European Union based on earlier trial readouts. Outside of Japan and the UAE, the safety and efficacy of Dupixent for CSU has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\n**About Dupixent** Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary _VelocImmune_ _®_ technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation that play a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.\n\nDupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, CSU, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than 1,000,000 patients are currently being treated with Dupixent globally.1\n\n**About Regeneron’s**** _VelocImmune_****Technology** Regeneron's  _VelocImmune_ technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W.

This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb), Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz® (pozelimab-bbfg).\n\n**Dupilumab Development Program** Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.\n\nIn addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\n**U.S. INDICATIONS **\n\nDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:\n\n  * to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.\n  * with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.\n  * with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps under 12 years of age.\n  * to treat adults and children 1 year of age and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), who weigh at least 33 pounds (15 kg). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with eosinophilic esophagitis under 1 year of age, or who weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).\n  * to treat adults with prurigo nodularis (PN). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with prurigo nodularis under 18 years of age.\n  * with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a high number of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that may contribute to your COPD). DUPIXENT is used to reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days) and can improve your breathing.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced new and updated data from its hematology pipeline will be shared across 23 abstracts at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2024 Annual Meeting, taking place from December 7-10 in San Diego, CA. The latest research advances demonstrate the potential of Regeneron’s diverse pipeline, which aims to address unmet needs in ten types of blood cancers and disorders. These innovative and differentiated approaches include CD3 bispecific antibodies, costimulatory bispecific antibodies, and a pioneering combination of a monoclonal antibody and small interfering RNA (siRNA).\n\n“Our presentations at ASH demonstrate the progress we are making toward transforming care for a range of blood cancers and disorders where advancements are desperately needed,” said L. Andres Sirulnik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Hematology Clinical Development Unit Head at Regeneron. “These include new head-to-head data exploring a novel combination that aims to maximize disease control in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria compared to a standard-of-care treatment, as well as initial results from our confirmatory odronextamab trial in first-line follicular lymphoma. Together, our presentations underscore our commitment to work towards translating scientific breakthroughs to differentiated medicines for hematology patients.”\n\nAt ASH, abstracts in blood disorders include an oral presentation from an exploratory cohort of a Phase 3 trial investigating a novel combination of pozelimab with cemdisiran compared to ravulizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who were naïve to complement inhibition at baseline. Notably, the presentation will detail interim results from patients who were initially randomized to ravulizumab but crossed over to the combination in an open label extension portion of the trial.\n\nProgress on the odronextamab development program will be featured in twelve abstracts. Among them are initial results in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) from Part 1 of the Phase 3 OLYMPIA-1 confirmatory trial, which consists of a non-randomized safety run-in (Part 1) followed by a randomized efficacy portion (Part 2) comparing odronextamab monotherapy to rituximab plus standard-of-care chemotherapies. Two oral presentations on the ELM-1 and pivotal ELM-2 trials will feature new analyses in settings with significant unmet needs: one in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who progressed after CAR-T therapy and the other in relapsed/refractory (R/R) marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).\n\nOther notable abstracts include the latest linvoseltamab efficacy and safety results from the pivotal LINKER-MM1 study in R/R multiple myeloma (MM), preclinical data evaluating a CD38xCD28 costimulatory bispecific antibody in combination with linvoseltamab, and preclinical data on TMPRSS6 inhibition in beta-thalassemia.\n\nThe full list of Regeneron presentations at ASH includes: \n\n**Abstract Title** | **Abstract** | **Presenter** | **Session Date/Time (PT)**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Odronextamab**  \nEfficacy and Safety of Odronextamab Monotherapy in Patients (Pts) with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Progressing after CAR T-Cell Therapy: Primary Analysis from the ELM-1 Study | Abstract #866Oral PresentationSession | Matthew Matasar | Monday, December 9, at 2:45-4:15 pmMarriott Marquis San Diego Marina, Pacific Ballroom Salons 15-17  \nEfficacy and Safety of Odronextamab in Relapsed/Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma (R/R MZL): Data from the R/R MZL Cohort in the ELM-2 Study | Abstract #862Oral PresentationSession | Tae Min Kim | Monday, December 9, at 2:45-4:15 pmMarriott Marquis San Diego Marina, Marriott Grand Ballroom 11-13  \nOdronextamab Monotherapy in Previously Untreated Patients with High-Risk Follicular Lymphoma (FL): Results of the Safety Lead-in of the Phase 3 OLYMPIA-1 Study | Abstract #4411Poster PresentationSession | Elizabeth Brem | Monday, December 9, at 6:00-8:00 pmSan Diego Convention Center, Halls G-H  \nEfficacy and Safety of Odronextamab in Rare Subtypes of Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL): Data from a Dedicated Cohort of Other B-NHLs in the ELM-2 Study | Abstract #4502Poster PresentationSession | Emmanuel Bachy | Monday, December 9, at 6:00-8:00 pmSan Diego Convention Center, Halls G-H  \nTreatment Duration and Risk of Fatal Infections in Patients with B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Achieving Complete Response with Odronextamab | Abstract #3080Poster Presentation | Gottfried von Keudel | Monday, December 9, at 6:00-8:00 pmSan Diego Convention Center, Halls G-H  \nDynamics of Complete Responses in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Treated with Odronextamab in the ELM-2 Study | Abstract #4486Poster PresentationSession | Sabarish Ayyappan | Monday, December 9, at 6:00-8:00 pmSan Diego Convention Center, Halls G-H  \nLong-Term Efficacy and Safety of Odronextamab in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL): Pooled Analysis from ELM-1 and ELM-2 Studies | Abstract #3118Poster PresentationSession | John N.
