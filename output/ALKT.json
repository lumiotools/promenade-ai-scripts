Their mindset dictates the toolset and skillset that, in combination, are strongly correlated with better products, faster execution, and higher revenue growth than their peers,\" said Allison Cerra, chief marketing officer at Alkami.\n\nKey findings from the research include:\n\n  * A strong correlation between digital maturity and revenue growth, where financial institutions leading in digital maturity are growing at nearly 10 times the rate of their less advanced counterparts.\n  * Three foundational pillars that define business digital maturity: user experience (UX), employee productivity and mindset/culture.\n  * Financial institutions that prioritize digital investment and execution are more likely to view megabanks as their primary competitors and to quickly close gaps in their digital offerings.\n  * Digital maturity leaders often skew larger in asset size, however, one in five leaders has less than $1 billion in assets, showing that smaller institutions can outperform larger ones.\n  * Conversely, over one in five of the least digitally mature financial institutions hold more than $10 billion in assets, proving that size alone does not ensure digital leadership.\n\n\n\nResearch analysts benchmarked the financial institutions in the study, and categorized them into four cohorts of maturity, each with a clear strategic path for progression in their digital maturity. Whether it's investing in critical technologies, optimizing user experiences, or exploring advanced automation, the report outlines actionable steps for financial institutions at every stage of maturity.\n\n\"As we saw in our Retail Digital Sales & Service Maturity Model research, size is not always the determining factor in digital maturity,\" said Jim Marous, owner and chief executive officer of the Digital Banking Report. \"Our research shows that financial institutions of all sizes can lead by adopting a data-informed mindset, investing in technology, and fostering a culture that values data and digital innovation.\"\n\nTo explore the four Business Banking Digital Maturity cohorts and other research insights, _[click here for](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4307012-1&h=2918440653&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alkami.com%2Fresource%2Fbusiness-banking-digital-maturity-model%2F%3Futm_source%3Dearned_media%26utm_medium%3Dpress_release%26utm_campaign%3D2024-PR-Influencer-Maturity-Model-Business&a=click+here+for)_ the full report.\n\nTo explore the Retail Digital Sales & Service Maturity Model research report, _[click here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4307012-1&h=4104606067&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alkami.com%2Fresource%2Fbusiness-banking-digital-maturity-model%2F%3Futm_source%3Dearned_media%26utm_medium%3DRetail_Digital_Sales_Service_Maturity_Model%26utm_campaign%3D2024-PR-Influencer-Maturity-Model-Business&a=click+here)_.
