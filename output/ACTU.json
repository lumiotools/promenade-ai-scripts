(NASDAQ: ACTU) (“Actuate” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing therapies for the treatment of high-impact, difficult-to-treat cancers through the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted rare pediatric disease designation to elraglusib, a novel GSK-3β inhibitor for treatment of Ewing sarcoma (EWS).\n\n“Receiving rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA underscores the urgent need for new treatment options for patients with EWS and recognizes elraglusib’s transformative potential,” said Daniel Schmitt, President & Chief Executive Officer of Actuate. “Early clinical data from our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial show promising anti-tumor activity with objective tumor responses, including two ongoing durable Complete Responses (CRs) in the first six patients treated with relapsed/refractory EWS, reinforcing our confidence in elraglusib’s potential impact in this challenging disease setting. We are committed to advancing elraglusib’s clinical development with the ultimate goal of providing new therapeutic options where current approaches are unsatisfactory.”\n\nEwing sarcoma (EWS) is a highly metastatic form of sarcoma, originating in bone with a peak incidence at the age of 15, that ranks as the second most prevalent primary malignant tumor of childhood and adolescence. Approximately 25% of new EWS patients have metastatic disease when first diagnosed, which is the most significant predictor of poor survival. The ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial ([NCT 04239092](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ghUfV9bIAilMYp_MkxDSFIkasvGjwgaAjkYmr3gmASwgv6uXllTQF1lt1lzfodBWU5aeGpwMhbhcl5lCyyr6Z2TaKn99YQ9OPGRiMkvspvEGJ9AqXxhdYORGZ6ZWacAIZbOLqf3KFbPSdAw2ECYtFVlm7pAemRjsDw_KIe95YfufrDxWYNAA4DaaD_jGc-YJXciFlm1S-BJEWkmXI7WZPYjgE1FhKlFY0ySA-KHp2AwxGugdSuUCtknPqWc6nYOwVM3pB8lsSeSnEkQjRsd-G1pXwgmhR3CDK9o0Zy8IPJIj4gsToHGrlgN0wnv6zEhJ \"NCT 04239092\")), also referred to as Actuate-1902, is an open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and efficacy of elraglusib in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory malignancies, including EWS and EWS-related pediatric small round cell sarcomas. To date, the study has enrolled 8 patients with relapsed/refractory EWS (>1 remission) treated with the combination of elraglusib and topotecan/cyclophosphamide.\n\nRare Pediatric Disease Designation is granted by the FDA for serious or life-threatening diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States and in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals less than 18 years of age. If, in the future, a New Drug Application (NDA) for elraglusib for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma is approved by the FDA, Actuate will be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) that could be utilized by the Company or potentially sold to another company for its use.\n\n**About Actuate Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nActuate is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for the treatment of high-impact, difficult-to-treat cancers.

(NASDAQ: ACTU) (“Actuate” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing therapies for the treatment of high-impact, difficult-to-treat cancers through the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), announced the _Scientific Reports_ publication of novel mechanistic data for its development candidate, elraglusib.\n\nThe article, entitled, “ _Targeted inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase_ _‑_ _3 using 9_ _‑_ _ING_ _‑_ _41 (elraglusib) enhances CD8 T_ _‑_ _cell_ _‑_ _reactivity against neuroblastoma cells_ ” is [available online.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DGRVplC6ix3glbl_aeEgL-1ZeBgYfJ73t2Tc5sLbZLAD7Pwgv6IVqL2xvlQymYQN7OedaOt0JJEUYAB3aizc8f2obTVop-qVw3UQa85I2kCITZlhI8Dbz94vhhoX87Wj \"available online.\")\n\n“The mechanistic data published in Scientific Reports provides crucial evidence of elraglusib’s ability to enhance activation of the immune system by tumor cells,” said Daniel Schmitt, President & Chief Executive Officer of Actuate. “By improving antigen presentation and enhancing the activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, we are paving the way for more effective immunotherapeutic strategies including combinations of elraglusib with checkpoint inhibitors.” Using neuroblastoma, which is typically refractory to checkpoint inhibitors, as a model system, these findings illustrate the potential to activate the immune system even in cancers that have not previously responded to checkpoint inhibitors and underscore elraglusib’s potential as a highly innovative treatment for challenging cancers.\n\nThe summary of key mechanistic findings:\n\n  * Elraglusib significantly enhances MHC-I molecule surface expression of neuroblastoma cells, improving their recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)\n  * Treatment with elraglusib leads to the disruption of NK-κB signaling, a key contributor to tumor cell survival, promoting cancer cell apoptosis and reducing treatment resistance\n  * Elraglusib boosts IFNγ signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway, particularly STAT1, which further supports improved antigen presentation and immune response\n  * When combined with an anti-PD-1 treatment, elraglusib boosted CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation by neuroblastoma cells, showing potential for further development of these tumor immune response enhancing therapeutics.\n\n\n\n“Despite the clinical benefit observed with checkpoint inhibitors in many advanced cancer types, the majority of patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors fail to respond,” said Dr. Andrew Mazar, Actuate’s Scientific Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer. “The ability to enhance immunogenicity in a tumor such as neuroblastoma that is not unrecognized by the immune system, holds therapeutic promise for neuroblastoma patients and could potentially be translated for the treatment of other immunologically cold tumors as well.”\n\nElraglusib is currently being evaluated in Phase 2 Trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer [(NCT03678883)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8m6iIbB7hKH9BOx_nzekJWhgPcXWVWdGJmOBxaX98SqqYl3uNZRHH_a_laeexBkBB3SmoNKHFuyGR58U4O57YY-RZX1dqkwYTzm8T2gXn1dyTmjgFvMsNqIQOt_pb5IQ \"\\(NCT03678883\\)\") and Phase 1/2 Trial [(NCT04239092)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8m6iIbB7hKH9BOx_nzekJR1jEHhUn1MV3QrcXVhg6Sd2VoX0lURV8kR21ICmLIhtQRpkprgyskvvr9FioQRnV2twWL55NEqwgkR-nkqY9DnLLWEAbKD1dj0zBNMQxNFYeqBxInlTwEz_sCKCpHZH3g== \"\\(NCT04239092\\)\") in Ewing Sarcoma (EWS) and EWS-related sarcomas.\n\n**About Actuate Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nActuate is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for the treatment of high-impact, difficult-to-treat cancers.

(NASDAQ: ACTU) (“Actuate” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing therapies for the treatment of high-impact, difficult-to-treat cancers through the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for elraglusib, a novel GSK-3β inhibitor for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (STS).\n\n“We are pleased to receive the ODD from the FDA, which underscores elraglusib’s potential to address the significant yet unmet medical needs for patients with advanced cancers,” said Daniel Schmitt, President & Chief Executive Officer of Actuate. “Elraglusib is a leading GSK-3β inhibitor that has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and antitumor activity across several solid tumors including melanoma, Ewing sarcoma, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. We look forward to the continued development of elraglusib and working closely with regulators to deliver its promise to cancer patients.”\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, it is projected that in 2024 alone, approximately 13,590 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma will be diagnosed in the United States. Additionally, an estimated 5,200 individuals are expected to die from this disease1.\n\n“Soft tissue sarcomas are a rare but heterogeneous mix of tumors with >70 histological subtypes identified to date making sarcoma difficult to treat. Surgery remains the most effective treatment for localized cancer with median survival approaching 50%. However, patients with metastatic disease have a median overall survival of less than 6-12 months and remain a therapeutic challenge. Doxorubicin, approved almost 50 years ago, remains the recommended 1st line systemic treatment despite exhibiting minimal antitumor activity highlighting the unmet medical need for patients with metastatic STS,” said Dr. Steven D. Reich, Senior VP, Clinical Development and Acting Chief Medical Officer of Actuate. “Preclinical studies have demonstrated that elraglusib induces significant STS cell apoptosis and synergistic effects with chemotherapy providing rationale for the clinical evaluation in metastatic STS.”\n\nThe FDA’s Orphan Drug Designation FDA Orphan Drug Designation is granted to investigational therapies addressing rare medical diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug status provides benefits to drug developers, including assistance in the drug development process, tax credits for clinical costs, exemptions from certain FDA fees, and seven years of post-approval marketing exclusivity.\n\n1 American Cancer Society.

The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. All statements, other than statements related to present facts or current conditions or of historical facts, contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Accordingly, these statements involve estimates, assumptions, substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in them, including but not limited to that clinical and preclinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain timelines and outcomes, results of prior preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and elraglusib may not achieve favorable results in clinical trials or preclinical studies or receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all; that we may not successfully enroll additional patients or establish or advance plans for further development; that elraglusib could be associated with side effects, adverse events or other properties or safety risks, which could delay or preclude regulatory approval, cause us to suspend or discontinue clinical trials or result in other negative consequences; our reliance on third parties to conduct our non-clinical studies and our clinical trials; our reliance on third-party licensors and ability to preserve and protect our intellectual property rights; that we face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies; and our ability to fund development activities. In addition, any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act with respect to our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-279734) and other filings with the SEC. Because the risk factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Unless legally required, we do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n\n**Investor Contact**\n\nMike Moyer\n\nManaging Director\n\nLifeSci Advisors, LLC\n\nmmoyer@lifesciadvisors.com\n\n![]()\n\n[ < VIEW ALL NEWS > ](https://actuatetherapeutics.com/investors/news/)\n\nX\n\nThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.
