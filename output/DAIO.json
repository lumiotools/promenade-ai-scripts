Commenting on his view of the Company, Mr. Wentworth said, “I am excited to have been appointed to lead Data I/O given the substantial market opportunities that set the stage for heightened value creation for our customers, business partners and shareholders. This is possible because of the impressive building blocks in place with the Company. We intend to leverage our technology platform, our significant intellectual property portfolio and our highly experienced engineering team. “During this transitional time, our team is thoroughly engaged in defining the future direction of the Company to drive growth and implement transformative strategies for Data I/O to become a higher value supply chain partner. The focus over the last month has been assessing our strengths and weaknesses while visiting our customers and business partners. Our findings have been encouraging as we set our sights on initiatives grounded in a reimagined approach to the markets we serve and how our capabilities are best utilized to support the global electronics supply chain. Many of these initiatives are based on improvement and expansion of existing strategies selling to global providers of semiconductors, Electronics Manufacturing Service providers, and independent service providers. \n\n“The team will leverage technology to enhance customer engagement strategies, fill out our product portfolio and improve speed-to-market. In turn, we anticipate capturing a greater percentage of what customers spend across their entire enterprise. Furthermore, diversification of revenue streams and customer segmentation will be important elements to our go-forward strategy. Data I/O is dominant in the Automotive Electronics sector and we intend to diversify our approach to the markets we serve to create strongholds in other electronics sectors.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nNet sales in the third quarter 2024 were $5.4 million, down 17% compared with $6.6 million in the third quarter 2023. Since the beginning of the year, automotive electronics uncertainty has increased and customer capacity expansion has slowed, resulting in lower system shipments in the Americas and Europe which are offsetting growth in Asia. While the automotive system results are below expectations, the Company continues to achieve steady performance from programming centers, industrial markets, and its recurring revenue offerings. Third quarter 2024 recurring services and consumable adapter sales increased by 6% from the prior year, while system sales declined by 34% during the same periods.\n\nThird-quarter bookings mirrored sales at $4.7 million, down from $5.3 million in the prior year. Backlog remains strong at $4.7 million as of September 30, 2024, down $0.7 million from the start of the quarter, with further reductions expected as planned customer deliveries occur in future quarters.\n\nGross margin as a percentage of sales was 53.9% in the third quarter 2024, as compared to 53.7% in the prior year period. Despite lower sales volume, gross margin as a percentage of sales remained at steady levels due to product mix favoring software and services over reduced system sales, and successful efforts to improve material, production and service costs through ongoing cost reduction initiatives.\n\nOperating expenses in the third quarter 2024 were $3.2 million, down $334,000 or 9% from the prior year period and down $1.3 million or 11% year-to-date compared to the prior year. All operational areas including manufacturing, service, R&D and SG&A contributed to these reductions through efficiency improvements and cost reduction efforts.\n\nNet loss in the third quarter 2024 was ($307,000), or ($0.03) per share, compared with net loss of ($53,000), or ($0.01) per share, in the third quarter 2023. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), which excludes equity compensation, was $37,000 in the third quarter 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $402,000 in the third quarter 2023.\n\nThe Company’s balance sheet remained strong with cash of $12.4 million at the end of the third quarter 2024 compared to $11.4 million on June 30, 2024 and $12.3 million on December 31, 2023. Cash increased from the beginning of the year due to reduced operating expenses and improved collections of receivables, partially offset by operating losses, higher inventories, cash expenses paid annually in the first quarter, and the second quarter tax repatriation expense of approximately $337,000.\n\nInventories at $6.6 million at the end of the third quarter 2024 increased from $5.9 million on December 31, 2023, due to lower system shipments year-to-date and anticipation of future backlog reductions based on the timing of contractual orders. Data I/O had net working capital of $17.6 million on September 30, 2024 compared to $18.4 million on December 31, 2023. The Company continues to have no debt. **Conference Call Information** A conference call discussing financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 will follow this release today at 2 p.m. Pacific Time/5 p.m. Eastern Time.
