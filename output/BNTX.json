The transaction is part of BioNTech’s oncology strategy, aimed at enhancing the company’s capabilities to research, develop and commercialize combination therapies using BNT327/PM8002. Clinical trials with BNT327/PM8002 and the PD-(L)1 x VEGF bispecific class of drugs have demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in various tumor types including in patients with PD-L1-low and -negative tumors who have typically been less responsive to current checkpoint inhibitor treatments. \n\n“The acquisition of Biotheus builds on our successful ongoing collaboration on BNT327/PM8002 and other investigational bispecific antibodies,” said **Prof. Ugur Sahin, M.D., Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of BioNTech**. \"We believe that BNT327/PM8002 has the potential to set a new standard of care in multiple oncology indications, surpassing traditional checkpoint inhibitors. We are committed to advancing its research and development in combination with our investigational mRNA vaccines, targeted therapies, and immunomodulators with the aim of enhancing outcomes for patients with solid tumors.\"\n\n“We are thrilled to deepen our bond with BioNTech. We share the goal of advancing the development of BNT327/PM8002 for future combination therapies in the fight against cancer,” said **Xiaolin Liu, President, CEO, and Co-Founder of Biotheus**. “We believe that BNT327/PM8002 holds significant potential across various tumor indications, and we have an exciting pipeline of innovative investigational assets under development including an antibody discovery and development platform. As we move forward, we are committed to leveraging our strengths with the aim of advancing transformative cancer treatments and enhance our ability to develop treatments for patients in need.”\n\nBNT327/PM8002 has shown encouraging efficacy and tolerability in patients across various tumor types, with more than 700 patients treated in clinical trials to date. Multiple registrational trials are planned to start in 2024 and 2025, evaluating BNT327/PM8002 plus chemotherapy in various solid tumor indications including in patients with small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. Additional trials will explore combining BNT327/PM8002 and BioNTech’s proprietary antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”). In June 2024, the evaluation of BNT327/PM8002 in combination with BNT325/DB-1305, a Trophoblast Cell-Surface Antigen 2 (“TROP2”)-targeted ADC candidate developed by BioNTech in collaboration with Duality Biologics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. (“DualityBio”), was initiated as part of an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05438329](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9mn6peK57vAMyV29lAJ9Fw_pniUv66JJQxrnJ4-dfaTC0R5wk9gqrE6ImlmNW9oHZevE_-cvFO3RmITg2mJKwlM8-YGT96MXGimyy65CErslHjpRss1km5k0n8srySHF)). \n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, BioNTech will pay Biotheus shareholders an upfront consideration of $800 million, predominantly in cash, with a small portion in American depositary shares (“ADS”), to acquire 100 percent of the issued share capital, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, plus additional performance-based contingent payments of up to $150 million if certain milestones are met. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The acquisition follows an initial exclusive global license and collaboration agreement between BioNTech and Biotheus, which closed in November 2023, granting BioNTech the rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize BNT327/PM8002 globally ex-Greater China. \n\nUpon closing, BioNTech will gain full rights to Biotheus’ pipeline candidates and its in-house bispecific antibody drug conjugate capability. The acquisition will expand BioNTech’s footprint in China, adding a local research and development hub to conduct clinical trials. In addition, BioNTech will gain a state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility to contribute to its future global manufacturing and supply, and more than 300 Biotheus employees in R&D, manufacturing and enabling functions are expected to join the BioNTech workforce. \n\n**BioNTech’s Innovation Series R &D Day **BioNTech leadership will present additional details on the Biotheus transaction, as well as updates on the corporate strategy, commercial strategy and clinical progress across its pipeline during an edition of the company’s Innovation Series R&D Day on 14 November.

A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the event’s conclusion and archived on BioNTech’s website for one year.\n\n**About BNT327/PM8002** BNT327/PM8002 is an investigational bispecific antibody combining PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition with VEGF-A neutralization. The checkpoint inhibition is aimed at restoring T cells’ ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells while targeting VEGF-A is aimed at inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, which cuts off the blood and oxygen supply that feeds tumor cells and thus prevents the tumor from growing and proliferating. The combined blockade of the PD-(L)1 pathway and the VEGF-A driven angiogenesis has been shown to deliver synergistically enhanced anti-tumor immune responses in several solid tumor types.i,ii If successfully developed and approved, BioNTech aims to use this bispecific antibody candidate as a new therapeutic backbone in combination with other treatment modalities targeting different oncogenic pathways.\n\n**About BioNTech** Biopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) is a global next generation immunotherapy company pioneering novel therapies for cancer and other serious diseases.

Shortly following approval, the updated vaccines were made available to European Union (“EU”) member states. The EC approved the co-administration of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine with approved seasonal influenza vaccines in individuals 12 years of age and older and also authorized glass pre-filled syringes, a new presentation of the vaccine that allows for refrigerated storage conditions. On September 24, 2024, the EC approved BioNTech and Pfizer’s Omicron KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccine. The companies began shipments of their KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccine to EU member states that ordered this formulation.\n  * On August 22, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved the companies’ KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccines were shipped immediately following approval and made available in pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics across the U.S. \n  * On July 24, 2024, the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) approved the companies’ JN.1-adapted vaccine and post period, on October 10, 2024, approved the companies’ KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccine.\n  * BioNTech and Pfizer will continue to monitor the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 and remain prepared to develop modified vaccine formulas as the data support and as regulatory agencies recommend.\n\n\n\n**COVID-19 – Influenza Combination Vaccine Program**\n\nAn mRNA-based combination vaccine candidate (**BNT162b2 + BNT161**) against COVID-19 and influenza is in development in collaboration with Pfizer.\n\n  * In August 2024, BioNTech and Pfizer provided topline results from the Phase 3 trial ([NCT06178991](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06178991)) evaluating the companies’ mRNA combination vaccine candidate in healthy individuals 18-64 years of age. The vaccine candidate was compared to the co-administration of a licensed influenza vaccine with the companies’ licensed COVID-19 vaccine. The primary immunogenicity objectives were non-inferiority of the antibody responses to influenza (hemagglutination inhibition) and to SARS-CoV-2 (neutralizing titer) elicited by the combination vaccine candidate as compared to standard of care. The trial showed higher influenza A responses and comparable COVID-19 responses versus the comparator vaccines but did not meet one of its primary immunogenicity objectives of non-inferiority against the influenza B strain. No safety signals with the combination vaccine candidate have been identified in an ongoing safety data review. BioNTech and Pfizer are evaluating adjustments to the candidate and will discuss next steps with health authorities.\n\n\n\n**_Select Oncology Pipeline Updates_**\n\n_Next-Generation Immune Checkpoint Immunomodulator Programs_\n\n**BNT327/PM8002** is a bispecific antibody candidate combining Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (“PD-L1”) checkpoint inhibition with Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (“VEGF-A”) neutralization and is being developed in collaboration with Biotheus Inc. (“Biotheus”). \n\n  * In October 2024, the first patient was dosed in a multi-site, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT06449222](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06449222)) to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of BNT327/PM8002 at two dose levels in combination with chemotherapy in the first- and second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced/metastatic triple negative breast cancer (“TNBC”). These data will inform a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line TNBC that is expected to start in 2025.\n  * In September 2024, the first patient was dosed in a multi-site, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT06449209](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06449209)) to evaluate BNT327/PM8002 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with untreated extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (“ES-SCLC”), and in patients with SCLC that progressed after first- or second-line treatment. These data will inform a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line SCLC that is expected to start in 2024.\n  * A Phase 2/3 clinical trial in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) is expected to start in 2024.\n  * In June 2024, evaluation of BNT327/PM8002 in combination with BNT325/DB-1305, a Trophoblast Cell-Surface Antigen 2 (“TROP2”)-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) candidate, was initiated as part of an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05438329](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05438329)). The clinical trial evaluates the safety and tolerability of BNT325/DB-1305 alone and in combination with BNT327/PM8002 in various solid tumor indications. Additional trials of novel BNT327/PM8002 combinations with proprietary ADCs are planned to start in 2024.\n  * In September 2024, data were presented from three clinical trials evaluating BNT327/PM8002 in patients with advanced TNBC, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (“EGFR”)-mutated NSCLC and renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) at the 2024 Congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”): \n    * Data from an ongoing open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05918133](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05918133)) evaluating BNT327/PM8002 in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC showed clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity regardless of PD-L1 status and a manageable safety profile with no new safety signals observed beyond those typically described for anti-PD-(L)1 therapies, anti-VEGF therapies, and chemotherapy.\n    * Data from a Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT05756972](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05756972)) evaluating BNT327/PM8002 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC who progressed after EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment showed encouraging anti-tumor activity regardless of PD-L1 status and a generally manageable safety profile. \n    * Data from an open-label multi-cohort Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05918445](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05918445)) evaluating BNT327/PM8002 monotherapy showed encouraging anti-tumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with previously untreated advanced non clear cell RCC or treated advanced clear cell RCC.\n  * Data in first-line TNBC are planned to be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, taking place from December 10 to December 13 in San Antonio, Texas, U.S. Additional data are expected to be presented in 2025.\n\n\n\n**BNT316/ONC-392 (gotistobart)** is an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (“CTLA-4”) monoclonal antibody candidate being developed in collaboration with OncoC4, Inc. (“OncoC4”).\n\n  * In October 2024, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 trial (PRESERVE-003; [NCT05671510](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05671510)) due to varying results between patient populations. The trial assesses the efficacy and safety of BNT316/ONC-392 as monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC that progressed under previous PD-(L)1-inhibitor treatment. Enrollment of new patients has been paused while patients already enrolled in the trial will continue to receive treatment. Trials evaluating BNT316/ONC-392 in other indications remain unaffected.\n  * In September 2024, preliminary data from the Phase 2 (PRESERVE-004; [NCT05446298](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05446298)) clinical trial evaluating BNT316/ONC-392 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were presented at ESMO. The data suggest encouraging preliminary clinical activity and a manageable tolerability profile with no new safety signals detected for the combination.\n\n\n\n _mRNA Cancer Vaccine_ _Programs_\n\nBNT111, BNT113 and autogene cevumeran (BNT122/RO7198457 _)_ are investigational vaccines for the treatment of cancer based on BioNTech’s systemically administered uridine mRNA-lipoplex technology. \n\n**BNT111** is based on BioNTech’s wholly owned, off-the-shelf FixVac platform, and encodes shared melanoma associated antigens. \n\n  * A randomized Phase 2 clinical trial (BNT111-01; [NCT04526899](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04526899)) is being conducted in collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Regeneron”) to evaluate BNT111 in combination with cemiplimab in patients with anti-PD-(L)1 refractory/relapsed, unresectable stage III or IV melanoma. \n  * In July 2024, BioNTech announced that the trial met its primary efficacy outcome measure, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall response rate (“ORR”) in patients treated with BNT111 in combination with cemiplimab, as compared to an historical control in this indication and treatment setting. The ORR in the cemiplimab monotherapy arm was in line with the historical control of anti-PD-(L)1 or anti-CTLA-4 treatments in this patient group. The treatment was generally well tolerated and the safety profile of BNT111 in combination with cemiplimab in this trial was consistent with previous clinical trials assessing BNT111 in combination with anti-PD-(L)1-containing treatments. The Phase 2 trial will continue as planned to further assess the secondary endpoints which were not mature at the time of the primary analysis.\n  * BioNTech plans to present data from this trial at an upcoming medical conference in 2025. \n\n\n\n**BNT113** is based on BioNTech’s FixVac platform encoding Human Papilloma Virus 16 (“HPV16”) antigens.\n\n  * A global, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial (AHEAD-MERIT; [NCT04534205](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04534205)) is being conducted to evaluate BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic, PD-L1+, HPV16+ head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. \n  * In September 2024, an exploratory analysis of antitumor activity (15 patients) and immunogenicity (3 patients) from the safety run-in of AHEAD-MERIT was presented at ESMO. The data support the tolerability of BNT113 and clinical activity in combination with pembrolizumab was observed. In addition, BNT113 was found to induce _de novo_ T-cell responses against HPV16 antigens. \n  * Also at ESMO, results were presented from an investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 dose escalation clinical trial (HARE-40; [NCT03418480](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03418480)) evaluating BNT113 alone in the post-adjuvant and metastatic settings in patients with HPV16+ head and neck and other cancers. BNT113 was shown to induce immune responses in patients in the adjuvant and end-stage clinical settings and to be overall well tolerated with a manageable safety profile. \n\n\n\n**Autogene cevumeran (BNT122/RO7198457)** is an mRNA cancer vaccine candidate for individualized neoantigen-specific immunotherapy (“iNeST”) being developed in collaboration with Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”), a member of the Roche Group (“Roche”). \n\n  * A randomized, double-blind, multi-site Phase 2 clinical trial (IMCODE-004; [NCT06534983](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06534983)) evaluating autogene cevumeran as an adjuvant treatment with nivolumab in patients with high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial cancer (“MIUC”) is enrolling patients. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of autogene cevumeran in combination with nivolumab compared to nivolumab alone in approximately 360 patients. The primary endpoint for the study is investigator-assessed disease-free survival (“DFS”). Secondary objectives include overall survival (“OS”) and safety.\n  * Autogene cevumeran is also being evaluated in ongoing Phase 2 trials in adjuvant resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDAC”) ([NCT05968326](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05968326)), adjuvant colorectal cancer (“CRC”) ([NCT04486378](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04486378)) and first-line advanced melanoma ([NCT03815058](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03815058)).\n  * BioNTech plans to disclose interim data from the Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT04486378](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04486378)) in stage II (high-risk) and III circulating tumor DNA+ (“ctDNA”) adjuvant CRC, which is projected for late 2025 or 2026.\n\n\n\n_ADC Programs_\n\n**BNT323/DB-1303** **(trastuzumab pamirtecan)** is an ADC candidate targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 (“HER2”) that is being developed in collaboration with Duality Biologics (Suzhou) Co. Ltd. (“DualityBio”). \n\n  * BNT323/DB-1303 is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05150691](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05150691)) in patients with advanced/unresectable, recurrent or metastatic HER2-expressing solid tumors. A potentially registrational cohort of patients with HER2-expressing (IHC3+, 2+, 1+ or ISH-positive) advanced/recurrent endometrial carcinoma has completed enrollment. Data from this cohort are expected in 2025.\n  * A confirmatory Phase 3 trial ([NCT06340568](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06340568)) in patients with advanced endometrial cancer is in planning.\n  * A pivotal Phase 3 trial (DYNASTY-Breast02; [NCT06018337](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06018337)) is being conducted in patients with Hormone Receptor-positive (“HR+”) and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer that progressed on hormone therapy and/or Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 (“CDK4/6”) inhibition. In September 2024, a Trial-in-Progress poster was presented at ESMO.\n  * Topline data from the ongoing Phase 3 trial in HR+ and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer that have progressed on hormone therapy and/or CDK4/6 inhibition are expected in 2026.\n\n\n\n**BNT324/DB-1311** is an ADC candidate targeting B7H3 that is being developed in collaboration with DualityBio. \n\n  * A first-in-human, open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05914116](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05914116)) in patients with advanced solid tumors is ongoing.\n  * In July 2024, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to BNT324/DB-1311 for the treatment of advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n  * The first preliminary data update from this trial is expected to be presented at the ESMO Asia Congress (December 6-8, 2024 in Singapore).\n\n\n\n**BNT326/YL202** is an ADC candidate targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor 3 (“HER3”) that is being developed in collaboration with MediLink Therapeutics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. (“MediLink”).\n\n  * A multi-site, international, open-label, first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial ([NCT05653752](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05653752?term=NCT05653752&rank=1)) sponsored by MediLink evaluating BNT326/YL202 as a later-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC or HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer is ongoing. On August 15, 2024, the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold that was placed on this trial, initially announced on June 17, 2024. Trial recruitment has been reinitiated with a focus on dose levels no higher than 3 mg/kg, where the safety profile was manageable and encouraging clinical activity was observed.\n\n\n\n_Cell Therapy Programs_\n\n**BNT211** consists of a chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”)-T cell product candidate targeting Claudin-6 (“CLDN6”)-positive solid tumors in combination with a CAR-T cell-amplifying RNA vaccine (“CARVac”) encoding CLDN6.\n\n  * A first-in-human, open-label, multi-site Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion basket trial ([NCT04503278](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04503278)) is being conducted to evaluate BNT211 in patients with CLDN6-positive relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including ovarian cancers and testicular germ cell tumors.\n  * In September 2024, data from the ongoing trial presented at ESMO showed signs of antitumor activity across indications. CARVac was shown to improve CAR-T persistence in some patients. The data also suggested that the safety profile of CLDN6 CAR T cells with and without CARVac is consistent with the previously published effects of CAR T therapies and that repeated CARVac administration does not significantly increase toxicity. \n  * A pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with testicular germ cell tumors is expected to start in 2025 based on encouraging activity observed in this patient group.\n\n\n\n**Corporate Update for the Third Quarter 2024 and Key Post Period-End Events**\n\n  * On October 1, 2024, BioNTech, alongside its artificial intelligence (“AI _”)_ subsidiary InstaDeep, presented an overview of its AI approach during an edition of the Company’s Innovation Series called AI Day.

In particular, we initiated later-stage trials and shared important updates for our PD-L1 x VEGF-A bispecific antibody candidate BNT327/PM8002 and for our mRNA cancer vaccine portfolio. These successes reinforce the potential of our multi-platform technology approach and inform our strategy to pursue novel proprietary combinations,” **said Prof. Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-Founder of BioNTech**. “We remain focused on advancing our late-stage oncology product candidates towards potential registration.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were €1,561.1 million, compared to €2,340.0 million for the comparative prior year period. The higher revenues in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the comparative prior year period can be largely attributed to the earlier approvals received for its variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines as compared to last year. \n\n**Cost of sales** were €178.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to €161.8 million for the comparative prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales were €297.8 million, compared to €420.7 million for the comparative prior year period.\n\n**Research and development** (“R&D”) expenses were €550.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to €497.9 million for the comparative prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R&D expenses were €1,642.4 million, compared to €1,205.3 million for the comparative prior year period. R&D expenses were mainly influenced by progressing clinical studies for the Company’s late-stage oncology pipeline candidates.\n\n**Sales, general and administrative** (“SG&A”) expenses2, in total, amounted to €150.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to €153.5 million for the comparative prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG&A expenses were €466.9 million, compared to €415.4 million for the comparative prior year period. SG&A expenses were mainly influenced by personnel expenses. \n\n**Other operating result** amounted to negative €354.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to negative €9.0 million for the comparative prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other operating result amounted to negative €616.9 million compared to negative €134.4 million for the prior year period. Other operating result was primarily influenced by provisions for contractual disputes.\n\n**Income taxes** were realized with an amount of €39.4 million in tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to €66.8 million in accrued tax expenses for the comparative prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income taxes were realized with an amount of €54.1 million in tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to €50.5 million of accrued tax expenses for the comparative prior year period.\n\n**Net profit** was €198.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to €160.6 million net profit for the comparative prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was €924.8 million, compared to a net profit of €472.4 million for the comparative prior year period.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents plus security investments** as of September 30, 2024, reached €17,839.8 million, comprising €9,624.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, €7,078.0 million in current security investments and €1,137.2 million in non-current security investments.\n\n**Diluted earnings per share** was €0.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to €0.66 for the comparative prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss per share was €3.83, compared to diluted earnings per share of €1.94 for the comparative prior year period.\n\n**Shares outstanding** as of September 30, 2024, were 239,739,752, excluding 8,812,448 shares held in treasury.\n\n“We successfully launched our variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines upon receipt of earlier approvals as compared to last year. This drove our strong revenues in the third quarter,” **said Jens Holstein, CFO of BioNTech**. “Our cost discipline in combination with our financial position allow us to continue to focus on those assets that we believe offer a fast path to market and the highest potential to generate value for patients and shareholders.”\n\n**2024 Financial Year Guidance 3 **\n\nThe Company expects its revenues for the full 2024 financial year to be at the low end of the guidance range provided in its outlook: \n\n**Total revenues for the 2024 financial year** |  **low end of €2.5 billion - €3.1 billion**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe range reflects certain assumptions and expectations, including, but not limited to: COVID-19 vaccine uptake and price levels, including seasonal variations; inventory write-downs and other charges by BioNTech’s collaboration partner Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) that negatively influence BioNTech’s revenues; anticipated revenues from a pandemic preparedness contract with the German government; and revenues from the BioNTech Group service businesses, namely InstaDeep Ltd (“InstaDeep”), JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH, and BioNTech Innovative Manufacturing Services GmbH. Generally, the Company continues to remain largely dependent on revenues generated in its collaboration partner’s territories in 2024.\n\n**2024 Financial Year Expenses and Capex**\n\nThe Company has reduced its previous guidance for expected SG&A expenses and capital expenditures for operating activities for the 2024 financial year:\n\n**Guidance March 2024** |  **Guidance November 2024**  \n---|---  \n**R &D expenses4** |  **€2,400 million - €2,600 million** |  **€2,400 million - €2,600 million**  \n**SG &A expenses** |  **€700 million - €800 million** |  **€600 million - €700 million**  \n**Capital expenditures for operating activities** |  **€400 million - €500 million** |  **€300 million - €400 million**  \n  \nThe full interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements can be found in BioNTech’s Report on Form 6-K for the period ended September 30, 2024, filed today with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and available at [https://www.sec.gov/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rXVcbt41-zD-QG7kfKgLr9L6-4adGYQITuxV3mSfJnk9plblCy0VsVV_hjEV3pnvWbOyHUew9KldJsuq-808mHeB52ZfHVje9TzjFmC9Hyw=).\n\n**Endnotes** 1Calculated applying the average foreign exchange rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as published by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank).\n\n2 SG&A expenses include sales and marketing expenses as well as general and administrative expenses.\n\n3Guidance excludes external risks that are not yet known and/or quantifiable. It does not include potential payments resulting from the outcomes of ongoing and/or future legal disputes or related activity, such as judgements or settlements, or other extraordinary items, all of which may have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations and/or cash flows. BioNTech continues to expect to report a loss for the 2024 financial year.\n\n4 Guidance for R&D expenses reflects the expected impact of collaborations and potential M&A transactions, in each case to the extent disclosed, and which are subject to change based on future developments. Guidance does not otherwise reflect M&A, collaboration or licensing transactions that the Company may enter into in the future.\n\n**Operational Review of the Third Quarter 2024, Key Post Period-End Events and Outlook**\n\n**Variant-adapted COVID-19 Vaccines**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, BioNTech and Pfizer executed the commercial launch of their variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024/2025 vaccination season.\n\n  * On July 3, 2024, BioNTech and Pfizer’s Omicron JN.1-adapted COVID-19 vaccine was approved by the European Commission (“EC”). Shortly following approval, the updated vaccines were made available to European Union (“EU”) member states. The EC approved the co-administration of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine with approved seasonal influenza vaccines in individuals 12 years of age and older and also authorized glass pre-filled syringes, a new presentation of the vaccine that allows for refrigerated storage conditions. On September 24, 2024, the EC approved BioNTech and Pfizer’s Omicron KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccine. The companies began shipments of their KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccine to EU member states that ordered this formulation.\n  * On August 22, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved the companies’ KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccines were shipped immediately following approval and made available in pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics across the U.S. \n  * On July 24, 2024, the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) approved the companies’ JN.1-adapted vaccine and post period, on October 10, 2024, approved the companies’ KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccine.\n  * BioNTech and Pfizer will continue to monitor the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 and remain prepared to develop modified vaccine formulas as the data support and as regulatory agencies recommend.\n\n\n\n**COVID-19 – Influenza Combination Vaccine Program**\n\nAn mRNA-based combination vaccine candidate (**BNT162b2 + BNT161**) against COVID-19 and influenza is in development in collaboration with Pfizer.\n\n  * In August 2024, BioNTech and Pfizer provided topline results from the Phase 3 trial ([NCT06178991](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06178991)) evaluating the companies’ mRNA combination vaccine candidate in healthy individuals 18-64 years of age. The vaccine candidate was compared to the co-administration of a licensed influenza vaccine with the companies’ licensed COVID-19 vaccine. The primary immunogenicity objectives were non-inferiority of the antibody responses to influenza (hemagglutination inhibition) and to SARS-CoV-2 (neutralizing titer) elicited by the combination vaccine candidate as compared to standard of care. The trial showed higher influenza A responses and comparable COVID-19 responses versus the comparator vaccines but did not meet one of its primary immunogenicity objectives of non-inferiority against the influenza B strain. No safety signals with the combination vaccine candidate have been identified in an ongoing safety data review. BioNTech and Pfizer are evaluating adjustments to the candidate and will discuss next steps with health authorities.\n\n\n\n**_Select Oncology Pipeline Updates_**\n\n_Next-Generation Immune Checkpoint Immunomodulator Programs_\n\n**BNT327/PM8002** is a bispecific antibody candidate combining Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (“PD-L1”) checkpoint inhibition with Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (“VEGF-A”) neutralization and is being developed in collaboration with Biotheus Inc. (“Biotheus”). \n\n  * In October 2024, the first patient was dosed in a multi-site, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT06449222](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06449222)) to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of BNT327/PM8002 at two dose levels in combination with chemotherapy in the first- and second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced/metastatic triple negative breast cancer (“TNBC”). These data will inform a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line TNBC that is expected to start in 2025.\n  * In September 2024, the first patient was dosed in a multi-site, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT06449209](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06449209)) to evaluate BNT327/PM8002 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with untreated extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (“ES-SCLC”), and in patients with SCLC that progressed after first- or second-line treatment. These data will inform a Phase 3 clinical trial in first-line SCLC that is expected to start in 2024.\n  * A Phase 2/3 clinical trial in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) is expected to start in 2024.\n  * In June 2024, evaluation of BNT327/PM8002 in combination with BNT325/DB-1305, a Trophoblast Cell-Surface Antigen 2 (“TROP2”)-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) candidate, was initiated as part of an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05438329](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05438329)). The clinical trial evaluates the safety and tolerability of BNT325/DB-1305 alone and in combination with BNT327/PM8002 in various solid tumor indications. Additional trials of novel BNT327/PM8002 combinations with proprietary ADCs are planned to start in 2024.\n  * In September 2024, data were presented from three clinical trials evaluating BNT327/PM8002 in patients with advanced TNBC, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (“EGFR”)-mutated NSCLC and renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) at the 2024 Congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”): \n    * Data from an ongoing open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05918133](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05918133)) evaluating BNT327/PM8002 in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC showed clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity regardless of PD-L1 status and a manageable safety profile with no new safety signals observed beyond those typically described for anti-PD-(L)1 therapies, anti-VEGF therapies, and chemotherapy.\n    * Data from a Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT05756972](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05756972)) evaluating BNT327/PM8002 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC who progressed after EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment showed encouraging anti-tumor activity regardless of PD-L1 status and a generally manageable safety profile. \n    * Data from an open-label multi-cohort Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05918445](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05918445)) evaluating BNT327/PM8002 monotherapy showed encouraging anti-tumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with previously untreated advanced non clear cell RCC or treated advanced clear cell RCC.\n  * Data in first-line TNBC are planned to be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, taking place from December 10 to December 13 in San Antonio, Texas, U.S. Additional data are expected to be presented in 2025.\n\n\n\n**BNT316/ONC-392 (gotistobart)** is an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (“CTLA-4”) monoclonal antibody candidate being developed in collaboration with OncoC4, Inc. (“OncoC4”).\n\n  * In October 2024, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 trial (PRESERVE-003; [NCT05671510](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05671510)) due to varying results between patient populations. The trial assesses the efficacy and safety of BNT316/ONC-392 as monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC that progressed under previous PD-(L)1-inhibitor treatment. Enrollment of new patients has been paused while patients already enrolled in the trial will continue to receive treatment. Trials evaluating BNT316/ONC-392 in other indications remain unaffected.\n  * In September 2024, preliminary data from the Phase 2 (PRESERVE-004; [NCT05446298](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05446298)) clinical trial evaluating BNT316/ONC-392 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were presented at ESMO. The data suggest encouraging preliminary clinical activity and a manageable tolerability profile with no new safety signals detected for the combination.\n\n\n\n _mRNA Cancer Vaccine_ _Programs_\n\nBNT111, BNT113 and autogene cevumeran (BNT122/RO7198457 _)_ are investigational vaccines for the treatment of cancer based on BioNTech’s systemically administered uridine mRNA-lipoplex technology. \n\n**BNT111** is based on BioNTech’s wholly owned, off-the-shelf FixVac platform, and encodes shared melanoma associated antigens. \n\n  * A randomized Phase 2 clinical trial (BNT111-01; [NCT04526899](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04526899)) is being conducted in collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Regeneron”) to evaluate BNT111 in combination with cemiplimab in patients with anti-PD-(L)1 refractory/relapsed, unresectable stage III or IV melanoma. \n  * In July 2024, BioNTech announced that the trial met its primary efficacy outcome measure, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall response rate (“ORR”) in patients treated with BNT111 in combination with cemiplimab, as compared to an historical control in this indication and treatment setting. The ORR in the cemiplimab monotherapy arm was in line with the historical control of anti-PD-(L)1 or anti-CTLA-4 treatments in this patient group. The treatment was generally well tolerated and the safety profile of BNT111 in combination with cemiplimab in this trial was consistent with previous clinical trials assessing BNT111 in combination with anti-PD-(L)1-containing treatments. The Phase 2 trial will continue as planned to further assess the secondary endpoints which were not mature at the time of the primary analysis.\n  * BioNTech plans to present data from this trial at an upcoming medical conference in 2025. \n\n\n\n**BNT113** is based on BioNTech’s FixVac platform encoding Human Papilloma Virus 16 (“HPV16”) antigens.\n\n  * A global, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial (AHEAD-MERIT; [NCT04534205](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04534205)) is being conducted to evaluate BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic, PD-L1+, HPV16+ head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. \n  * In September 2024, an exploratory analysis of antitumor activity (15 patients) and immunogenicity (3 patients) from the safety run-in of AHEAD-MERIT was presented at ESMO. The data support the tolerability of BNT113 and clinical activity in combination with pembrolizumab was observed. In addition, BNT113 was found to induce _de novo_ T-cell responses against HPV16 antigens. \n  * Also at ESMO, results were presented from an investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 dose escalation clinical trial (HARE-40; [NCT03418480](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03418480)) evaluating BNT113 alone in the post-adjuvant and metastatic settings in patients with HPV16+ head and neck and other cancers. BNT113 was shown to induce immune responses in patients in the adjuvant and end-stage clinical settings and to be overall well tolerated with a manageable safety profile. \n\n\n\n**Autogene cevumeran (BNT122/RO7198457)** is an mRNA cancer vaccine candidate for individualized neoantigen-specific immunotherapy (“iNeST”) being developed in collaboration with Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”), a member of the Roche Group (“Roche”). \n\n  * A randomized, double-blind, multi-site Phase 2 clinical trial (IMCODE-004; [NCT06534983](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06534983)) evaluating autogene cevumeran as an adjuvant treatment with nivolumab in patients with high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial cancer (“MIUC”) is enrolling patients. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of autogene cevumeran in combination with nivolumab compared to nivolumab alone in approximately 360 patients. The primary endpoint for the study is investigator-assessed disease-free survival (“DFS”). Secondary objectives include overall survival (“OS”) and safety.\n  * Autogene cevumeran is also being evaluated in ongoing Phase 2 trials in adjuvant resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDAC”) ([NCT05968326](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05968326)), adjuvant colorectal cancer (“CRC”) ([NCT04486378](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04486378)) and first-line advanced melanoma ([NCT03815058](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03815058)).\n  * BioNTech plans to disclose interim data from the Phase 2 clinical trial ([NCT04486378](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04486378)) in stage II (high-risk) and III circulating tumor DNA+ (“ctDNA”) adjuvant CRC, which is projected for late 2025 or 2026.\n\n\n\n_ADC Programs_\n\n**BNT323/DB-1303** **(trastuzumab pamirtecan)** is an ADC candidate targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 (“HER2”) that is being developed in collaboration with Duality Biologics (Suzhou) Co. Ltd.

A potentially registrational cohort of patients with HER2-expressing (IHC3+, 2+, 1+ or ISH-positive) advanced/recurrent endometrial carcinoma has completed enrollment. Data from this cohort are expected in 2025.\n  * A confirmatory Phase 3 trial ([NCT06340568](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06340568)) in patients with advanced endometrial cancer is in planning.\n  * A pivotal Phase 3 trial (DYNASTY-Breast02; [NCT06018337](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06018337)) is being conducted in patients with Hormone Receptor-positive (“HR+”) and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer that progressed on hormone therapy and/or Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 (“CDK4/6”) inhibition. In September 2024, a Trial-in-Progress poster was presented at ESMO.\n  * Topline data from the ongoing Phase 3 trial in HR+ and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer that have progressed on hormone therapy and/or CDK4/6 inhibition are expected in 2026.\n\n\n\n**BNT324/DB-1311** is an ADC candidate targeting B7H3 that is being developed in collaboration with DualityBio. \n\n  * A first-in-human, open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial ([NCT05914116](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05914116)) in patients with advanced solid tumors is ongoing.\n  * In July 2024, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to BNT324/DB-1311 for the treatment of advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n  * The first preliminary data update from this trial is expected to be presented at the ESMO Asia Congress (December 6-8, 2024 in Singapore).\n\n\n\n**BNT326/YL202** is an ADC candidate targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor 3 (“HER3”) that is being developed in collaboration with MediLink Therapeutics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. (“MediLink”).\n\n  * A multi-site, international, open-label, first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial ([NCT05653752](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05653752?term=NCT05653752&rank=1)) sponsored by MediLink evaluating BNT326/YL202 as a later-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC or HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer is ongoing. On August 15, 2024, the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold that was placed on this trial, initially announced on June 17, 2024. Trial recruitment has been reinitiated with a focus on dose levels no higher than 3 mg/kg, where the safety profile was manageable and encouraging clinical activity was observed.\n\n\n\n_Cell Therapy Programs_\n\n**BNT211** consists of a chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”)-T cell product candidate targeting Claudin-6 (“CLDN6”)-positive solid tumors in combination with a CAR-T cell-amplifying RNA vaccine (“CARVac”) encoding CLDN6.\n\n  * A first-in-human, open-label, multi-site Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion basket trial ([NCT04503278](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04503278)) is being conducted to evaluate BNT211 in patients with CLDN6-positive relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including ovarian cancers and testicular germ cell tumors.\n  * In September 2024, data from the ongoing trial presented at ESMO showed signs of antitumor activity across indications. CARVac was shown to improve CAR-T persistence in some patients. The data also suggested that the safety profile of CLDN6 CAR T cells with and without CARVac is consistent with the previously published effects of CAR T therapies and that repeated CARVac administration does not significantly increase toxicity. \n  * A pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with testicular germ cell tumors is expected to start in 2025 based on encouraging activity observed in this patient group.\n\n\n\n**Corporate Update for the Third Quarter 2024 and Key Post Period-End Events**\n\n  * On October 1, 2024, BioNTech, alongside its artificial intelligence (“AI _”)_ subsidiary InstaDeep, presented an overview of its AI approach during an edition of the Company’s Innovation Series called AI Day.

We have maintained our leading position in the COVID-19 vaccine market which lays the foundation for establishing a sustainable respiratory vaccines business. In oncology, we have strengthened our core competencies by entering into several partnerships and have made numerous clinical advances. Today, our oncology pipeline encompasses multiple candidates in mid- and late-stage clinical development, including investigational ADCs, mRNA vaccines and innovative immunotherapies,” **s****aid Prof. Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-Founder of BioNTech**. “Our goal is to achieve product approvals in ten oncological indications by 2030 and with this improve the treatment options for patients around the globe.”\n\n**Financial Review for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results**\n\n_in millions €, except per share data_ |  **Fourth Quarter 2023** |  **Fourth Quarter 2022** |  **Full Year 2023** |  **Full Year 2022**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nTotal Revenues |  1,479.0 |  4,278.3 |  3,819.0 |  17,310.6  \nNet Profit |  457.9 |  2,278.7 |  930.3 |  9,434.4  \nDiluted Earnings per Share |  1.90 |  9.26 |  3.83 |  37.77  \n  \n**Total revenues** reported were €1,479.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to €4,278.3 million for the comparative prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, total revenues were €3,819.0 million, compared to €17,310.6 million for the comparative prior year period. Inventory write-downs by BioNTech's collaboration partner Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”) reduced BioNTech's revenues by €291.3 million and €906.7 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Cost of sales** were €179.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to €183.5 million for the comparative prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of sales were €599.8 million, compared to €2,995.0 million for the comparative prior year period. The change was mainly caused by the decrease in COVID-19 vaccine sales.\n\n**Research and development** (R&D) expenses were €577.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to €509.8 million for the comparative prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, research and development expenses were €1,783.1 million, compared to €1,537.0 million for the comparative prior year period. R&D expenses are mainly influenced by progressing clinical studies for pipeline candidates as well as by our newly acquired product candidates and the development of variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines. The increase was further driven by an increase in wages, benefits and social security expenses resulting from an increase in headcount.\n\n**General and administrative** (G&A) expenses reached €124.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to €119.9 million for the comparative prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, G&A expenses were €495.0 million, compared to €481.7 million for the comparative prior year period. G&A expenses were mainly influenced by increased expenses for IT services as well as by wages, benefits and social security expenses resulting from an increase in headcount.\n\n**Income taxes** were accrued in an amount of €205.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to €893.9 million accrued for the comparative prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, income taxes were accrued with an amount of €255.8 million, compared to €3,519.7 million accrued for the comparative prior year period. The derived annual effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023, was 21.6%.\n\n**Net profit** was €457.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to €2,278.7 million for the comparative prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net profit was €930.3 million, compared to €9,434.4 million net profit for the comparative prior year period.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents as well as security investments 2 **as of December 31, 2023, reached €17,653.4 million, comprising €11,663.7 million cash and cash equivalents and €5,989.0 million security investments, respectively.\n\n**Diluted earnings per share** was €1.90 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to diluted earnings per share of €9.26 for the comparative prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, diluted earnings per share were €3.83, compared to €37.77 diluted earnings per share for the comparative prior year period.\n\n**Shares outstanding** as of December 31, 2023, were 237,725,735, excluding 10,826,465 shares held in treasury.\n\nIn March 2023, the Management Board and Supervisory Board authorized the 2023 share repurchase program, under which BioNTech was permitted to purchase ADSs, each representing one ordinary share, with a value of up to $0.5 billion, which started June 2, 2023, and concluded on September 18, 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, 114,513 ADSs were repurchased under the share repurchase program at an average price of $112.22 (€105.07), for total consideration of $12.9 million (€12.0 million). For the year ended December 31, 2023, a total of 4,646,965 ADSs were repurchased related to the 2023 program at an average price of $107.58 (€98.24), for total consideration of $0.5 billion (€456.5 million).\n\n“In 2023, we strengthened our financial position while concurrently progressing our clinical pipeline of immunotherapies and executing acquisitions and collaborations. Looking ahead to 2024, we will maintain a prudent capital allocation strategy as we invest and execute in our maturing pipeline and prepare for our first potential oncology launches,” **said Jens Holstein, CFO of BioNTech**. “Our COVID-19 vaccine franchise is expected to remain an important cash contributor in 2024. We believe our solid financial position will enable us to push forward with our long-term strategy to develop novel therapies against cancer, infectious and other severe diseases thereby generating added value for patients, society, investors and the Company.”\n\n**Outlook for the 2024 Financial Year**\n\nThe Company's outlook contains the following components:\n\nTotal revenues for the 2024 financial year |  €2.5 billion - €3.1 billion  \n---|---  \n  \nBioNTech expects group revenue for the full 2024 financial year to be in the range of €2.5 - €3.1 billion. The range reflects certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, expectations regarding: the timing and grant of regulatory approvals and recommendations, COVID-19 vaccine uptake and price levels, inventory write-downs by BioNTech's collaboration partner Pfizer that would negatively influence the Company's revenues, seasonal variations in SARS-CoV-2 circulation and vaccination uptake which are expected to lead to demand peaks in the autumn and winter compared to other seasons, revenues from a pandemic preparedness contract with the German government as well as revenues from BioNTech Group service businesses, namely InstaDeep, JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH and in Idar-Oberstein at BioNTech Innovative Manufacturing Services GmbH. Generally, the Company continues to remain largely dependent on revenues generated in its collaboration partner’s territories in 2024.\n\n**_Planned 2024 Financial Year Expenses and Capex 3:_**\n\nR&D expenses4 |  €2.4 billion - €2.6 billion  \n---|---  \nSG&A expenses5 |  €700 million - €800 million  \nCapital expenditures for operating activities |  €400 million - €500 million  \n  \nBioNTech expects to continue to focus investments on R&D and scaling the business for commercial readiness in oncology, while continuing to be cost disciplined. Strategic capital allocation will continue to be an important driver of the Company's trajectory. As part of BioNTech's strategy, the Company may continue to evaluate appropriate corporate development opportunities with the aim of driving sustainable long-term growth and create future value.\n\nThe full audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, can be found in BioNTech’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the period ended December 31, 2023, filed today with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and available at <https://www.sec.gov/> (the “Annual Report”).\n\n**Endnotes**\n\n1 Calculated applying the average foreign exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2023, as published by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). 2 The contractual settlement of the gross profit share has a temporal offset of more than one calendar quarter.
