Based on a survey of more than 1,000 American consumers and businesses, the **[2024 WM Recycling Report](https://mediaroom.wm.com/image/WM-2024-Recycling-Report.pdf)** summarizes data and takeaways with respect to recycling behaviors and perceptions to better understand opportunities to bolster recycling education, investments and accessibility in the U.S.\n\n[ ![WM \\(WM.com\\) is North America's leading provider of comprehensive environmental solutions. WM has the largest disposal network and collection fleet in North America, is the largest recycler of post-consumer materials and is the leader in beneficial use of landfill gas, with a growing network of renewable natural gas plants and the most landfill gas-to-electricity plants in North America. \\(PRNewsfoto/Waste Management National Services, Inc\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1725541/Waste_Management_National_Services_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1725541/Waste_Management_National_Services_Logo.html)\n\n\"Recycling is essential to enabling the circular economy, but it works best when we work together,\" said **Tara Hemmer , chief sustainability officer, WM.** \"WM's research shows that many Americans are eager to recycle, but they need more education and greater access to recycling in order to build confidence in the practice. As the demand for recycled materials continues to grow, WM is driving solutions alongside our communities and customers by investing in technology that can make recycling more efficient, building new recycling facilities in areas that previously lacked access, and helping consumers and businesses understand what and how to recycle. Together, we can make a difference.\"\n\nThe report offers insight into education and access gaps as well as opportunities for greater collaboration. Key learnings from the survey include:\n\n  * **Many Americans want to recycle, but some lack an understanding of how recycling works and the positive impact it can have on the environment.** Many households across America have a high desire to recycle, with nearly half (44%) reporting that they are looking for ways to expand their recycling practices in the future. However, while 86% of people who recycle say they recycle plastic bottles and containers, 1 in 10 are not-at-all confident that their plastics are actually recycled. \n  * **Americans are likely more inclined to recycle when they have greater awareness, education and access.** Data showed 45% of respondents cite a lack of knowledge about what can and cannot be recycled as their biggest barrier, and 64% say if they knew more about what to recycle and how (and what not to recycle), their involvement would increase.\n  * **Where consumers live can have an outsized impact on their recycling habits.** Rural areas face greater accessibility issues – 50% of respondents in rural areas reported dealing with more inconveniences that led to lower rates of recycling, such as having to drive long distances or to a different site to recycle\n  * **Creating products with recycled content can be a differentiator for brands and potentially drive consumer purchase.** Data indicated 75% of surveyed Americans report that they are more likely to buy products from companies that include recycled content in their products. But as many as 60% of those same respondents report not having clarity on which brands use recycled content in their products, calling for additional education so that consumers have a better understanding.\n\n\n\nThe report, which comes ahead of America Recycles Day on Nov. 15, highlights the critical role recycling can play in advancing the circular economy by fueling the continuous reuse of materials. The findings emphasize that a robust recycling infrastructure relies on collaboration among consumer households, businesses, policymakers and local municipalities. WM is committed to advancing these efforts through its planned $1.4 billion investment to upgrade and build approximately 40 recycling facilities with advanced technology between 2022 and 2026.\n\nWM also works with customers of all sizes and other organizations to advance recycling education, including through its collaboration with the National League of Cities' [Recycle Right®](https://nlc100.org/recycle-right-pledge-to-take-action-in-your-city/) campaign, through its sustainability advisory services as the first [Official Sustainability Partner of Major League Baseball](https://www.mlb.com/news/wm-becomes-first-sustainability-focused-partner-of-mlb), and as the title sponsor of the [WM Phoenix Open](https://www.wm.com/us/en/inside-wm/phoenix-open), one of the largest certified zero-waste sporting event in the world.\n\nRead the [2024 WM Recycling Report here](https://mediaroom.wm.com/image/WM-2024-Recycling-Report.pdf).\n\n**2024 WM RECYCLING REPORT METHODOLOGY**[ The Futurum Group](https://futurumgroup.com/), a research and advisory firm, was commissioned by WM to conduct two online surveys of 1,045 consumers and businesses in July 2024 regarding recycling behaviors and perceptions. The consumer survey included 518 individuals over the age of 18 in the U.S., balanced to reflect U.S. census demographics. The business survey included 527 employees from companies across the U.S., including both recycling program service or contract decision makers within the company, employees responsible for managing recycling programs and general staff. Throughout the report, 'Americans,' and 'consumers,' 'residents,' 'individuals,' and 'households,' refer to consumer survey respondents, and 'business decision makers' and 'businesses' refers to business survey respondents.\n\n**ABOUT WM** WM (_[WM.com](http://www.wm.com/)_) is North America's leading provider of comprehensive environmental solutions.

This acquisition provides a complementary business platform in medical waste, a sector with attractive near- and long-term growth dynamics, and in secure information destruction services to further our leading suite of comprehensive waste and environmental solutions. Importantly, with its strong long-term business profile and our ability to enhance the projected financial outlook of the business through customer-centric growth and projected run-rate cost synergies exceeding $125 million, this acquisition positions us well to strengthen our operating EBITDA and cash flows.

(NASDAQ: SRCL). The previously announced purchase price of $62.00 per share in cash represents a total enterprise value of approximately $7.2 billion. Beginning on November 4, 2024, Stericycle stock will no longer be traded on the NASDAQ.\n\n“I am pleased to welcome the talented Stericycle team to WM,” said Jim Fish, president and chief executive officer, WM. “The completion of this acquisition advances our growth strategy, builds on our sustainability initiatives, and aligns with our long-term financial goals. This acquisition provides a complementary business platform in medical waste, a sector with attractive near- and long-term growth dynamics, and in secure information destruction services to further our leading suite of comprehensive waste and environmental solutions. Importantly, with its strong long-term business profile and our ability to enhance the projected financial outlook of the business through customer-centric growth and projected run-rate cost synergies exceeding $125 million, this acquisition positions us well to strengthen our operating EBITDA and cash flows. This achievement would not be possible without the dedication of our integration teams, which have been led by Rafa Carrasco, who will also lead our new WM Healthcare Solutions division comprised of the regulated medical waste and secure information destruction businesses.”\n\nAs part of WM, the regulated medical waste and secure information destruction businesses will benefit from a range of synergies, including leveraging WM’s expertise in logistics, technology-enabled cost optimization, and its leading waste disposal network, among others.\n\n“With today’s announcement, WM is well-positioned to win in the growing medical waste industry and deliver tailored and effective solutions in secure information destruction that further our sustainability leadership,” said Rafa Carrasco, senior vice president, enterprise strategy, WM, and president, WM Healthcare Solutions division. “We look forward to delivering on the compelling strategic and financial benefits of the combined business while protecting the health, safety and well-being of the communities we serve.”\n\n**ABOUT WM**\n\nWM ([WM.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wm.com%2F&esheet=54146232&newsitemid=20241101351997&lan=en-US&anchor=WM.com&index=1&md5=ed592527870105e366f882508547d372)) is North America's leading provider of comprehensive environmental solutions.

(NASDAQ: SRCL). The previously announced purchase price of $62.00 per share in cash represents a total enterprise value of approximately $7.2 billion. Beginning on November 4, 2024, Stericycle stock will no longer be traded on the NASDAQ.\n\n“I am pleased to welcome the talented Stericycle team to WM,” said Jim Fish, president and chief executive officer, WM. “The completion of this acquisition advances our growth strategy, builds on our sustainability initiatives, and aligns with our long-term financial goals. This acquisition provides a complementary business platform in medical waste, a sector with attractive near- and long-term growth dynamics, and in secure information destruction services to further our leading suite of comprehensive waste and environmental solutions. Importantly, with its strong long-term business profile and our ability to enhance the projected financial outlook of the business through customer-centric growth and projected run-rate cost synergies exceeding $125 million, this acquisition positions us well to strengthen our operating EBITDA and cash flows. This achievement would not be possible without the dedication of our integration teams, which have been led by Rafa Carrasco, who will also lead our new WM Healthcare Solutions division comprised of the regulated medical waste and secure information destruction businesses.”\n\nAs part of WM, the regulated medical waste and secure information destruction businesses will benefit from a range of synergies, including leveraging WM’s expertise in logistics, technology-enabled cost optimization, and its leading waste disposal network, among others.\n\n“With today’s announcement, WM is well-positioned to win in the growing medical waste industry and deliver tailored and effective solutions in secure information destruction that further our sustainability leadership,” said Rafa Carrasco, senior vice president, enterprise strategy, WM, and president, WM Healthcare Solutions division. “We look forward to delivering on the compelling strategic and financial benefits of the combined business while protecting the health, safety and well-being of the communities we serve.”\n\n**ABOUT WM**\n\nWM ([WM.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wm.com%2F&esheet=54146232&newsitemid=20241101351997&lan=en-US&anchor=WM.com&index=1&md5=ed592527870105e366f882508547d372)) is North America's leading provider of comprehensive environmental solutions.

This led to adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 11% and record margin of 30.5% for the quarter.”(a)\n\nFish continued, “Our strong results have been led by our Collection and Disposal business where our focused efforts on frontline retention, optimization of our cost structure, and providing differentiated service to our customers have fueled earnings growth. Additionally, we continue to make headway on our sustainability growth investments and planning for the successful integration of the Stericycle business. We have a lot of momentum for a strong finish to the year, which will position us to deliver another year of outsized growth in 2025.”(a)\n\n**KEY HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2024**\n\n  * Total Company revenue grew 7.9% driven by core price of 6.5%.(d) In addition to strong execution on pricing, revenue grew above expectations due to higher market prices for the recyclable commodities we sell and a notable increase in landfill volumes. The Company expects full year revenue growth to be about 6%, which is above the high end of prior guidance of 5.75%.(g)\n  * Adjusted operating EBITDA grew $170 million in the quarter driven by the Company’s Collection and Disposal business. Adjusted operating EBITDA margin grew 90 basis points to a record high of 30.5%. This strong result puts the Company on track to deliver about $6.5 billion in adjusted operating EBITDA in 2024, which is near the upper end of its guidance range.(a)(e)(g)\n  * The Company continues to prioritize technology and automation to optimize its cost structure and enhance operational efficiency. This is evident in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improving 70 basis points to 60.6% in the third quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter this measure has been below 61%.\n  * SG&A expenses were 9.4% of revenue, or 8.9% on an adjusted basis, reflecting continued discipline in cost control.(a)\n  * The Company completed eight recycling projects in the quarter and has now completed 24 out of its 39 planned automation and new market projects. Completed projects have added 1.5 million tons of annual recycling capacity across North America.(f)\n  * The Company has brought three of its 20 planned renewable natural gas projects into service, including one brought online earlier this year, and currently expects four additional projects to be commissioned by year-end. The Company anticipates that these seven projects will contribute approximately six million MMBtu of annual production next year.(f)\n  * Through the first nine months of the year, the Company generated $3.88 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, an increase of 16.2% from the prior year.\n  * The Company expects total capital expenditures to be $3.15 to $3.25 billion, with about $950 million targeted at sustainability growth investments.\n  * Strong operating cash flow growth combined with disciplined capital spending led to a 20.0% increase in free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. These results put the Company on track to achieve the high end of its guidance of $2.15 billion in free cash flow in 2024.(a)(g)\n  * The Company has invested $790 million on acquisitions in 2024, largely for solid waste businesses. The acquired businesses have contributed $108 million of revenue growth in 2024. Additionally, the Company continues to work through regulatory approval processes to support its planned acquisition of Stericycle. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. Integration planning processes are moving forward as expected.\n  * WM released its [2024 Sustainability Report](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsustainability.wm.com%2F&esheet=54143031&newsitemid=20241028909138&lan=en-US&anchor=2024+Sustainability+Report&index=1&md5=689101e22c81d69353740cf82cb5303d) during the third quarter, focused on three core ambitions - material is repurposed, energy is renewable, and communities are thriving. The report details the Company’s sustainability ambitions and progress toward its goals.\n\n\n\nFish concluded, “We came into this year expecting strong execution across several fronts, and through the first nine months we have delivered results that exceeded our own high expectations. As we look ahead to 2025, we anticipate continued growth in our solid waste business, increased contributions from our sustainability growth investments, and the successful integration of the Stericycle business to come together to create a significant step change in revenue, earnings, and free cash flow.”\n\n(a)| The information labeled as adjusted in this press release, as well as free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below and the reconciliations in the accompanying schedules for more information.  \n---|---  \n(b)| Management defines operating EBITDA as GAAP income from operations before depreciation and amortization; this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  \n(c)| For purposes of this press release, all references to “Net income” refer to the financial statement line item “Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.”  \n(d)| Core price is a performance metric used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of our pricing strategies; it is not derived from our financial statements and may not be comparable to measures presented by other companies. Core price is based on certain historical assumptions, which may differ from actual results, to allow for comparability between reporting periods and to reveal trends in results over time.  \n(e)| In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company updated its reportable segments to enhance transparency regarding its financial performance and underscore its commitment to sustainability through substantial planned and ongoing investments in its Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy businesses. The Company reports through four segments, referred to as (i) Collection and Disposal – East Tier; (ii) Collection and Disposal – West Tier; (iii) Recycling Processing and Sales and (iv) WM Renewable Energy. The Company’s East and West Tiers along with certain ancillary services not managed through its Tier segments form its “Collection and Disposal” business.  \n(f)| The Company’s blended average price received for single stream recycled commodity price sold during the quarter was about $101 per ton compared to about $58 per ton in the prior year period, and the full-year expectation for received pricing remains approximately $90 per ton. In the third quarter, the average price received for Renewable Fuel Standard credits sold during the quarter was $3.08 compared to $2.65 in the prior year period, and the average price received for natural gas sold during the quarter was $1.80 per MMBtu compared to $2.11 per MMBtu in the prior year period. The average price received for electricity was about $60 per megawatt hour in the third quarter compared to about $65 per megawatt hour in the prior year period.  \n(g)| The Company’s 2024 financial guidance and outlook excludes (i) transaction and advisory costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Stericycle and (ii) post-closing financial contributions related to the acquisition of Stericycle.  \n  \nThe Company will host a conference call at 10 a.m. ET on October 29, 2024 to discuss the third quarter 2024 results. Information contained within this press release will be referenced and should be considered in conjunction with the call.\n\nListeners can access a live audio webcast of the conference call by visiting [investors.wm.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.wm.com%2F&esheet=54143031&newsitemid=20241028909138&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.wm.com&index=2&md5=25fa5de94f40a9b6b1da63d1e6cf8c1f) and selecting “Events & Presentations” from the website menu.

You should view these statements with caution. They are based on the facts and circumstances known to the Company as of the date the statements are made.

Please also see the Company’s filings with the SEC, including Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, for additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to its business. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, including financial estimates and forecasts, whether as a result of future events, circumstances or developments or otherwise.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo supplement its financial information, the Company has presented, and/or may discuss on the conference call, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating EBITDA and margin, adjusted SG&A expenses and free cash flow. All of these items are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with (i) financial measures the Company uses in the management of its business and (ii) additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance and are not representative or indicative of its results of operations.\n\nIn addition, the Company’s projected adjusted operating EBITDA and margin is anticipated to be adjusted to exclude the effects of other events or circumstances that are not representative or indicative of the Company’s results of operations. Such excluded items are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures or litigation, and other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, the Company does not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of such projection to the comparable GAAP measure.\n\nThe Company discusses free cash flow and provides a projection of free cash flow because the Company believes that it is indicative of its ability to pay its quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay its debt obligations. The Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested); this definition may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nThe quantitative reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules, with the exception of projected adjusted operating EBITDA and margin. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

Our Company does not adjust for landfill accretion expenses when calculating operating EBITDA, while other companies do adjust it for the calculation of their EBITDA measure.  \nThe table below illustrates the impact that differing contract structures and treatment of accretion expense has on the Company’s adjusted operating EBITDA margin results.
