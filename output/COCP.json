Earlier this year, we received feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on a Pre-IND package that improves our clarity on the regulatory path and requirements for the late-stage influenza A clinical study we plan to conduct in the U.S.\n\n“The multiple-ascending dose portion in our Phase 1 pan-norovirus/pan-coronavirus study with oral protease inhibitor _CDI-988_ is underway and we are on track to report topline results in late 2024 or early 2025,” he added. “We view the development of an effective antiviral for norovirus as a significant opportunity for Cocrystal. There is no approved vaccine or antiviral for norovirus, which is highly contagious and the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis. In _in vitro_ studies, _CDI-988_ exhibited pan-viral activity against multiple norovirus strains, including the strain that is responsible for major outbreaks.”\n\n“Our significant clinical progress so far this year puts us on track for an active 2025,” said James Martin, CFO and co-CEO of Cocrystal. “I’m pleased to report that based on our currently projected expenditures and our cost-efficient business model, we expect our cash will be sufficient to fund the advancement of our planned development programs through the coming 12 months.”\n\n**Antiviral Product Pipeline Overview**\n\nWe apply our proprietary structure-based drug discovery platform technology for developing broad-spectrum antivirals that inhibit viral replication. By designing and selecting antiviral drug candidates that target the highly conserved regions of the viral enzymes, we seek to develop drugs that are effective against the virus and mutations of the virus, and also reduce off-target interactions that may cause undesirable side effects. Our drug discovery process differs from traditional, empirical medicinal chemistry approaches that often require iterative high-throughput compound screening and lengthy hit-to-lead processes.\n\n_Influenza Programs_\n\nInfluenza is a major global health threat that may become more challenging to treat due to the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and resistance to approved influenza antivirals.

          "content": "November 13, 2024\nCocrystal Pharma Reports Third Quarter\n2024 Financial Results and Provides\nUpdates on its Antiviral Drug-Development\nPrograms\nBOTHELL, Wash., Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cocrystal Pharma, Inc.\n(Nasdaq: COCP) (“Cocrystal” or the “Company”) reports financial results for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, and provides updates on its antiviral product\npipeline, upcoming milestones and business activities.\n“The coming months are critically important to Cocrystal as we expect to report topline\nresults from two ongoing clinical studies with our best-in-class antiviral candidates in major\nmedical indications,” said Sam Lee, Ph.D., President and co-CEO of Cocrystal. “In the\nPhase 2a influenza A challenge study with our oral PB2 inhibitor CC-42344, we expect to\nreport topline results before year end. Earlier this year, we received feedback from the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) on a Pre-IND package that improves our clarity on the\nregulatory path and requirements for the late-stage influenza A clinical study we plan to\nconduct in the U.S.\n“The multiple-ascending dose portion in our Phase 1 pan-norovirus/pan-coronavirus study\nwith oral protease inhibitor CDI-988 is underway and we are on track to report topline results\nin late 2024 or early 2025,” he added. “We view the development of an effective antiviral for\nnorovirus as a significant opportunity for Cocrystal. There is no approved vaccine or antiviral\nfor norovirus, which is highly contagious and the most common cause of acute\ngastroenteritis. In in vitro studies, CDI-988 exhibited pan-viral activity against multiple\nnorovirus strains, including the strain that is responsible for major outbreaks.”\n“Our significant clinical progress so far this year puts us on track for an active 2025,” said\nJames Martin, CFO and co-CEO of Cocrystal. “I’m pleased to report that based on our\ncurrently projected expenditures and our cost-efficient business model, we expect our cash\nwill be sufficient to fund the advancement of our planned development programs through the\ncoming 12 months.”\nAntiviral Product Pipeline Overview\nWe apply our proprietary structure-based drug discovery platform technology for developing\nbroad-spectrum antivirals that inhibit viral replication. By designing and selecting antiviral\ndrug candidates that target the highly conserved regions of the viral enzymes, we seek to\ndevelop drugs that are effective against the virus and mutations of the virus, and also reduce\noff-target interactions that may cause undesirable side effects. Our drug discovery process\ndiffers from traditional, empirical medicinal chemistry approaches that often require iterative\nhigh-throughput compound screening and lengthy hit-to-lead processes.\nInfluenza Programs\nInfluenza is a major global health threat that may become more challenging to treat due to\nthe emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and resistance to approved\ninfluenza antivirals. Each year there are approximately 1 billion cases of seasonal influenza\nworldwide, 3-5 million severe illnesses and up to 650,000 deaths. On average, about 8% of\nthe U.S. population contracts influenza each season. In addition to the health risk, influenza\nis responsible for an estimated $11.2 billion in direct and indirect costs in the U.S. annually.\nOral CC-42344 for the treatment of pandemic and seasonal Influenza A infections\nOur novel PB2 inhibitor CC-42344 showed excellent in vitro antiviral activity\nagainst pandemic and seasonal influenza A strains, as well as strains that are\nresistant to Tamiflu® and Xofluza®.\nIn December 2022 we reported favorable safety and tolerability results from the\noral CC-42344 Phase 1 study.\nIn December 2023 we began a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled\nPhase 2a human challenge study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, viral and\nclinical measurements of CC-42344 in influenza A-infected subjects in the United\nKingdom, following authorization from the UK Medicines and Healthcare\nProducts Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nIn May 2024 we completed enrollment in the Phase 2a human challenge study.\nIn June 2024 we reported that in vitro studies demonstrated CC-42344 inhibits\nthe activity of the new highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) PB2 protein\nrecently identified in humans exposed to infected dairy cows.\nWe expect to report topline results from the Phase 2a human challenge study by\nyearend and plan to file an IND application in 2025 to conduct a late-stage study\nin the U.S.\nInhaled CC-42344 for the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of pandemic and\nseasonal Influenza A infections\nOur preclinical testing showed superior pulmonary pharmacology with CC-42344\nincluding high exposure to drug and a long half-life.\nWe completed CC-42344 inhalation formulation development.\nWe initiated GLP toxicology studies.\nInfluenza A/B Program\nOur work to develop a preclinical lead of novel influenza replication inhibitors is\nunderway.\nNorovirus Program\nNorovirus is a highly contagious infection and is the most common cause of acute\ngastroenteritis. Worldwide, norovirus causes about one out of five cases of acute\ngastroenteritis that leads to diarrhea and vomiting. An estimated 685 million cases and an\nestimated 50,000 child deaths are attributed to norovirus each year worldwide, with an\nestimated societal cost of $60 billion. By targeting viral replication, we believe it is possible to\ndevelop an effective treatment and/or short-term prophylactic for closed environments for all\ngenogroups of norovirus.\nOral pan-viral protease inhibitor CDI-988 for the treatment of norovirus and coronavirus\ninfections\nOur novel broad-spectrum protease inhibitor CDI-988 is being evaluated as a\npotential oral treatment for noroviruses and coronaviruses.\nCDI-988 has shown in vitro pan-viral activity against multiple norovirus strains,\nincluding the genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) norovirus strain that is responsible\nfor major norovirus outbreaks.\nIn May 2023 we announced approval of our application to the Australian\nregulatory agency for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1\nstudy to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral CDI-\n988 in healthy volunteers.\nIn August 2023 we announced our selection of CDI-988 as our lead for the oral\ntreatment for norovirus, in addition to coronavirus.\nIn September 2023 we began dosing subjects in a first-in-human study in healthy\nvolunteers with oral CDI-988.\nIn July 2024 we reported favorable safety and tolerability results from the single-\nascending dose cohort in the Phase 1 study.\nIn September 2024 we advanced CDI-988 into the multiple-ascending dose\ncohort of the Phase 1 study.\nWe expect to report topline results from the CDI-988 Phase 1 study in late 2024\nor early 2025.\nCOVID-19 and Other Coronavirus Programs\nBy targeting viral replication enzymes and proteases, we believe it is possible to develop\neffective treatments for all diseases caused by coronaviruses including COVID-19 and its\nvariants, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory\nSyndrome (MERS). CDI-988 showed potent in vitro pan-viral activity against common human\ncoronaviruses, rhinoviruses and respiratory enteroviruses, as well as against noroviruses.\nThe global COVID-19 therapeutics market is estimated to exceed $16 billion by the end of\n2031.\nOral pan-viral protease inhibitor CDI-988 for the treatment of coronaviruses and\nnoroviruses\nCDI-988 exhibited superior in vitro potency against SARS-CoV-2 and\ndemonstrated a favorable safety profile and PK properties.\nIn September 2023 we dosed the first subject in our dual pan-norovirus/pan-\ncoronavirus oral CDI-988 study, which is expected to serve as a Phase 1 study\nfor both indications.\nIn July 2024 we reported favorable safety and tolerability results from the single-\nascending dose cohort in the Phase 1 study.\nIn September 2024 we advanced CDI-988 into the multiple-ascending dose\ncohort of the Phase 1 study.\nWe expect to report topline results from the CDI-988 Phase 1 study in late 2024\nor early 2025.\nThird Quarter Financial Results\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $3.2 million,\ncompared with $4.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, with the decrease primarily due to\nlower clinical study expenses. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third\nquarters of 2024 and 2023 remained relatively stable at $1.8 million.\nThe net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.9 million, or $0.49 per share, compared\nwith a net loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $4.2 million, or $0.41 per share, that included a\n$1.6 million payment to the Company in 2023 for a legal settlement.\nNine Month Financial Results\nR&D expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were $10.5 million, compared with $10.9\nmillion for the first nine months of 2023. G&A expenses for the first nine months of 2024\nwere $4.1 million, compared with $4.6 million for the first nine months of 2023.\nThe net loss for the first nine months of 2024 was $14.2 million, or $1.40 per share,\ncompared with a net loss for the first nine months of 2023 of $13.5 million, or $1.43 per\nshare.\nCocrystal reported unrestricted cash as of September 30, 2024 of $13.0 million, compared\nwith $26.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the first\nnine months of 2024 was $13.3 million, compared with $11.3 million for the first nine months\nof 2023. The Company had working capital of $12.3 million and 10.2 million common shares\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024.\nAbout Cocrystal Pharma, Inc.\nCocrystal Pharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company discovering and\ndeveloping novel antiviral therapeutics that target the replication process of influenza\nviruses, coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2), noroviruses and hepatitis C viruses.\nCocrystal employs unique structure-based technologies and Nobel Prize-winning expertise\nto create first- and best-in-class antiviral drugs.

Organization and Business\nCocrystal Pharma, Inc. (“we”, the “Company” or “Cocrystal”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company incorporated in Delaware, has been developing novel technologies\nand approaches to create first-in-class or best-in-class antiviral drug candidates. Our focus is to pursue the development and commercialization of broad-spectrum antiviral drug\ncandidates that will transform the treatment and prophylaxis of viral diseases in humans. By concentrating our research and development efforts on viral replication inhibitors,\nwe plan to leverage our infrastructure and expertise in these areas.\nThe Company’s activities since inception have principally consisted of acquiring product and technology rights, raising capital, and performing research and development.\nSuccessful completion of the Company’s development programs, obtaining regulatory approvals of its products and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations is\ndependent on future events, including, among other things, its ability to access potential markets, secure financing, develop a customer base, attract, retain and motivate\nqualified personnel, and develop strategic alliances.\nLiquidity\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern,\nwhich contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net losses and negative operating cash\nflows since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of approximately $14,238,000 and used approximately $13,325,000 of\ncash in operating activities.\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and restricted cash of approximately $13,095,000. Restricted cash represents amounts pledged as collateral for financing\narrangements that are currently limited to the issuance of business credit cards. The restriction will end upon the conclusion of these financing arrangements. We believe that\nour current resources will be sufficient to fund our operations beyond the next 12 months. This estimate is based, in part, upon our currently projected expenditures.\nThe Company’s activities since inception have principally consisted of acquiring product and technology rights, raising capital, and performing research and development.\nSuccessful completion of the Company’s development programs, obtaining regulatory approvals of its products and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations is\ndependent on future events, including, among other things, its ability to access potential markets, secure financing, develop a customer base, attract, retain and motivate\nqualified personnel, and develop strategic alliances. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has primarily funded its operations through equity offerings.\nThe Company will need to continue obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. The Company can give no assurances that the additional\ncapital it is able to raise, if any, will be sufficient to meet its needs, or that any such financing will be obtainable on acceptable terms. Our future cash requirements, and the\ntiming of those requirements, will depend on a number of factors, including economic conditions, the approval and success of our products in development, the continued\nprogress of research and development of our product candidates, the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing,\nprosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing, our\nsuccess in developing markets for our product candidates and legal proceedings that may arise. We have historically not generated sustained positive cash flow and if we are not\nable to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs.\nIf the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations or substantially curtail its drug development activities. The Company expects to\ncontinue incurring substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations over the next several years during its pre-clinical and clinical development phases.\n2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”)\nfor interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). They do not\ninclude all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal\nrecurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results of operations for the entire fiscal year. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s annual\nreport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 28, 2024 (“Annual Report”).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Cocrystal Discovery, Inc., Cocrystal Pharma Australia\nPty Ltd. (“Cocrystal Australia”), RFS Pharma, LLC and Cocrystal Merger Sub, Inc. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nF-5\nSegments\nThe Company operates in only one segment. Management uses cash flows as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal\nreporting or decision-making.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformance with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that\nimpact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of equity awards and warrant\nliabilities, recoverability of deferred tax assets, estimated tax credit receivable and estimated useful lives of fixed assets. The Company bases estimates and assumptions on\nhistorical experience, when available, and on various factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on\nan ongoing basis, and its actual results may differ from estimates made under different assumptions or conditions.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash deposited in accounts held at two U.S. financial\ninstitutions, which may, at times, exceed federally insured limits of $250,000 for each institution where accounts are held. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our\nprimary operating accounts held approximately $13,020,000 and $26,353,000, respectively, and our restricted cash collateral account balance was $75,000 and $75,000 at a\ndifferent institution. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant risks thereof.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nThe Company and its subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as functional currency. Foreign currency transactions are initially measured and recorded in the functional currency using\nthe exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from settlement of foreign currency transactions are recognized in profit and loss.\nCocrystal Australia maintains its records in Australian dollars. The monetary assets and liabilities of Cocrystal Australia are remeasured into the functional currency using the\nclosing rate at the end of every reporting period. All nonmonetary assets and liabilities and related profit and loss accounts are remeasured into the functional currency using the\nhistorical exchange rates. Profit and loss accounts, other than those that are remeasured using the historical exchange rates, are remeasured into the functional currency using\nthe average exchange rate for the period. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the remeasurement into the functional currency is recognized in profit and loss.\nFair Value Measurements\nFASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and enhances disclosures about\nfair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the\nprincipal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to\nmeasure fair value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes a fair value hierarchy\nbased on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:\nLevel 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 — other significant observable inputs for the assets or liabilities through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.\nLevel 3 — significant unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use to price the assets or liabilities at the\nmeasurement date.\nF-6\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, tax receivable, other assets, and accounts payable and\naccrued expenses approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The carrying values of leases payable approximate their fair values due to the fact that the interest\nrates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company regularly reviews the carrying value and estimated lives of its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, to determine whether indicators of\nimpairment may exist which warrant adjustments to carrying values or estimated useful lives. The determinants used for this evaluation include management’s estimate of the\nasset’s ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods as well as the strategic significance of the assets to the Company’s business\nobjective. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the asset’s fair value.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants and outside service providers, and other expenses relating to the acquisition, design, development\nand testing of the Company’s clinical products. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs are presented net of tax credits.\nThe Company’s Australian subsidiary is entitled to receive government assistance in the form of refundable and non-refundable research and development tax credits\n(“Refundable Tax Credits”) from the federal and provincial taxation authorities, based on qualifying expenditures incurred during the fiscal year. The Refundable Tax Credits\nare from the provincial taxation authorities and are not dependent on its ongoing tax status or tax position and accordingly are not considered part of income taxes. The\nCompany records Refundable Tax Credits as a reduction of research and development expenses when the Company can reasonably estimate the amounts and it is more likely\nthan not, they will be received. As of December 31, 2023, balance of Refundable Tax Credits was approximately $786,000, which was received in full as of September 30,\n2024. The Company estimated and accrued Refundable Tax Credits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately $652,000 and a tax payable of $15,000,\nresulting in a net balance of Refundable Tax Credits receivable of approximately $637,000.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between\nfinancial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to\nbe recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some\nportion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized based on the weight of available evidence, including expected future earnings. The Company recognizes an uncertain\ntax position in its financial statements when it concludes that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based solely on its technical merits. Only\nafter a tax position passes the first step of recognition will measurement be required. Under the measurement step, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit\nthat is more likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement. This is determined on a cumulative probability basis. The full impact of any change in recognition or\nmeasurement is reflected in the period in which such change occurs. The Company elects to accrue any interest or penalties related to income taxes as part of its income tax\nexpense.\nF-7\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company assessed its income tax expense based on its projected future taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2024 and therefore\nrecorded no amount for income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, the Company has significant deferred tax assets available to offset\nincome tax expense due to net operating loss carry forwards which are currently subject to a full valuation allowance based on the Company’s assessment of future taxable\nincome. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense using a fair value-based method for costs related to stock-based payments, including stock options. The fair value of options\nawarded to employees is measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period on a\nstraight-line basis.\nUse of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term, and a risk-free interest rate. The\nCompany estimates volatility using a blend of its own historical stock price volatility as well as that of market comparable entities since the Company’s common stock has\nlimited trading history and limited observable volatility of its own. The expected term of the options is estimated by using the SEC Staff Bulletin No. 107’s Simplified Method\nfor Estimate Expected Term. The risk-free interest rate is estimated using comparable published federal funds rates.\nNet Income (Loss) per Share\nThe Company accounts for and discloses net income (loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic income (loss) per common\nshare is computed by dividing income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per\ncommon share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares that would have been\noutstanding during the period assuming the issuance of common stock for all potential dilutive common shares outstanding. Potential common shares consist of shares issuable\nupon the exercise of stock options and warrants and the conversion of convertible notes payable.\nThe following table sets forth the number of potential common shares excluded from the calculations of net loss per diluted share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive\n(in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nOutstanding options to purchase common stock 555 559\nRestricted stock units for common stock 256 -\nWarrants to purchase common stock - 13\nTotal 811 572\nF-8\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAuthoritative guidance issued by the FASB (including technical corrections to the ASC), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not, or are not\nexpected to, have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n3. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets (three to five years) using the straight-line method. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, property and equipment consists of (table in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLab equipment $ 1,765 $ 1,757\nFinance lease right-of-use lab equipment 162 162\nComputer and office equipment 155 155\nTotal property and equipment 2,082 2,074\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,901) (1,803)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 181 $ 271\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense were approximately $98,000 and $149,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which includes amortization\nexpense of $0 and $7,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to assets under finance lease. For additional finance leases information,\nrefer to Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies.\n4. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following (in thousands) as of:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccounts payable $ 859 $ 1,222\nAccrued compensation 185 109\nAccrued other expenses 611 1,691\nTotal accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 1,655 $ 3,022\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses contain unpaid general and administrative expenses and costs related to research and development that have been billed and estimated\nunbilled, respectively, as of period-end.\n5. Equity\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has authorized 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par\nvalue per share.\nOn June 27, 2024, the Company, following approval of the Company’s stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed an amendment to its Certificate of\nIncorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Amendment”) to decrease the number of shares of authorized capital stock of the Company from\n155,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 150,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, to 101,000,000 shares of capital stock\nconsisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Amendment became effective on June 27, 2024.\nThe Company had 10,174,000 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\nThe holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held.\nF-9\n6. Stock Based Awards\nEquity Incentive Plans\nThe Company adopted an equity incentive plan in 2015 (the “2015 Plan”) under which 833,333 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to employees, and\nnon-employee directors and consultants of the Company. Recipients of incentive stock options granted under the 2015 Plan shall be eligible to purchase shares of the\nCompany’s common stock at an exercise price equal to no less than the estimated fair market value of such stock on the date of grant. The maximum term of options granted\nunder the 2015 Plan is ten years. As of September 30, 2024, 22,000 shares remain available for future grants under the 2015 Plan.\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table presents information concerning common stock available for future issuance (in thousands) as of September 30, 2024:\nShares Available for Grant\nBalance at December 31, 2023 275\nRestricted Stock Units (RSU) Granted (256)\nCancelled or returned 3\nBalance at September 30, 2024 22\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes stock option transactions for the 2015 Plan, collectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands, except per share\namounts):\nWeighted\nTotal Average Aggregate\nOptions Exercise Intrinsic\nOutstanding Price Value\nBalance at December 31, 2023 558 $ 10.37 $ -\nExercised - - -\nGranted - - -\nCancelled (3) - -\nBalance at September 30, 2024 555 $ 10.40 $ -\nRestricted Stock Units\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company’s Compensation Committee approved the issuance of 256,000 restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards to non-employee directors, officers,\nconsultants and employees. The aggregate fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted was estimated to be $451,000 using the market price of the stock on the date of\nthe grant which is expensed using the straight-line method over the vesting period.\nTotal Weighted Aggregate\nOptions Average Intrinsic\nOutstanding Fair Value Value\nUnvested December 31, 2023 - $ - $ -\nGranted 256 - -\nForfeited - - -\nVested 92 1.76 -\nUnvested and expected to vest at September 30, 2024 164 $ 1.76 $ -\nF-10\nThe Company accounts for share-based awards to employees and nonemployee directors and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation—Stock\nCompensation., and under the recently issued guidance following FASB’s pronouncement, ASU 2018-07, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to\nNonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. Under ASC 718, and applicable updates adopted, share-based awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant and that fair\nvalue is recognized over the requisite service, or vesting, period. The Company values its equity awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and accounts for\nforfeitures when they occur. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, equity-based compensation expense recorded on vested options and RSU was\n$252,000 and $557,000 and $173,000 and $643,000 respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was approximately $321,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options that is expected to be recognized\nover a weighted average period of 0.8 years. For options granted and outstanding, there were 555,000 options outstanding which were fully vested or expected to vest, with an\naggregate intrinsic value of $0.00, a weighted average exercise price of $10.40 and weighted average remaining contractual term of 7.47 years at September 30, 2024. For\nvested and exercisable options, outstanding shares totaled 435,000, with an aggregate intrinsic value of $0.00. These options had a weighted average exercise price of $12,38\nper share and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 7.16 years at September 30, 2024.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable options at September 30, 2024 was calculated based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock as\nreported on The Nasdaq Capital Market on September 30, 2024 of $1.76 per share less the exercise price of the options. The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the\npositive difference between the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock and the exercise price of the underlying options.\nF-11\n7. Licenses and Collaborations\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Merck Sharp & Dohme\nLLC (“Merck”) to discover and develop certain proprietary influenza A/B antiviral agents. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Merck funded research and\ndevelopment for the program, including clinical development, and was responsible for worldwide commercialization of any products derived from the collaboration. Under the\nCollaboration Agreement Cocrystal was eligible to receive payments related to designated development, regulatory and sales milestones with the potential to earn up to\n$156,000,000, as well as royalties on product sales. The Collaboration Agreement provided that Merck may terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time prior to the first\ncommercial sale of the first product developed under the Collaboration Agreement, in its sole discretion, without cause.\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company received written notice from Merck of Merck’s election to terminate the Collaboration Agreement. The termination of the Collaboration\nAgreement took effect on March 14, 2024. According to Merck’s termination notice, Merck determined there were no existing conditions to continue the collaboration. The\ntermination resulted from the inability to develop the compounds to meet a specific aspect of Merck’s program. The pending patent applications on compounds covered by the\nCollaboration Agreement and previously filed by Merck on behalf of both companies remain in place.\nKansas State University Research Foundation\nCocrystal entered into two License Agreement with Kansas State University Research Foundation (the “Foundation”) on February 18, 2020 to further develop certain\nproprietary broad-spectrum antiviral compounds for the treatment of norovirus and coronavirus infections.\nOn February 28, 2024, the Company provided notice to the Foundation of the Company’s election to terminate the 2020 License Agreements. The terminations, which were\nmade due to the Company’s determination that further development efforts under the License Agreements would be futile, took effect on March 29, 2024.\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into non-cancellable leases to purchase equipment and for its facilities, including related party leases (see Note 9 –\nTransactions with Related Parties). Leases are accounted for as operating leases or finance leases, in accordance with ASC 842, Leases.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases office space in Miami, Florida and research and development laboratory space in Bothell, Washington under operating leases that expire on September 30,\n2027 and January 31, 2031, respectively. For operating leases, the weighted average discount rate is 6.4% and the weighted average remaining lease term is 5.5 years.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s maturities of operating lease liabilities, by year and in aggregate, as of September 30, 2024 (table in thousands):\n2024 (excluding the nine months ended September 30, 2024) $ 99\n2025 407\n2026 419\n2027 415\n2028 376\n2029 and Thereafter 513\nTotal operating lease payments 2,229\nLess: present value discount (354)\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 1,875\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total operating lease liability of $293,000 is classified as a current operating lease liability.\nF-12\nThe operating lease liabilities summarized above do not include variable common area maintenance (the “CAM”) charges, which are contractual liabilities under the\nCompany’s Bothell, Washington lease. CAM charges for the Bothell, Washington facility is calculated annually based on actual common expenses for the building incurred by\nthe lessor and proportionately billed to tenants based on leased square footage. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately $134,000 and $76,000\nof CAM was included in general and administrative operating expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, respectively.\nThe minimum lease payments above include the amounts that would be paid if the Company maintains its Bothell lease for the five-year term, starting February 2024.\nOn September 21, 2023, the Company amended the lease agreement with a North Creek Tec LLC, to expand its laboratory facility in Bothell – WA, with additional 6,000 sq ft\nfor a period of 5 years that expires on January 31, 2029, with monthly lease payments under this lease totaling $660,000. In addition, the Company amended the lease\nagreement to extend the original laboratory facility for an additional 7 years with monthly lease payments under this lease totaling $1,498,000. Through January 2031, the\nminimum lease payment combined totals approximately $380,000 annually.\nOn August 14, 2024, the Company entered into a three-year lease extension with a limited liability company controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a director and a principal\nstockholder of the Company. On an annualized basis, straight-line rent expense is approximately $64,000 including fixed and estimable fees and taxes.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating lease expense, excluding short-term leases, finance leases and CAM charges, totaled approximately\n$291,000 and $175,000, respectively, of which $46,000 and $47,000 for each period was to a related party.\nPhase 2a Clinical Trial\nOn August 3, 2022 the Company engaged hVIVO, a subsidiary of London-based Open Orphan plc (AIM: ORPH), a rapidly growing specialist contract research organization\n(“CRO”), to conduct a Phase 2a clinical trial with the Company’s novel, broad-spectrum, orally administered antiviral influenza candidate. The Company prepaid a reservation\nfee of $1.7 million upon execution of the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company expensed $1.7 million leaving no balance in prepaid expenses. In addition, the\nCompany incurred additional costs of $2.2 million on this agreement during the period ended September 30, 2024.\nThe total estimated cost of the agreement (including the reservation fee) is approximately $6.9 million.\nOn May 21, 2024, the Company entered into a new agreement with hVIVO, as a follow-on to CPI-CST-001 Influenza virus challenge study, in which potential resistance to\nCC-42344 antiviral compound will be genotypically characterized. The Company incurred $45,000 on this agreement for nine months ended September 30, 2024. The total\nestimated cost of this agreement is approximately $227,000.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is a party to, or otherwise involved in, legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. As of the date of this report, except as\ndescribed below, the Company is not aware of any proceedings, threatened or pending, against it which, if determined adversely, would have a material effect on its business,\nresults of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n9. Transactions with Related Parties\nOn April 4, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with two accredited investors (the “Purchasers”) whereby the Purchasers agreed to purchase a\ntotal of 2,030,458 shares of unregistered common stock at a price of $1.97 per share for a total purchase price of $4,000,000 in two equal $2,000,000 investments. The\nPurchasers were an entity controlled by a director and another investor who subsequently joined the Company’s Board of Directors.\nOn August 14, 2024, the Company entered a three-year lease extension with a limited liability company controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, a director and a principal stockholder of\nthe Company. On an annualized basis, straight-line rent expense is approximately $64,000 including fixed and estimable fees and taxes.\nF-13\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nCocrystal Pharma, Inc. (the “Company” or “Cocrystal”) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to discover and develop novel antiviral therapeutics as treatments for\nserious and/or chronic viral diseases. We employ unique structure-based technologies and Nobel Prize winning expertise to create first- and best-in-class antiviral drugs. These\ntechnologies are designed to efficiently deliver small molecule therapeutics that are safe, effective and convenient to administer. We have identified promising preclinical and\nclinical-stage antiviral compounds for unmet medical needs including influenza virus, coronavirus, norovirus and hepatitis C virus (“HCV”).\nResearch and Development Update\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company continued to focus its research and development efforts primarily in three areas.\nInfluenza Program\nWe have several candidates under development for the treatment of influenza infection. CC-42344, a novel PB2 inhibitor, was selected as a preclinical lead as an oral or inhaled\ntreatment of pandemic and seasonal influenza A. This candidate binds to a highly conserved PB2 site of influenza polymerase complex (PB1: PB2: PA) and exhibits a novel\nmechanism of action. CC-42344 showed excellent in vitro antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains and Tamiflu® and Xofluza® resistant\nstrains, and has favorable pharmacokinetic and drug resistance profiles. Oral CC-42344 is being evaluated in a Phase 2a human challenge study. In addition, the inhaled CC-\n42344 is being developed for the potential prophylactic treatment of pandemic and seasonal influenza infections. Dry powder inhalation development and toxicology studies\nhave been evaluated.\nWe received authorization from the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to conduct a Phase 2a human challenge study with oral\nCC-42344 as a potential treatment for pandemic and seasonal influenza A. This ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is evaluating the safety,\ntolerability, viral and clinical measurements of influenza A infection in subjects dosed with oral CC-42344 treatment. In May 2024 we announced completion of enrollment of\n77 subjects.\nIn June 2024 we reported the potential efficacy of CC-42344 against the new Texas avian flu strain from in vitro studies with the recently published genome sequence for\nH5N1. Using our proprietary structure-based platform technology, the Company reported a high-resolution cocrystal structure of this avian PB2 protein complexed with CC-\n42344 and confirmed that CC-42344 binds to its highly conserved PB2 region. The in vitro data using purified Texas avian H5N1 PB2 protein further showed in vitro affinity of\nCC-42344similar to that of the previously data using pandemic avian and seasonal influenza A PB proteins. We also continue developing novel broad-spectrum influenza\nantivirals targeting replication enzymes of seasonal and pandemic influenza A and B strains.\n3\nNorovirus and Coronavirus Programs\nWe developed the novel protease inhibitor CDI-988 as an oral pan-viral treatment of noroviruses and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. CDI-988 was\nspecifically designed and developed using our proprietary structure-based drug discovery platform technology as a broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitor to a highly conserved\nregion in the active site of noroviruses, coronaviruses and other 3CL viral proteases. We believe CDI-988 represents a first-in-class pan-viral antiviral for the treatment of viral\ngastroenteritis and COVID-19 caused by noroviruses and coronaviruses, respectively.\nOral CDI-988 is being clinically evaluated for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics including a food-effect cohort in healthy volunteers in a single-center, randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study being conducted in Australia.\nWe previously announced favorable safety and tolerability results from the single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts of the Phase 1 study with CDI-988 in July 2024. Study\nparticipants in the SAD cohorts received CDI-988 in doses ranging from 100 mg to 600 mg. All participants completed the study with no discontinuations. There were no\nserious adverse events or severe treatment-emergent adverse events. No clinically significant observations were noted in laboratory assessments, physical exams or\nelectrocardiograms.\nIn September 2024 we initiated dosing of the first subjects in the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) portion of the Phase 1 study with CDI-988.\nTherapeutic Targets\nInfluenza: A worldwide public health problem, including the potential for pandemic disease.\nInfluenza is a severe respiratory illness, caused primarily by influenza A or B virus. Influenza A viruses are the only influenza viruses known to cause influenza pandemics.\nEach year there are approximately 1 billion cases of seasonal influenza worldwide, with 3-5 million severe illnesses and up to 650,000 deaths, according to the World Health\nOrganization (“WHO”). On average about 8% of the U.S. population contracts influenza each season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”). In\naddition to the health risk, influenza is responsible for approximately $10.4 billion in direct medical costs in the U.S. annually, according to the National Institutes of Health\n(“NIH”).\nCurrently approved antiviral treatments for influenza are effective but burdened with significant viral resistance. Strains of influenza virus that are resistant to the approved\ntreatments oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®), zanamavir (Relenza®) and baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®) have appeared and in some cases are predominant. For example, the\npredominant strain of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic was resistant to oseltamivir. Oseltamivir inhibits influenza neuraminidase enzymes, which are not highly conserved\nbetween viral strains. According to the WHO, approximately 15% of the H1N1 isolates circulating worldwide were oseltamivir resistant. Also, treatment-emergent resistance to\nrecently approved baloxavir has been observed during clinical trials and the potential transmission of resistant influenza variants could significantly diminish baloxavir\neffectiveness.\nCoronavirus: COVID-19 continues to be a global pandemic fueled by an emergence of new strains.\nCOVID-19 is a global pandemic with approximately 777 million confirmed cases globally, including 7 million deaths, as of October 2024, according to data reported by the\nWHO.\nCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of RNA viruses that historically have been associated with illness ranging from mild symptoms similar to the common cold to more\nsevere respiratory disease. Infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a wide range of responses, from no symptoms to more severe disease that has\nincluded pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be within 14 days after exposure, with\nmost illness occurring within about five days after exposure. SARS-CoV-2, like other RNA viruses, is prone to mutate over time, resulting in the emergence of multiple\nvariants. Adaptive mutations in the viral genome can alter the virus’s pathogenic potential. Even a single amino acid exchange can drastically affect a virus’s ability to evade the\nimmune system and complicate the vaccine and antibody therapeutics development against the virus. Based on the recent epidemiological update by the WHO, five SARS-\nCoV-2 VOCs (variants of concern) have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic. Also, as demonstrated in the Delta, Omicron and other variants, some variations\nallow the virus to spread more easily and make it resistant to the treatments and vaccines.\n4\nOn October 22, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved the antiviral drug Veklury® (remdesivir) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring\nhospitalization. Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that inhibits viral replication and was previously evaluated in clinical trials for Ebola treatment in 2014. On May 25, 2023,\nthe FDA approved Paxlovid™ (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets, co-packaged for oral use) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high\nrisk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. For certain hospitalized adults with COVID-19, the FDA has also approved Olumiant®\n(baricitinib) and Actemra® (tocilizumab). In addition, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for several antibody and antiviral therapeutics, including and\nLagevrio™ (molnupiravir).\nWe continue pursuing the development of novel antiviral compounds for the treatment of coronavirus infections using our established proprietary drug discovery platform. By\ntargeting the viral replication enzymes and protease, we believe it is possible to develop an effective treatment for all coronavirus diseases including COVID-19, Severe Acute\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nNorovirus: A worldwide public health problem responsible for close to 90% of epidemic, non-bacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world with no effective\ntreatment.\nNorovirus is a very common and highly contagious virus that causes symptoms of acute gastroenteritis among people of all ages. Norovirus infection can be significantly more\nsevere and prolonged in specific risk groups including infants, children, the elderly and people with immunodeficiency. In immunosuppressed patients, chronic norovirus\ninfection can lead to a debilitating illness with extended periods of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea as well as\nfatigue, fever and dehydration. Norovirus outbreaks occur most commonly in semi-closed communities and have become notorious for their occurrence in hospitals, nursing\nhomes, childcare facilities, cruise ships, schools, disaster relief sites and military settings. In the U.S. alone, noroviruses are responsible for an estimated 21 million cases\nannually, including 109,000 hospitalizations, 465,000 emergency department visits and nearly 900 deaths, according to the CDC. The NIH estimates the annual burden to the\nUnited States at $10.6 billion. Noroviruses are responsible for up to 1.1 million hospitalizations and 218,000 deaths annually in children in the developing world.\nThere is currently no effective treatment or effective vaccine for norovirus, and the ability to curtail outbreaks is limited. We are developing a novel norovirus antiviral\ncandidate for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of norovirus infection that is currently in a Phase 1 clinical study. A few companies have been developing vaccines and\nare in stages of clinical testing, including Vaxart Pharmaceutical, Moderna, Hillevax, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical (China) and National\nVaccine and Serum Institute (China).\nBy targeting viral replication enzymes and a viral protease, we believe it is possible to develop an effective treatment for all genogroups of norovirus. Also, because of the\nsignificant unmet medical need and the possibility of chronic norovirus infection in immunocompromised individuals, new antiviral therapeutic and prophylactic approaches\nmay warrant an accelerated path to market. We are developing inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and protease of norovirus. These enzymes are essential to\nviral replication and are highly conserved between all noroviral genogroups. Therefore, an inhibitor of these enzymes might be an effective treatment or short-term prophylactic\nagent, when administered during a cruise or nursing home stay, for example. We have developed X-ray quality norovirus polymerase and protease crystals and have identified\npromising inhibitors. We are implementing our proprietary drug discovery platform technology and approaches that have proven successful in our other antiviral programs.\nHepatitis C: A large competitive market with opportunity for shorter treatment regimens.\nHCV is a highly competitive and changing market. Since 2014, several combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents (“DAAs”) have been approved for the treatment of HCV\ninfection. These include Harvoni® (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Viekira Pak™ (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Epclusa®\n(sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Zepatier™ (elbasvir/grazoprevir) 12 weeks of treatment and Mavyret® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) eight weeks of treatment. We\nbelieve the next improvements in HCV treatment will be ultra-short combination oral treatments of four to six weeks, which is the goal of our program.\n5\nWe anticipate a significant global HCV market opportunity that will persist through at least 2036, given the large prevalence of HCV infection worldwide. The 2024 World\nHealth Organization Global Hepatitis Report estimates that 50 million people worldwide have chronic HCV infections with about 1 million new infections occurring per year\nand an estimated 3.2 million adolescents and children with chronic HCV infection.\nWe are targeting the viral NS5B polymerase with a non-nucleoside inhibitor (“NNI”), which could be developed as part of an all-oral, pan-genotypic combination regimen. Our\nfocus is on developing what is now called ultrashort treatment regimens from four to six weeks in length. Combining CC-31244 with different classes of approved direct-acting\nantivirals (“DAAs”) has the potential to change the paradigm of treatment for HCV by shortening the duration of treatment. Combination strategies with approved drugs could\nallow us to expand CC-31244 into the HCV antiviral therapeutic area globally and could lead to a high and fast cure rate, to improved compliance, and to reduced treatment\nduration. To our knowledge no competing company has yet developed a short HCV treatment of less than 8 weeks with a high (>95%) sustained virologic response (SVR) at\nweek 12.\nCC-31244, an HCV NNI, is a potential best in class pan-genotypic inhibitor of NS5B polymerase for the treatment of HCV. We completed a randomized, double-blinded Phase\n1a/b study in healthy volunteers and HCV-infected subjects in Canada in September 2016, with favorable safety results. We completed a Phase 2a study in HCV genotype 1\nsubjects in the U.S. in 2017. HCV-infected subjects treated with CC-31244 had a rapid and marked decline in HCV RNA levels, and slow viral rebound after treatment. Results\nof this study suggest that CC-31244 could be an important component in a shortened duration all-oral HCV combination therapy. We have completed the Phase 2a final study\nreport as filed with the FDA. See “Item 1 – Business – Research and Development Update – Hepatitis C” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023 for more information.\nWe have been seeking a partner for further clinical development of CC-31244 since completing Phase 2a trials.\nResults of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of compensation-related costs for our employees dedicated to research and development activities and clinical trials, as\nwell as lab supplies, lab services, and facilities and equipment costs related to our research and development programs.\nTotal research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were $3,242,000 and $4,194,000, respectively. The decrease of $952,000\nwas primarily due to our Influenza CC-42344 product candidate moving out of Phase 2a clinical trial and the finalizing of the Phase 1 clinical trial of norovirus and coronavirus\ncandidate CDI-988.\nTotal research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $10,500,000 and $10,902,000, respectively. The decrease of $402,000\nwas primarily due to a decrease in preclinical trial costs of $1.7 million and manufacturing development costs of $1.2 million, partially offset with an increase of $2.5 million\nrelated to CC-42344 Phase 2a clinical study costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation-related costs for our employees dedicated to general and administrative activities, legal fees, audit and tax fees,\nconsultants and professional services, and general corporate expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were $1,800,000 and $1,849,000, respectively, remaining relatively stable\nbetween periods.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $4,148,000 and $4,591,000, respectively. The decrease of $443,000 was\nprimarily due to reduction of legal litigation fees, insurance cost and other general and administrative expenses.\n6\nLegal settlement\nThe Company paid $1.6 million into the registry of the court in 2022 that was expensed as legal settlement. Following a favorable appeal ruling, the Company received a refund\nof the $1.6 million from the registry of the court during the period ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest Income, Net\nInterest income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $111,000 and $320,000, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 was $482,000 and $460,000, respectively. The interest income was primarily earned on cash held in interest bearing bank accounts.\nForeign Exchange Loss\nIn 2022, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary in Australia, making it subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign exchange loss during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $ 72,000 and $87,000, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nNo income tax benefit or expense was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company’s effective income tax rate was 0.00% for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As a result of the Company’s cumulative losses, management has concluded that a full valuation allowance\nagainst the Company’s net deferred tax assets is appropriate.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the above factors, net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $ 4,939,000 and $14,238,000, respectively, compared with a net loss for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $4,165,000 and $13,520,000, respectively, as a result of developments related to our expenses described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet cash used in operating activities was $13,325,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash used in operating activities of $11,340,000 for the\nsame period in 2023. This increase was primarily related to period expenses of our Influenza A Phase 2a clinical trial and preparation for our anticipated Influenza A Phase 1\ninhaler administer medicine clinical trial and completion of our COVID-19 Phase 1 clinical trial.\nWe used $8,000 net cash for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with $59,000 net cash used for the same period in 2023. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 the level of investments decreased compared with September 30, 2023 due to comparative reduction in purchases of laboratory\nequipment in 2024.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $3,993,000 for\nthe same period in 2023.\nThe Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs. The Company had $13,020,000 unrestricted cash on September 30,\n2024. The Company believes it has sufficient cash to maintain planned operations for more than the next 12 months.\nWe have focused our efforts on research and development activities, including through collaborations with suitable partners. We have been profitable on a quarterly basis but\nhave never been profitable on an annual basis. We have no products approved for sale and have incurred operating losses and negative operating cash flows on an annual basis\nsince inception.\nThe Company’s interim consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going\nconcern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Historically, public and private equity offerings have\nbeen our principal source of liquidity.\n7\nThe Company is party to the At-The-Market Offering Agreement, dated July 1, 2020 (“ATM Agreement”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (“Wainwright”), pursuant to\nwhich the Company may issue and sell over time and from time to time, to or through Wainwright, up to $10,000,000 of shares of the Company’s common stock. There were\nno sales under the ATM Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs the Company continues to incur losses, achieving profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization of its product candidates, and\nachieving a level of revenues adequate to support the Company’s cost structure. The Company may never achieve profitability, and unless and until it does, the Company will\ncontinue to need to raise additional capital. Management intends to fund future operations through additional private or public equity offerings and through arrangements with\nstrategic partners or from other sources. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all, and any\nequity financing may be very dilutive to existing stockholders.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements,” as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”),\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nForward-looking statements include statements about our expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding our product development efforts, business, financial condition, results of\noperations, strategies or prospects, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.\nReaders are encouraged to review these disclosures in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in conjunction with the review of\nthis report.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as of the\nend of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal\ncontrols over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or\ndetect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n9\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, the Company is a party to, or otherwise involved in, legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. During the reporting period, there have been\nno material changes to the description of legal proceedings set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the year ended September 30, 2024.\nITEM 1.A RISK FACTORS\nNone.\nITEM 2.

No director of this Company shall be personally liable to the Company or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Nothing\nin this paragraph shall serve to eliminate or limit the liability of a director (a) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to this Company or its shareholders, (b) for acts or\nomissions not in good faith or which involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (d) for\nany transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended after approval by the shareholders of this\narticle to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Company shall be eliminated or\nlimited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.\nAny repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the shareholders of the Company shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Company\nexisting at the time of such repeal or modification.\n11. (a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding (except as provided in\nSection 11 (f)) whether civil, criminal or administrative, (a “Proceeding”), or is contacted by any governmental or regulatory body in connection with any investigation or\ninquiry (an “Investigation”), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or executive officer (as such term is utilized pursuant to interpretations under Section 16 of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (an “Indemnitee”), whether the basis of such Proceeding or\nInvestigation is alleged action in an official capacity or in any other capacity as set forth above shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent\nauthorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such\namendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,\nliability and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such\nIndemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to\nthe benefit of the Indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to\nbe paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an “Advancement of Expenses”); provided, however, that\nan Advancement of Expenses shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it\nshall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses\nunder this Section or otherwise (an “Undertaking”).\n(b) If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Section is not paid in full by the Company within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Company,\nexcept in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against\nthe Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit or in a suit brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of\nExpenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In\n(i) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an Advancement of\nExpenses) it shall be a defense that, and\n2\n(ii) any suit by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking the Company shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a\nfinal adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Company\n(including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of\nthe Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an\nactual determination by the Company (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard\nof conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right hereunder, or by the\nCompany to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified or to such\nAdvancement of Expenses under this Section or otherwise shall be on the Company.\n(c) The rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of Expenses conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person\nmay have or hereafter acquire under any statute, this certificate of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.\n(d) The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against\nsuch expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n(e) The Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of\nExpenses, to any employee or agent of the Company to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Section with respect to the indemnification and Advancement of Expenses of\ndirectors, and executive officers of the Company.\n(f) Notwithstanding the indemnification provided for by this Section 11, the Company’s bylaws, or any written agreement, such indemnity shall not include\nany Advancement of Expenses incurred by such Indemnitees relating to or arising from any Proceeding in which the Company asserts a direct claim against an Indemnitee, or\nan Indemnitee asserts a direct claim against the Company, whether such claim is termed a complaint, counterclaim, crossclaim, third-party complaint or otherwise. Following\nthe termination of any Proceeding referred to in this Section 11(f), the Company may provide indemnification in accordance with this Section 11, the Company’s bylaws, any\nwritten agreement or the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n12. This Certificate of Incorporation and the internal affairs of the Company shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its\nconflict of laws principles. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and\nexclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any\ndirector or officer (or affiliate of any of the foregoing) of the Company to the Company or the Company’s shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim arising under, in\nconnection with, and governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nI, THE UNDERSIGNED, being the incorporator hereinbefore named, for the purpose of forming a corporation pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, do\nmake this certificate, hereby declaring and certifying that this is my act and deed and the facts herein stated are true, and accordingly have hereunto set my hand this 21st day of\nNovember, 2014.\n/s/ Michael Harris\nMichael D.
