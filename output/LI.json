Additionally, our net income reached RMB2.8 billion and operating cash flow reached RMB11.0 billion in the third quarter. Building on our solid execution across the organization and strong profitability, we are poised to maintain a relentless pursuit of business growth and technological innovation, which will propel us forward on our journey to achieving our long-term vision.”\n\n** _Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2024_**\n\n**Revenues**\n\n  * **Total revenues** were RMB42.9 billion (US$6.1 billion) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 23.6% from RMB34.7 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 35.3% from RMB31.7 billion in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n  * **Vehicle sales** were RMB41.3 billion (US$5.9 billion) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 22.9% from RMB33.6 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 36.3% from RMB30.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in revenue from vehicle sales over the third quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to the increase in vehicle deliveries, partially offset by the lower average selling price mainly due to different product mix. \n\n  * **Other sales and services** were RMB1.6 billion (US$220.9 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 45.8% from RMB1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 14.1% from RMB1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in revenue from other sales and services over the third quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024 was mainly attributable to the increased provision of services and sales of accessories, which is in line with higher accumulated vehicle sales, and increased sales of embedded products and services offered together with vehicle sales, which is in line with higher vehicle deliveries.\n\n\n\n\n**Cost of Sales and Gross Margin**\n\n  * **Cost of sales** was RMB33.6 billion (US$4.8 billion) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 24.5% from RMB27.0 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 32.0% from RMB25.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in cost of sales over the third quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024 was mainly attributable to increase in vehicle deliveries, partially offset by the lower average cost of sales due to different product mix and cost reduction. \n\n  * **Gross profit** was RMB9.2 billion (US$1.3 billion) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 20.7% from RMB7.6 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 49.3% from RMB6.2 billion in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n  * **Vehicle margin** was 20.9% in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 21.2% in the third quarter of 2023 and 18.7% in the second quarter of 2024. The vehicle margin remained relatively stable over the third quarter of 2023. The increase in vehicle margin over the second quarter of 2024 was mainly due to cost reduction, partially offset by lower average selling price mainly due to different product mix. \n\n  * **Gross margin** was 21.5% in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 22.0% in the third quarter of 2023 and 19.5% in the second quarter of 2024. The gross margin remained relatively stable over the third quarter of 2023. The increase in gross margin over the second quarter of 2024 was mainly due to the increase in vehicle margin.\n\n\n\n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\n  * **Operating expenses** were RMB5.8 billion (US$825.4 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 9.2% from RMB5.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 1.5% from RMB5.7 billion in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n  * **Research and development expenses** were RMB2.6 billion (US$368.6 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing a decrease of 8.2% from RMB2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 14.6% from RMB3.0 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in research and development expenses over the third quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024 was mainly attributable to decreased design and development costs for new products and technologies, and decreased employee compensation. \n\n  * **Selling, general and administrative expenses** were RMB3.4 billion (US$478.7 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 32.1% from RMB2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 19.3% from RMB2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses over the third quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to increased employee compensation associated with the recognition of share-based compensation expenses regarding the chief executive officer’s performance-based awards in the third quarter of 2024 as the achievement of the related performance condition was deemed probable as well as the growth in the number of staff.\n\n\n\n\n**Income from Operations**\n\n  * **Income from operations** was RMB3.4 billion (US$489.2 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 46.7% from RMB2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 633.4% from RMB468.0 million in the second quarter of 2024. **Operating margin** was 8.0% in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 6.7% in the third quarter of 2023 and 1.5% in the second quarter of 2024. **Non-GAAP income from operations** was RMB4.5 billion (US$636.0 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 49.1% from RMB3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 412.9% from RMB870.1 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**Net Income and Net Earnings Per Share**\n\n  * **Net income** was RMB2.8 billion (US$401.9 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 0.3% from RMB2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 156.2% from RMB1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2024. **Non-GAAP net income** was RMB3.9 billion (US$548.8 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 11.1% from RMB3.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 156.2% from RMB1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n  * **Basic and diluted net earnings per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders** were RMB2.82 (US$0.40) and RMB2.66 (US$0.38) in the third quarter of 2024, respectively, compared with RMB2.86 and RMB2.67 in the third quarter of 2023, respectively, and RMB1.11 and RMB1.05 in the second quarter of 2024, respectively. **Non-GAAP basic and diluted net earnings per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders** were RMB3.85 (US$0.55) and RMB3.63 (US$0.52) in the third quarter of 2024, respectively, compared with RMB3.53 and RMB3.29 in the third quarter of 2023, respectively, and RMB1.51 and RMB1.42 in the second quarter of 2024, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n**Cash Position, Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow**\n\n  * **Cash position 7 **was RMB106.5 billion (US$15.2 billion) as of September 30, 2024. \n\n  * **Net cash provided by operating activities** was RMB11.0 billion (US$1.6 billion) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB14.5 billion net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter of 2023 and RMB429.4 million net cash used in operating activities in the second quarter of 2024. The change in net cash provided by operating activities over the third quarter of 2023 was mainly due to increased payment related to inventory purchase, partially offset by the increase in cash received from customers. The change in net cash provided by operating activities over the second quarter of 2024 was mainly due to the increase in cash received from customers as a result of the increase in vehicle deliveries. \n\n  * **Free cash flow** was RMB9.1 billion (US$1.3 billion) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB13.2 billion in the third quarter of 2023 and negative RMB1.9 billion in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**_Business Outlook_**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects:\n\n  * **Deliveries of vehicles** to be between 160,000 and 170,000 vehicles, representing a year-over-year increase of 21.4% to 29.0%. \n\n  * **Total revenues** to be between RMB43.2 billion (US$6.2 billion) and RMB45.9 billion (US$6.5 billion), representing a year-over-year increase of 3.5% to 10.0%.\n\n\n\n\nThis business outlook reflects the Company’s current and preliminary views on its business situation and market conditions, which are subject to change.\n\n**_Conference Call_**\n\nManagement will hold a conference call at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Thursday, October 31, 2024 (8:00 p.m. Beijing/Hong Kong Time on October 31, 2024) to discuss financial results and answer questions from investors and analysts.\n\nFor participants who wish to join the call, please complete online registration using the link provided below prior to the scheduled call start time.

By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nThe Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n**_Exchange Rate Information_**\n\nThis press release contains translations of certain Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.
