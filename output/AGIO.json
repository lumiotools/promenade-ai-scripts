(Nasdaq: AGIO), a leader in cellular metabolism and pyruvate kinase (PK) activation pioneering therapies for rare diseases, today reported business highlights and financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“We had a strong quarter, marked by several important advancements across our pipeline. We completed enrollment of our Phase 3 RISE UP study of mitapivat in sickle cell disease, on our way to sharing topline results in late 2025. Our Phase 2b study of tebapivat in lower-risk MDS was initiated, and we received orphan drug designation from the FDA to support the development of tebapivat in this indication,” said Brian Goff, chief executive officer of Agios. “Our cash position was further strengthened by the receipt of $1.1 billion in payments. This will allow us to maintain this great momentum and fuel our next phase of growth, building towards a franchise with multi-billion-dollar potential. We remain focused on progressing our promising clinical programs to address the critical needs of rare disease patients and look forward to sharing our progress in the coming months.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights**\n\n  * _PYRUKYND® Revenues:_ Generated $9.0 million in net revenue for the third quarter of 2024, a 4 percent increase from the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by increased patient demand. A total of 211 unique patients have completed prescription enrollment forms, representing an increase of 5 percent over the second quarter of 2024. A total of 127 patients are on PYRUKYND® therapy, inclusive of new prescriptions and continued therapy.\n  * _Sickle Cell Disease:_ Completed enrollment of the 52-week Phase 3 RISE UP study of mitapivat in sickle cell disease, with more than 200 patients enrolled worldwide, and topline data expected in late 2025.\n\n\n  * _Lower-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes:_\n    * Initiated patient enrollment in the Phase 2b study of tebapivat (AG-946).\n    * Granted Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA to tebapivat for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).\n  * Presented topline data from Agios’ Phase 3 ACTIVATE-KidsT trial of mitapivat in pediatric patients with PKD. \n    * Observed transfusion reduction response rates were higher in the mitapivat arm compared to placebo and were clinically meaningful despite not meeting prespecified statistical criterion for the primary endpoint; secondary endpoints of transfusion-free response and normal hemoglobin response were observed only in the mitapivat arm.\n    * Safety was consistent with the profile observed in adults with PK deficiency who are regularly transfused.\n  * Presented data from the Phase 3 ENERGIZE trial as an encore session at the 19th Annual Academy for Sickle Cell and Thalassemia (ASCAT) Conference.\n  * _Corporate Development:_\n    * The FDA approved Servier’s vorasidenib for the treatment of IDH-mutant diffuse glioma. As a result, Agios received a $200 million milestone payment from Servier and a $905 million payment from Royalty Pharma in connection with the purchase agreement announced in May 2024.\n    * Entered into a distribution agreement with NewBridge Pharmaceuticals to advance commercialization of PYRUKYND® in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. NewBridge, a leading specialty company headquartered in Dubai, will commercialize PYRUKYND® in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n**Key Upcoming Milestones & Priorities**\n\nAgios expects to achieve the following key milestones by the end of 2024:\n\n  * _Thalassemia:_ File sNDA for mitapivat in thalassemia based on the positive results from the Phase 3 ENERGIZE and ENERGIZE-T clinical trials.\n  * Present additional clinical data at the 66th Annual American Society of Hematology (ASH) Congress, taking place December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n_Revenue:_ Net product revenue from sales of PYRUKYND® for the third quarter of 2024 was $9.0 million, compared to $7.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n_Cost of Sales:_ Cost of sales for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.8 million.\n\n_Research and Development (R &D) Expenses:_ R&D expenses were $72.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $81.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the $17.5 million upfront payment associated with the license agreement with Alnylam, which was recorded in the prior year.\n\n_Selling, General and Administrative (SG &A) Expenses:_ SG&A expenses were $38.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $25.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to an increase in commercial-related activities as the company prepares for the potential approval of PYRUKYND® in thalassemia.\n\n_Net Income (Loss):_ Net income was $947.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of $91.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the milestone and royalty agreement income recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n_Cash Position and Guidance:_ Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, were $1.7 billion compared to $806.4 million as of December 31, 2023.

(Nasdaq: AGIO), a leader in cellular metabolism and pyruvate kinase (PK) activation pioneering therapies for rare diseases, today announced that enrollment is complete for the Phase 3 RISE UP study. This global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is evaluating the efficacy and safety of mitapivat, an oral, small molecule PK activator, in sickle cell disease patients who are 16 years of age or older. Agios expects to report topline results from this 52-week Phase 3 study in late 2025.\n\nSickle cell disease is an inherited, lifelong blood disorder caused by mutations in hemoglobin, the major protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. In sickle cell disease, red blood cells are sickle-shaped due to a gene mutation that affects the hemoglobin molecule. When red blood cells sickle, they do not bend or move easily and can block blood flow to the rest of the body, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia, pain, poor quality of life, organ damage and early mortality. In sickle cell disease there is an increased energy demand of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to support red blood cell function and increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentrations that increase the likelihood of red blood cell sickling. Mitapivat is designed to optimize the glycolytic pathway, which has a dual effect of increasing ATP levels and decreasing 2,3-DPG concentrations in red blood cells.\n\n“There is a critical need for novel regimens that elevate the standard of care for patients suffering from sickle cell disease, a burdensome and debilitating disease,” said Sarah Gheuens, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of R&D at Agios. “We sincerely thank the patients, study investigators and patient advocates for their instrumental support and partnership in helping us complete enrollment of the Phase 3 RISE UP study. With enrollment now complete, we look forward to completing the trial and sharing topline results with the community in late 2025.”\n\nThe Phase 3 RISE UP study enrolled more than 200 patients worldwide. The trial’s primary endpoints are hemoglobin response, defined as a ≥1.0 g/dL increase in average hemoglobin concentration from Week 24 through Week 52 compared with baseline, and annualized rate of sickle cell pain crises. These are important clinical endpoints in sickle cell disease because anemia and pain episodes are the hallmark symptoms of the disease that severely impact a patient’s quality of life.\n\nThe positive results from the double-blind period of the RISE UP Phase 2 study, which were [presented](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=slDcu4qSgVqMrfaR4BicfEf42zHmINmGEOcuBJ49gUtF-AmaBcesoTHK0_yQGybSS6PVQvWdZtiFIwTlw6ayF1p4AsqOBybKZ1Hr8ed1ibG01kJ5J2rDDG-ekC800pQqkEyVljqq3Wg9q7zUW_YWpH22VtYiYgMGck9IeDl_EzurcArAY4c3HjWx1bgF_AnhKSjU0dcUFiO3l1PCJh26eg==) at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition in December 2023, supported Agios’ further exploration of mitapivat’s risk-benefit profile in sickle cell disease in the Phase 3 study.\n\n**About Phase 2/3 RISE UP Study** The RISE UP Phase 2 and 3 studies are evaluating the efficacy and safety of mitapivat in sickle cell disease patients who are 16 years of age or older, have had between two and 10 sickle cell pain crises in the past 12 months, and have hemoglobin within the range of 5.5 to 10.5 g/dL during screening. The Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are conducted under a single operationally seamless Phase 2/3 protocol. The two studies enrolled different participants and achieved operational efficiency through leveraging the same sites, vendors and other resources.\n\nThe Phase 2 study included a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled period in which participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 50 mg mitapivat twice daily, 100 mg mitapivat twice daily or matched placebo. The primary endpoints were hemoglobin response, defined as ≥1.0 g/dL increase in average hemoglobin concentration from Week 10 through Week 12 compared to baseline, and safety.\n\nThe Phase 3 study includes a 52-week randomized, placebo-controlled period in which participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 100 mg of mitapivat twice daily or matched placebo. The primary endpoints are hemoglobin response, defined as a ≥1.0 g/dL increase in average hemoglobin concentration from Week 24 through Week 52 compared with baseline, and annualized rate of sickle cell pain crises.\n\nParticipants who complete the double-blind period of the Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies will have the option to move into a 216-week open-label extension period to receive mitapivat.\n\n**About PYRUKYND****®****(mitapivat)** PYRUKYND is a pyruvate kinase activator indicated for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency in the United States, and for the treatment of PK deficiency in adult patients in the European Union.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION****Acute Hemolysis:** Acute hemolysis with subsequent anemia has been observed following abrupt interruption or discontinuation of PYRUKYND in a dose-ranging study. Avoid abruptly discontinuing PYRUKYND. Gradually taper the dose of PYRUKYND to discontinue treatment if possible. When discontinuing treatment, monitor patients for signs of acute hemolysis and anemia including jaundice, scleral icterus, dark urine, dizziness, confusion, fatigue, or shortness of breath.\n\n**Adverse Reactions:** Serious adverse reactions occurred in 10% of patients receiving PYRUKYND in the ACTIVATE trial, including atrial fibrillation, gastroenteritis, rib fracture, and musculoskeletal pain, each of which occurred in 1 patient. In the ACTIVATE trial, the most common adverse reactions including laboratory abnormalities (≥10%) in patients with PK deficiency were estrone decreased (males), increased urate, back pain, estradiol decreased (males), and arthralgia.\n\n**Drug Interactions:**\n\n  * Strong CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers: Avoid concomitant use.\n  * Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Do not titrate PYRUKYND beyond 20 mg twice daily.\n  * Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Consider alternatives that are not moderate inducers. If there are no alternatives, adjust PYRUKYND dosage.\n  * Sensitive CYP3A, CYP2B6, CYP2C Substrates Including Hormonal Contraceptives: Avoid concomitant use with substrates that have narrow therapeutic index.\n  * UGT1A1 Substrates: Avoid concomitant use with substrates that have narrow therapeutic index.\n  * P-gp Substrates: Avoid concomitant use with substrates that have narrow therapeutic index.\n\n\n\n**Hepatic Impairment** : Avoid use of PYRUKYND in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.\n\n**Please see**[**full Prescribing Information**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=giJr4nh1KNiADb4p55S0pPHT6OM3jmey9NQSXuOAsxGO13d1g9FFSATdQ4tETcBGkOC_BEDkLo3dn2O495J5fmOW-7uAnCAnTogEQiW80qqZtPOk3ndRiXGQpp4H4AYfIDdH0PgT6N-tq_Lyw4HmSKTZkGhCucvFXiRO_-sG25BJ-2lRkPWFtVkHXu6Ge3GyWS9Ebr7ympQqJ4pPjZy2g_xxDwmem3-sHzVp21Abrq5kRxQHD3HcEpvHBA7gUn4YpvbWzqpHPc3FdTbaqNFlf9ot-fI7huaKWw3wUw4XgMfUrO5-TgejQrHmv11pGvAUkPpUTlhVr_KquAl29mVJtOby0uOEdajEBT1ZaHse_3bS_3rQNjlm8e8J2kHgDr_Wi97BVsaxS5TVpXlp6m0QhQ7nqClUHrvl7uwIlcYJBW6sEHiKyz2HNRa0hJrimqmZOS8I50zXrQr2WZM3x98bX4F-2oVcAh8gn2u43zN30KBASPAAgJyxGtzPrz2JLOC9Y_Xw5VvB2iCl8ddfeywyxU_X1BgZcI2e2mQ5us0z71qpRfsAbfflEbCPKuNJGUlOrWgi4ybAlAoU0cKsKPWIj1onjpZmL-UadEFZ5oqjd58=)**and**[**Summary of Product Characteristics**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YEZKWWCvV9cF1ohQD7IM1BOVt-Zyym8EZl4mvwz3KIy3HgCV3ycTBdta-PEuHpgexW9sMgm9EEhJ1acWiUR7JZbjnsogQPMHmvq8ZvDL4B5D_EPSuvUVnpHQU21EudTkwpzjyhigj_uxJS0uta-b068P-SrUHpb9uHXBjz3DJAgzOfQwE_9D0dSAoQFDoqwgxNSdx9cLZf-1F-Cvx_A23iOTEKIwUiJz5GvAbiDxsCatVSQ3zrYdrMP_As8CUECKRc0qMINY0HRos7zHbn-O8b0TvBuhs5sjOws3ZXD9_0a4-vTKtzC1U0xS_thHTiug3z0DH_TIYIs77qf-IfpnQ_pF_qs7RAppza5PGqB4qauurxulyAA-aiUyZ1s6kIYYhYwfRP1aDOKE-77svAhtk-6w_d2uC6ENcF9FAeCanr9HWxQs1dPC_YeolsHFQaaKPBaRtN-0-cRJPu4FpBfQGggQI8jWh2S4BWZaGJCmCCkCJucxts8oh7F8JlLukx3afJF9ZxA-actt6MewzDpIO6H-kycSq0yez36oV522Aj0dDe0v2bRyjyJEbAgxWZgfSW3QsNmAt6iSRfC1stTHziSX_V2V6pTQ5N1BEe4w2wMEKwYIvAYpHcdER2TOkzO71nRSgGlhMzlT-S4ihlfPgHGz-8d0DyISXTOXRvP5GluWWteDZZQ0b4HlPx3c947rT_VXO-jDYORHdxf6yqqQgBPEAY1Y6l_jrb9A_xenv1wrNUWTwoklG9eoCvAS9xyt6wpYHffged5a6B11E-gpNftXaQejKA_6yDiFs96H0_N-66WsoNLqL4sZyRjlcD0hcqN0dTMxmqJFMPwxCXNa5LiiIG4NXdIIgluiIMDX4kdfdW8czCPDxv8vV7rA6pE24p4MI7uAmbRl487ksyvebIMlewyoFnkxnwUWeP6IqjOHYvOf7BJNWqASdzh5sXyeH0ECaJspNAlkZIYjli7sTcqBugLQyka9HR2oGDECUoI=)**for PYRUKYND.**\n\n**About Agios** Agios is the pioneering leader in PK activation and is dedicated to developing and delivering transformative therapies for patients living with rare diseases.
