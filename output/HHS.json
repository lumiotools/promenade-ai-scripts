          "content": "Harte Hanks\nThe Customer Company\nJanuary 2023 NASDAQ: HHS\nDisclaimers\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe report and the other disclosure we make from time to time contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning ofU.S.federal securities laws. All such statements are qualified by this cautionary note, provided pursuant to the safe\nharbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements other than historical facts are forward-looking and may be identified by words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expects,\"\n\"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates,\" \"seeks,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements are based on current information, expectations and estimates and involve risks, uncertainties,\nassumptions and other factors that are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to vary materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements. In that event, our business, financial condition, results\nof operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected and investors in our securities could lose part or all of their investments. These risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors include: (a) local, national and international\neconomic and business conditions, including (i) the outbreak of diseases, such as the COVID-19 coronavirus and new variants thereof, which has curtailed travel to and from certain countries and geographic regions, created supply chain\ndisruption and shortages, disrupted business operations and reduced consumer spending, (ii) changesin market conditions and market volatility, including inflation, interest rates, the value of securities and other financial assets, and\nexchange rates that may adversely impact marketing expenditures; and (iii) the impact of economic environments and competitive pressures on the financial condition, marketing expenditures and activities of our clients and prospects; (b) the\ndemand for our products and services by clients and prospective clients, including (i) the willingness of existing clients tomaintain or increase their spending on products and services that are or remain profitable for us, and (ii) our ability to\npredict changes in client needs and preferences; (c) economic and other business factors that impact the industry verticals we serve, including competition and consolidation of current and prospective clients, vendors and partners in these\nverticals; (d) our ability to manage and timely adjust our facilities, capacity, workforce and cost structure to effectively serve our clients; (e) our ability to improve our processes and to provide new products and services in a timely and cost-\neffective manner though development, license, partnership or acquisition; (f) our ability to protect our facilities against security breaches and other interruptions and to protect sensitive personal information of our clients and their customers;\n(g) our ability to respond to increasing concern, regulation and legal action over consumer privacy issues, including changing requirements for collection, processing and use of information; (h) the impact of privacy and other regulations,\nincluding restrictions on unsolicited marketing communications and other consumer protection laws; (i) fluctuations in fuel prices, paper prices, postal rates and postal delivery schedules; (j) unanticipated developments regarding litigation or\nother contingent liabilities; (k) our ability to complete anticipated divestitures and reorganizations, including cost-saving initiatives; (l) our ability to realize the expected tax refunds; and (m) other factors discussed from time to time in our\nfilings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements herein are made only as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, even if new information\nbecomes available or other events occur in the future.\nSupplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). In this presentation, however, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance to provide investors with a better\nunderstanding of operating results and underlying trends to assess our performance and liquidity. We have presented in the appendix to this presentation a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure.\nWe present the non-GAAP financial measure \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as a supplemental measure of operating performance in order to provide an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. We define \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as\nearnings before interest expense net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation expense, restructuring expense, impairment expense, stock-based compensation expense, and other non-cash expenses. The most directly comparable measure\nfor Adjusted EBITDA is Net Income (Loss). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important performance metric because it facilitates the analysis of our results, exclusive of certain non-cash items, including items that do not directly correlate to\nour business operations; however, we urge investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP Net Income (Loss), which is included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial\nmeasure to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA does not serve as a substitute and should not be construed as a substitute for GAAP performance but provide supplemental information concerning our performance that our investors and we find useful. We evaluate our\noperating performance based on several measures, including these non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental financial measures of operating performance\nfor investors because they facilitate investors’ ability to evaluate the operational strength of the Company’s business. However, there are limitations to the use of these non-GAAP measures, including that they may not be calculated the\nsame by other companies in our industry limiting their use as a tool to compare results. Any supplemental non-GAAP financial measures referred to herein are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and they should not be considered in\nisolation or as substitutes for the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n2\nHarte Hanks:\nDiluted EPS\nPERFORMANCE\nThe Customer Company $1.27\n— FY 2021Revenueof$195 million\n$0.83\nHarte Hanks is a leading global customer experience $0.52 $0.39 $0.52 — FY 2021EBITDA of$10+ million\n$0.20\ncompany operating in three business segments ($0.28)\n— FY 2021 Net Income YoY increase $14+ million\nQ1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022\n— 6 quarters of positive EBITDA and Net Income\n2021 Segment Revenue — Strong Balance Sheet, 9/30/22cash$9+million\n$195 million\nNetCash\n— Repurchased preferred shares, Q4 22\n$6.9\n$6.2\n$4.7 $6.9 — Growing EBITDA margins\n$2.9\n— Pandemic revenue a catalystfor Customer Care\n$2.9\n-$2.2\nMarketing Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022\nFulfillment &\nLogistics Services $ Millions FOCUS\n29%\n33% — Shrink to grow and build for scale model\nRevenue — Asset light and profitable growth focus\n$52.0 $53.9 — Corecompetenciesand customer focus\n$49.3 $49.6 $49.1 $48.6\n$43.8\nCustomer Care — Long-term client relationships\n38%\n— Penetrating large and growing addressable markets\n— Investing in tech & talent to scale growth\nQ1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022\n$ Millions\n3\nWhat we do\nHHS is a global customer experience company focused on bringing companies closer to customers for nearly 100 years.\nWe provide our services to diverse industries including, but not limited to health care, pharma, financials, consumer products, technology,\nentertainment/streaming, and automotive.\nMarketing Services Customer Care Fulfillment and Logistics\nFocused on strategic planning, data-driven insights, Focused on delivering full-service customer care Focused on B2B product and literature fulfillment,\nperformance analytics, creative design, technology\nsolutions that are tech-enabled and people B2C e-commerce and sampling, and end-to-end\nenablement, and program execution to drive\ndriven supply chain and logistics services.\nbusiness outcomes and optimize customers’ ROI.\n4\nWhere we were: Where we are:\n2014-2018 2022\n— FY 2021 - $195MM Revenue and $10MM EBITDA\n— FY2018 - $285MM Revenue and negative $19 million EBITDA\n— Q3 2022 YTD - $151.5 MM Revenue and $13.4 MM EBITDA\n— Direct Mailer and Call Center with marketing capabilities\n— Leaner, optimized, and simplified business\n— Mis-steps and management turnover\n— Customer-focused solutions unique to Harte Hanks\n— Large infrastructure and high fixed costs\n— Investing in technology platform, talent, and tools to scale growth\n— Decentralized and siloed resources\n— Collaborating and cross-selling services\n— Weakening financial position\n— Acquiring InsideOut enhances Customer Care and Marketing Services\ncapabilities to accelerate our customers’ growth\n— YoY growth in revenue and significant growth in EBITDA\n— Strengthening balance sheet and enhancing shareholder value\n5\n*EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.
