While the cyclical correction continues in our global components business, we saw enterprise IT spending gain momentum,” said Sean Kerins, Arrow’s president and chief executive officer. “I am pleased that we delivered revenue above the midpoint of our guidance range and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share ahead of our expectations,” said Mr. Kerins. \n\nArrow Consolidated   \n---  \nQuarter Ended  |  Nine Months Ended   \nSeptember 28,  |  September 30,  |  September 28,  |  September 30,   \n**(in millions except per share data)** |  2024  |  2023  |  2024  |  2023   \nConsolidated sales  |  $  |  6,823  |  $  |  8,007  |  $  |  20,640  |  $  |  25,258   \nNet income attributable to shareholders  |  101  |  199  |  293  |  709   \nNet income per diluted share  |  1.88  |  3.53  |  5.42  |  12.28   \nNon-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders (1) |  128  |  233  |  410  |  757   \nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share  |  2.38  |  4.14  |  7.59  |  13.12   \n  \nIn the third quarter of 2024, sales decreased 15 percent year over year.

The company has identified opportunities to reduce annual operating expenses by the end of 2026 by approximately $90 million to $100 million, primarily related to reorganizing and consolidating certain areas of the company’s operations. \n\n_ 1 A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is presented in the reconciliation tables included herein. _  \n---  \n  \n** Fourth-Quarter 2024 Outlook **\n\n  * Consolidated sales of $6.67 billion to $7.27 billion, with global components sales of $4.50 billion to $4.90 billion, and global enterprise computing solutions sales of $2.17 billion to $2.37 billion \n  * Net income per share on a diluted basis of $1.35 to $1.55, and non-GAAP net income per share on a diluted basis of $2.48 to $2.68 \n  * Average tax rate in the range of 23 to 25 percent \n  * Interest expense of approximately $60 million to $65 million \n  * Changes in foreign currencies to increase sales by approximately $60 million, and earnings per share on a diluted basis by $0.02 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 \n  * Changes in foreign currencies to have no impact on growth in sales or earnings per share on a diluted basis compared to the third quarter of 2024 \n\n\n\nFourth-Quarter 2024 GAAP to non-GAAP Outlook Reconciliation   \n---  \nNON-GAAP SALES RECONCILIATION   \nQuarter Ended  |  Quarter Ended   \nDecember 31,  |  December 31,  |  December 31,  |  September 28,   \n**(in billions)** |  2024  |  2023  |  % Change  |  2024  |  2024  |  % Change   \nGlobal components sales, GAAP  |  $  |  4.50 - 4.90  |  $  |  5.64  |  (20%) - (13%)  |  $  |  4.50 - 4.90  |  $  |  4.95  |  (9%) - (1%)   \nImpact of changes in foreign currencies  |  —  |  0.04  |  —  |  —   \nGlobal components sales, constant currency  |  $  |  4.50 - 4.90  |  $  |  5.68  |  (21%) - (14%)  |  $  |  4.50 - 4.90  |  $  |  4.95  |  (9%) - (1%)   \nGlobal ECS sales, GAAP  |  $  |  2.17 - 2.37  |  $  |  2.21  |  (2%) - 7%  |  $  |  2.17 - 2.37  |  $  |  1.88  |  15% - 26%   \nImpact of changes in foreign currencies  |  —  |  0.02  |  —  |  —   \nGlobal ECS sales, constant currency  |  $  |  2.17 - 2.37  |  $  |  2.23  |  (3%) - 6%  |  $  |  2.17 - 2.37  |  $  |  1.88  |  15% - 26%   \n  \nNON-GAAP EARNINGS RECONCILIATION   \n---  \nReported GAAP measure  |  Intangible amortization  expense  |  Restructuring & integration charges  |  Non-GAAP measure   \nNet income per diluted share  |  $1.35 to $1.55  |  $0.10  |  $1.03  |  $2.48 to $2.68   \n  \n** Earnings Presentation **\n\nPlease refer to the earnings presentation, which can be found at [investor.arrow.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.arrow.com&esheet=54145138&newsitemid=20241031098147&lan=en-US&anchor=investor.arrow.com&index=1&md5=73745d475c8880a560b08b7489ed1c9f), as a supplement to the company’s earnings release.

These and other forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional charges not currently contemplated and failure to realize contemplated cost savings due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the Plan; unfavorable economic conditions; disruptions or inefficiencies in the supply chain; political instability and changes; impacts of military conflict and sanctions; industry conditions; changes in product supply, pricing and customer demand; competition; other vagaries in the global components and the global ECS markets; deteriorating economic conditions, including economic recession, inflation, tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the availability of capital; the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; changes in relationships with key suppliers; increased profit margin pressure; changes in legal and regulatory matters; non-compliance with certain regulations, such as export, antitrust, and anti-corruption laws; foreign tax and other loss contingencies; breaches of security or privacy of business information and information system failures, including related to current or future implementations, integrations and upgrades; outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises; restructuring activities and impacts thereof; and the company's ability to generate positive cash flow. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause the company's future results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in other filings the company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders and other readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements. \n\n** Certain Non-GAAP Financial Information **\n\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the company also provides certain non-GAAP financial information. The company provides the following non-GAAP metrics: sales, operating income (including by business segment), income before income taxes, provision for income taxes, consolidated net income, noncontrolling interest, net income attributable to shareholders, effective tax rate and net income per share on a diluted basis. The foregoing non-GAAP measures are adjusted by certain of the following, as applicable: impact of changes in foreign currencies (referred to as “changes in foreign currencies” or “on a constant currency basis”) by re-translating prior-period results at current period foreign exchange rates; identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges; net gains and losses on investments; write downs (reversals) to inventory related to the wind down of a business within the global components reportable segment (“impact of wind down”); loss on extinguishment of debt; and impact of tax legislation changes. Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company’s operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management, especially when comparing results with previous periods. Management typically monitors the business as adjusted for these items, in addition to GAAP results, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate the company's financial performance. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, data presented in accordance with GAAP. For further discussion of our non-GAAP measures and related adjustments, refer to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nARROW ELECTRONICS, INC.

The company may sell up to €600.0 million\nunder the EMEA asset securitization program, which matures in December 2025, subject to extension in accordance with its\nterms. The program is conducted through Arrow EMEA Funding Corp B.V., an entity structured to be bankruptcy remote. The\ncompany is deemed the primary beneficiary of Arrow EMEA Funding Corp B.V. as the company has both the power to direct\nthe activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right\nto receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivable into\nthe special purpose entity. Accordingly, Arrow EMEA Funding Corp B.V. is included in the company’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nSales of accounts receivable to unaffiliated financial institutions under the EMEA asset securitization program:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nEMEA asset securitization, sales of accounts receivable $ 437,052 $ 815,812 $ 1,454,711 $ 2,486,022\nReceivables sold to unaffiliated financial institutions under the program are excluded from “Accounts receivable, net” on the\ncompany’s consolidated balance sheets, and cash receipts are reflected in the “Cash provided by operating activities” section\nof the consolidated statements of cash flows. The purchase price is paid in cash when the receivables are sold. Certain unsold\nreceivables held by Arrow EMEA Funding Corp B.V. are pledged as collateral to unaffiliated financial institutions. These\nunsold receivables are included in “Accounts receivable, net” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe company continues servicing the receivables which were sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under the program.\nThe company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as the company\nestimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the\nservicing activities.\nOther amounts related to the EMEA asset securitization program are set forth below:\nSeptember 28, December 31,\n(thousands) 2024 2023\nReceivables sold to unaffiliated financial institutions that were uncollected $ 348,324 $ 529,266\nCollateralized accounts receivable held by Arrow EMEA funding Corp B.V. 618,086 805,788\nAny accounts receivable held by Arrow EMEA Funding Corp B.V. would likely not be available to other creditors of the\ncompany in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings if there are outstanding balances under the EMEA asset\nsecuritization program.

As of September 28, 2024, the company was in\ncompliance with all such financial covenants. As of September 28, 2024, and the date of issuance of the financial statements in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the company was out of compliance with certain operational covenants in its EMEA\nasset securitization program due to an administrative error. As a result, the participating banks have the right to declare the\noccurrence of an early amortization event, which would result in the cessation of further amounts being sold under the\nprogram. All participating banks have agreed to waivers and the parties are in the process of formalizing an amendment to the\nprogram which would return the company to compliance.\nFactoring\nIn the normal course of business, certain of the company’s subsidiaries have factoring agreements to sell, with limited or no\nrecourse, selected trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and accounts for these transactions as sales of the related\nreceivables. The receivables are excluded from “Accounts receivable, net” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and\ncash receipts are reflected as “Cash provided by operating activities” on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The\ncompany typically does not retain financial or legal interests in these receivables. Factoring fees for the sales of accounts\nreceivables are included in “Interest and other financing expense, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. The\ncompany continues servicing the receivables which were sold.\nSales of trade accounts receivable under the company’s factoring programs:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSales of accounts receivable under the factoring programs $ 238,388 $ 341,096 $ 686,309 $ 1,141,533\nOther amounts under the company’s factoring programs:\nSeptember 28, December 31,\n(thousands) 2024 2023\nReceivables sold under the factoring programs that were uncollected $ 183,210 $ 375,940\nNote F – Supplier Finance Programs\nAt the request of certain of the company’s suppliers, the company has entered into agreements (“supplier finance programs”)\nwith third-party finance providers, which facilitate the participating suppliers’ ability to sell their receivables from the\ncompany to the third-party financial institutions, at the sole discretion of the suppliers. For agreeing to participate in these\nprograms, the company seeks to secure improved standard payment terms with its suppliers. The company is not involved in\nnegotiating terms of the arrangements between its suppliers and the financial institutions and has no economic interest in a\nsupplier’s decision to enter into these agreements, or sell receivables from the company. The company’s rights and obligations\nto its suppliers, including amounts due, are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under the arrangements.\nHowever, the company agrees to make all payments to the third-party financial institutions, and the company’s right to offset\nbalances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by the agreements for those payment obligations that\nhave been sold by suppliers. As of September 28, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the company had $734.2 million and $1.1\nbillion, respectively, in obligations outstanding under these programs included in “Accounts\n15\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Notes\nARROW ELECTRONICS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\npayable” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and all activity related to the obligations is presented within operating\nactivities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nNote G – Debt\nShort-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt, consist of the following:\nSeptember 28, December 31,\n(thousands) 2024 2023\n3.25% notes, due September 2024 $ — $ 499,224\n4.00% notes, due April 2025 349,618 —\nCommercial paper 539,191 1,121,882\nOther short-term borrowings 21,017 32,848\n$ 909,826 $ 1,653,954\nThe company has $500.0 million in uncommitted lines of credit.

The facility may be used by the\ncompany for general corporate purposes including working capital in the ordinary course of business, letters of credit,\nrepayment, prepayment or purchase of long-term indebtedness, acquisitions, and as support for the company’s commercial\npaper program, as applicable. Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated using a base rate or\nSOFR, plus a spread (1.08% at September 28, 2024), which is based on the company’s credit ratings, plus a credit spread\nadjustment of 0.10% or a weighted-average effective interest rate of 6.45% at September 28, 2024. The facility fee, which is\nbased on the company’s credit ratings, was 0.175% of the total borrowing capacity at September 28, 2024. The company had\nno outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe company has a North American asset securitization program collateralized by accounts receivable of certain of its\nsubsidiaries. The company may borrow up to $1.5 billion under the program. In September 2024, the company amended its\nNorth American asset securitization program to extend its maturity from September 2025 to September 2027, among other\nthings. The program is conducted through AFC, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. The North American asset\nsecuritization program does not qualify for sale treatment. Accordingly, the accounts receivable and related debt obligation\nremain on the company’s consolidated balance sheets. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate plus a spread\n(0.40% at September 28, 2024) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% or an effective interest rate of 5.34% at\nSeptember 28, 2024. The facility fee is 0.40% of the total borrowing capacity.\nThe company had $251.0 million and $198.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the North American asset securitization\nprogram at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which was included in “Long-term debt” on the\ncompany’s consolidated balance sheets. Total collateralized accounts receivable of approximately $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion\nwere held by AFC and were included in “Accounts receivable, net” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets at\nSeptember 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Any accounts receivable held by AFC would likely not be available\nto other creditors of the company in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of the company before repayment of\nany outstanding borrowings under the North American asset securitization program.\nBoth the revolving credit facility and North American asset securitization program include terms and conditions that limit the\nincurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels. As of\nSeptember 28, 2024, the company was in compliance with all such financial covenants.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the company completed the sale of $500.0 million principal amount of 5.15% notes, due\n2029. The net proceeds of the offering of $494.9 million were used for general corporate purposes and to repay the $500.0\nmillion principal amount of its 3.25% notes, due September 2024, which were redeemed at maturity.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Notes\nARROW ELECTRONICS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the company completed the sale of $500.0 million principal amount of 5.875% notes, due\n2034. The net proceeds of the offering of $494.7 million were used for general corporate purposes and to repay the $500.0\nmillion principal amount of its 6.125% notes, due 2026, which were redeemed in April 2024.\nInterest and dividend income of $10.3 million and $44.6 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024,\nrespectively, and $16.9 million and $47.6 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, were\nrecorded in “Interest and other financing expense, net” within the company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nNote H – Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on\nthe measurement date. The company utilizes a fair value hierarchy, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy has three levels of inputs that\nmay be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted\nassets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for\nsubstantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and\nunobservable.\nThe following table presents assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 28, 2024:\n(thousands) Balance Sheet Location Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents (a) Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,777 $ — $ — $ 10,777\nEquity investments (b) Other assets 46,741 — — 46,741\nForeign exchange contracts designated as net\ninvestment hedges Other assets / other current assets — 40,040 — 40,040\n$ 57,518 $ 40,040 $ — $ 97,558\nThe following table presents assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023:\n(thousands) Balance Sheet Location Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents (a) Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,729 $ — $ — $ 8,729\nEquity investments (b) Other assets 57,625 — — 57,625\nInterest rate swap designated as fair value hedge Other liabilities — (454) — (454)\nForeign exchange contracts designated as net\ninvestment hedges Other assets / other current assets — 47,245 — 47,245\n$ 66,354 $ 46,791 $ — $ 113,145\n(a) Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months.\n(b) The company has an approximately 9% equity ownership interest in Marubun Corporation and a portfolio of mutual funds with quoted market\nprices. The company recorded unrealized gains (losses) of $1.6 million and ($8.5) million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024,\nrespectively, on equity securities held at the end of the quarter. The company recorded unrealized (losses) gains of ($4.2) million and $1.6 million\nfor the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, on equity securities held at the end of the quarter.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Notes\nARROW ELECTRONICS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (refer to Note C). The company tests these assets for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist or\nat least annually if indefinite-lived.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, for purposes other than trading. Certain\nderivative instruments are designated at inception as hedges and assessed for effectiveness both at inception and on an\nongoing basis. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets\nwith changes in fair value recognized in earnings.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe company manages the risk of variability in interest rates of future expected debt issuances by entering into various\nforward-starting interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as\ncash flow hedges are recorded in the shareholders’ equity section in the company’s consolidated balance sheets in\n“Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and will be reclassified into income over the life of the anticipated debt issuance or\nin the period the hedged forecasted cash flows are deemed no longer probable to occur. Reclassified gains and losses are\nrecorded within the line item “Interest and other financing expense, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair\nvalue of interest rate swaps are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative\nusing observable inputs, including interest rate curves and credit spreads.\nIn June 2023, the company terminated its outstanding forward-starting interest rate swaps and received a cash payment of\n$56.7 million, which was reported in the “Cash flows from financing activities” section of the consolidated statements of cash\nflows. In April 2024, the forecasted bond issuance occurred, and the $56.7 million gain will be amortized to \"Interest and\nother financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statement of operations over the 10-year life of the bond.\nThe company occasionally enters into interest rate swap transactions, designated as fair value hedges, that convert certain\nfixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. For qualifying interest\nrate fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives are included in “Interest and other financing expense, net” in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is\nreported as an adjustment to its carrying value and is also included in “Interest and other financing expense, net”.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the company had one outstanding interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge of its 6.125%\nnotes due in March 2026, the terms of which were as follows:\nNotional Amount Interest Rate due Interest Rate due to\nTrade Date Maturity Date (thousands) from Counterparty Counterparty\nFebruary 2023 March 2026 $ 500,000 6.125% SOFR+0.508%\nThe counterparty to the interest rate swap had the option to cancel the swaps after one year, without penalty. In March 2024,\nthe counterparty cancelled the swap and the company de-designated the fair value hedging relationship.\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nThe company’s foreign currency exposure relates primarily to international transactions where the currency collected from\ncustomers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product. The company’s exposures to such transactions are\ndenominated primarily in the following currencies: Euro, Indian Rupee, and Israeli New Shekel. The company enters into\nforeign exchange forward, option, or swap contracts (collectively, the “foreign exchange contracts”) to facilitate the\n19\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Notes\nARROW ELECTRONICS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nhedging of foreign currency exposures resulting from inventory purchases and sales and mitigate the impact of changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates related to these transactions. Foreign exchange contracts generally have terms of no more\nthan six months. The company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes. The risk of loss on a\nforeign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties, which the company minimizes by limiting its\ncounterparties to major financial institutions. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is estimated using foreign\ncurrency spot rates and forward rates quotes by third-party financial institutions. The notional amount of the foreign exchange\ncontracts inclusive of foreign exchange contracts designated as a net investment hedge at September 28, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 was $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.\nGains and losses related to non-designated foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in “Cost of sales” on the\ncompany’s consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses related to foreign currency exchange contracts designated\nas cash flow hedges are recorded in “Cost of sales,” “Selling, general, and administrative,” and “Interest and other financing\nexpense, net” based upon the nature of the underlying hedged transaction, on the company’s consolidated statements of\noperations.

The Plan is\ndesigned to improve operational efficiency through the following measures: (i) reorganizing and consolidating certain areas of\nthe company’s operations to centralize functions and streamline resources, with a focus on more cost-efficient regions; (ii)\nenhancing warehouse and logistics operations; (iii) investing in information technology to support automation and process\nimprovements; (iv) consolidating the company’s global real estate footprint; (v) reducing third-party spending; and (vi)\nwinding down certain non-core businesses that are not aligned with the company’s strategic objectives. Under the Plan, the\ncompany expects to incur pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $185.0 million, consisting of approximately $110.0\nmillion of employee severance and other personnel cash expenditures; approximately $50.0 million of non-cash asset\nimpairments, accelerated depreciation and inventory write-downs related to the wind-down of certain business operations; and\napproximately $25.0 million of other related cash expenditures. The company expects to substantially complete the Plan by\nthe end of fiscal year 2026, subject to, among other things, local legal and consultation requirements.\nThe estimate of the charges that the company expects to incur in connection with the Plan, and the timing thereof, are subject\nto a number of assumptions, including local legal requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ\nmaterially from estimates. In addition, the company may incur other charges not currently contemplated due to unanticipated\nevents that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the Plan.\nOther Charges\nFor the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, other charges included the following:\n● charges of $20.3 million and $80.8 million for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, respectively,\nrelated to the termination of personnel as a part of operating expense reduction initiatives not related to exit or\ndisposal activities. As of September 28, 2024, the accrued liabilities related to the operating expense reduction\ninitiatives totaled $45.8 million and substantially all accrued amounts are expected to be spent in cash within one\nyear;\n● consulting costs of $11.2 million and $25.3 million for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024,\nrespectively, related to ongoing cost reduction initiatives; and\n● charges of $0.3 million and $6.8 million related to early lease terminations and related asset impairments.\nFor the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, other charges include $20.9 million and $23.3 million, respectively, related\nto an increase in environmental liabilities (Refer to the heading “Environmental matters” in Note L).\n22\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Notes\nARROW ELECTRONICS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote J – Net Income per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareholders by the weighted-average number\nof common shares outstanding for the period.

During the first nine months of 2024, the company accrued $1.6 million of excise tax, which is recorded within\n“Treasury stock” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and reduces the share-repurchase authorization, as the excise\ntax is a part of the overall cost of acquiring treasury shares. As of September 28, 2024, approximately $374.6 million remained\navailable for repurchase under the share-repurchase program. The company’s share-repurchase program does not have an\nexpiration date.\nNote L – Contingencies\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company has accrued liabilities of $25.0 million for ongoing environmental remediation efforts at sites in Huntsville,\nAlabama (the “Huntsville site”) and Norco, California (the “Norco site”) at which contaminated soil and groundwater was\nidentified. The contamination related to activities of certain subsidiaries which ended prior to 2000. Remediation efforts began\nin 2015 and 2003 at the Huntsville site and Norco site, respectively, and are progressing under action plans monitored by local\nenvironmental agencies.\nCosts are recorded for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the\nliability can be reasonably estimated. Environmental liabilities are included in “Accrued expenses” and “Other liabilities”\n25\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Notes\nARROW ELECTRONICS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\non the company’s consolidated balance sheets. The company has determined that there is no amount within the environmental\nliability ranges discussed below, that is a better estimate than any other amount, and therefore has recorded the accruals at the\nminimum amount of the ranges. The liabilities were estimated based on current costs and are not discounted. Environmental\ncosts related to these matters include remediation, project management, regulatory oversight, and investigative and feasibility\nstudy activities.\nTo date, the company has spent approximately $9.0 million and $85.5 million related to environmental costs at the Huntsville\nsite and the Norco site, respectively. The subsequent environmental costs at the Huntsville site are estimated to be between\n$5.3 million and $17.0 million and at the Norco site they are estimated to be between $19.7 million and $35.9 million.\nThe company expects the liabilities associated with such ongoing remediation to be resolved over an extended period of time\nwith current estimates extending beyond 2040. The accruals for environmental liabilities are adjusted periodically as facts and\ncircumstances change, assessment and remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes\navailable. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to various unknown factors such as the timing and\nextent of remediation, the efficacy and long-term costs of remediation, improvements in remediation technologies, orders by\nadministrative agencies, and the extent to which environmental laws and regulations may change in the future. Accordingly,\nthe company cannot presently estimate the ultimate potential costs related to either of the two sites.\nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the company recorded charges of $20.9 million and $23.3 million,\nrespectively, related to increases in the environmental liabilities for the Huntsville and Norco sites. These costs are included in\n“Restructuring, integration, and other” on the company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nTo date, the company has recovered approximately $47.3 million from certain insurance carriers relating to environmental\nclean-up matters at these sites and continues to pursue additional recoveries from one insurer related solely to the Huntsville\nsite. The company has not recorded a receivable for any potential future insurance recoveries.\nIt is reasonably possible that the company will need to adjust the liabilities noted above to reflect the effects of new or\nadditional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future\nchanges in estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on the\ncompany’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOther\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the company received $62.2 million in settlement funds in connection with claims filed\nagainst certain manufacturers of aluminum, tantalum, and film capacitors who allegedly colluded to fix the price of capacitors\nfrom 2001 through 2014. These amounts were recorded as a reduction to “Selling, general, and administrative” in the\ncompany’s consolidated statements of operations.\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, the company may become liable with respect to other pending and\nthreatened litigation, environmental, regulatory, labor, product, and tax matters. While such matters are subject to inherent\nuncertainties, it is not currently anticipated that any such matters will materially impact the company’s consolidated financial\nposition, liquidity, or results of operations.\nNote M – Segment and Geographic Information\nThe company is a global provider of products, services, and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic\ncomponents and enterprise computing solutions.

These trends could continue\nthroughout 2024 and the duration and severity of the current downturn remain uncertain.\n● Within the company’s global ECS reportable segment, in certain periods, changes in the mix of sales of IT solutions\ncan impact the proportion of the company’s revenue that is recorded on a net basis compared to a gross basis. This is\ndriven by the company’s responsibilities in the sale of various IT solutions, which is based on terms and conditions\nin place with its partners. These changes can increase or decrease sales during a period without a corresponding\nchange in gross profit. Refer to Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n● On October 31, 2024, the company announced a multi-year restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve\nefficiencies.

The decrease in sales compared to the year-earlier\nperiods was primarily due to the following impacts:\n32\nTable of Contents\n● sales declines in the Americas region primarily due to decreased demand for most major verticals, particularly\nindustrial and communications;\n● sales declines in the EMEA region primarily due to decreased demand for industrial and transportation verticals;\n● sales declines in the Asia/Pacific region primarily due to decreased demand for industrial and networking &\ncommunications verticals.\nWithin the global ECS reportable segment, growth in the EMEA region for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024,\nrelative to the year-earlier periods, is primarily due to increased demand for business applications, infrastructure applications,\nand compute. During the third quarter of 2024, sales in the Americas region were driven by relative strength in the public\nsector and for cloud-related solutions, largely offset by softness in data storage, cyber security and data intelligence. During\nthe first nine months of 2024, sales in the Americas region decreased primarily due to decreased demand for storage and\nsecurity.\nSubstantially all of the company’s sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As\nsuch, the nature of the company’s business does not provide for the visibility of material forward-looking information from its\ncustomers and suppliers beyond a few months.\nGross Profit\nFollowing is an analysis of the company’s consolidated gross profit:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nGross profit, as reported $ 785 $ 980 (19.9)% $ 2,489 $ 3,159 (21.2)%\nImpact of wind down to\ninventory (2) — 10 —\nImpact of changes in foreign\ncurrencies — 4 — (3)\nNon-GAAP gross profit $ 783 $ 983 (20.4)% $ 2,499 $ 3,157 (20.8)%\nGross profit as a percentage of\nsales, as reported 11.5% 12.2% (70) bps 12.1% 12.5% (40) bps\nNon-GAAP gross profit as a\npercentage of sales 11.5% 12.2% (70) bps 12.1% 12.5% (40) bps\nThe sum of the components for non-GAAP gross profit may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.\nThe decrease in gross profit related primarily to declining demand and gross profit margins for the third quarter and the first\nnine months of 2024.\n● Global components gross profit margins decreased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024,\ncompared with the year-earlier periods, due to product mix shifting toward lower margin products and regional mix\nshifting more towards the Asia/Pacific region. Global components supply chain services offerings continued to have\na positive impact on gross margins.\n● Global ECS gross profit margins decreased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, compared with\nthe year-earlier periods, due to softer margins in the Americas region as the company works to optimize the customer\nmix and supplier line card to better serve the mid-market.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nFollowing is an analysis of the company’s consolidated operating expenses:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nOperating expenses, as reported $ 610 $ 640 (4.7)% $ 1,916 $ 2,005 (4.5)%\nIdentifiable intangible asset\namortization (7) (8) (22) (24)\nRestructuring, integration, and\nother (34) (31) (122) (44)\nImpact of changes in foreign\ncurrencies — 2 — (1)\nNon-GAAP operating expenses $ 568 $ 602 (5.7)% $ 1,771 $ 1,936 (8.5)%\nOperating expenses as a\npercentage of sales 8.9% 8.0% 90 bps 9.3% 7.9% 140 bps\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\nas a percentage of sales, constant\ncurrency 8.3% 7.5% 80 bps 8.6% 7.7% 90 bps\nThe sum of the components for non-GAAP operating expenses may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.\nOperating expenses decreased by $29.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the year-earlier period primarily due\nto the following:\n● a decrease of $50.5 million in charges taken for allowance for credit losses;\n● a decrease of $26.4 million in employee related costs, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and lower sales\nincentives; partially offset by\n● an increase of $62.2 million due to a legal settlement benefit recognized in connection with certain legal matters in\n2023 with no similar items recorded in 2024.\nOperating expenses decreased by $89.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the year-earlier period primarily\ndue to the following:\n● a decrease of $93.0 million in employee related costs, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and lower sales\nincentives;\n● a decrease of $86.8 million in charges taken for allowance for credit losses; partially offset by\n● an increase of $77.6 million due to higher restructuring, integration and other charges (see discussion below); and\n● an increase of $62.2 million due to a legal settlement benefit recognized in connection with certain legal matters in\n2023 with no similar items recorded in 2024.\nThe changes discussed above related to the allowance for credit losses include charges of $21.9 million and $25.4 million\nrecorded during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, related to one customer in the global ECS\nreportable segment, of which $20.0 million was subsequently reversed upon recovery during the second quarter of 2024.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring, Integration, and Other\nRestructuring initiatives and integration costs are due to the company’s continued efforts to lower costs, drive operational\nefficiency, integrate acquired businesses, and consolidate certain operations, as necessary. The company recorded\nrestructuring, integration, and other charges as follows:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRestructuring and integration charges $ 1 $ 2 $ 1 $ 10\nOther charges 34 30 121 34\nTotal $ 35 $ 31 $ 122 $ 44\nThe sum of the components for restructuring, integration, and other may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.\nOn October 31, 2024, in response to evolving business needs and as part of an initiative to optimize operating expenses, the\ncompany announced a multi-year restructuring plan (the “Operating Expense Efficiency Plan” or “the Plan”). The Plan is\ndesigned to improve operational efficiency through the following measures: (i) reorganizing and consolidating certain areas of\nthe company’s operations to centralize functions and streamline resources, with a focus on more cost-efficient regions; (ii)\nenhancing warehouse and logistics operations; (iii) investing in information technology to support automation and process\nimprovements; (iv) consolidating the company’s global real estate footprint; (v) reducing third-party spending; and (vi)\nwinding down certain non-core businesses that are not aligned with the company’s strategic objectives. Under the Plan, the\ncompany expects to incur pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $185.0 million, consisting of approximately $110.0\nmillion of employee severance and other personnel cash expenditures; approximately $50.0 million of non-cash asset\nimpairments, accelerated depreciation and inventory write-downs related to the wind-down of certain business operations; and\napproximately $25.0 million of other related cash expenditures. The company expects to substantially complete the Plan by\nthe end of fiscal year 2026, subject to, among other things, local legal and consultation requirements.\nAs a result of the Plan, the company expects to reduce annual operating expenses by approximately $90.0 million to $100.0\nmillion by the end of fiscal year 2026.\nThe estimate of the charges that the company expects to incur in connection with the Plan, and the timing thereof, are subject\nto a number of assumptions, including local legal requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ\nmaterially from estimates. In addition, the company may incur other charges not currently contemplated due to unanticipated\nevents that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the Plan.\nOther Charges\nFor the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, other charges included the following:\n● charges of $20.3 million and $80.8 million for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, respectively,\nrelated to the termination of personnel as a part of operating expense reduction initiatives not related to exit or\ndisposal activities;\n● consulting costs of $11.2 million and $25.3 million for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024,\nrespectively, related to ongoing cost reduction initiatives; and\n● charges of $0.3 million and $6.8 million related to early lease terminations and related asset impairments.\nFor the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, other charges include $20.9 million and $23.3 million, respectively, related\nto an increase in environmental liabilities (refer to the heading “Environmental Matters” in Note L “Contingencies” of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n35\nTable of Contents\nOperating Income\nFollowing is an analysis of the company’s consolidated operating income, and operating income for the company’s two\nreportable segments:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nConsolidated operating income,\nas reported $ 175 $ 340 (48.5)% $ 573 $ 1,154 (50.3)%\nIdentifiable intangible asset\namortization 7 8 22 24\nRestructuring, integration,\nand other 34 31 122 44\nImpact of wind down to\ninventory (2) — 10 —\nNon-GAAP consolidated\noperating income $ 215 $ 379 (43.3)% $ 728 $ 1,222 (40.5)%\nConsolidated operating income\nas a percentage of sales 2.6% 4.2% (160) bps 2.8% 4.6% (180) bps\nNon-GAAP consolidated\noperating income as a\npercentage of sales 3.2% 4.7% (150) bps 3.5% 4.8% (130) bps\nGlobal components operating\nincome, as reported $ 189 $ 379 (50.2)% $ 624 $ 1,178 (47.0)%\nIdentifiable intangible asset\namortization 6 7 19 20\nImpact of wind down to\ninventory (2) — 10 —\nNon-GAAP global components\noperating income $ 193 $ 386 (50.0)% $ 654 $ 1,198 (45.4)%\nGlobal components operating\nincome as a percentage of sales 3.8% 6.1% (230) bps 4.1% 6.0% (190) bps\nNon-GAAP global components\noperating income as a\npercentage of sales 3.9% 6.2% (230) bps 4.3% 6.1% (180) bps\nGlobal ECS operating income,\nas reported $ 76 $ 55 38.4% $ 250 $ 222 12.5%\nIdentifiable intangible asset\namortization 1 1 3 4\nNon-GAAP global ECS\noperating income $ 77 $ 56 37.3% $ 253 $ 226 12.1%\nGlobal ECS operating income\nas a percentage of sales 4.0% 3.1% 90 bps 4.6% 4.1% 50 bps\nNon-GAAP global ECS\noperating income as a\npercentage of sales 4.1% 3.2% 90 bps 4.6% 4.1% 50 bps\nThe sum of the components of consolidated operating income do not agree to totals, as presented, because unallocated corporate amounts are not included in\nthe table above. Refer to Note M “Segment and Geographic Information” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in consolidated operating income as a percentage of sales for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024\nrelates primarily to the changes in sales, gross profit margins and operating expenses discussed above.\nThe decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales in the global components reportable segment for the third quarter\nand first nine months of 2024 relates primarily to lower sales, lower gross margins, and higher operating expenses as a\npercentage of sales. Higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales, when compared to the year earlier period, were\npartially due to $62.2 million in legal settlements recorded as a decrease to operating expense in third quarter of 2023 with no\nsimilar items recorded in 2024.\nThe increase in operating income as a percentage of sales in the global ECS reportable segment related primarily to a decrease\nin charges taken for the allowance for credit losses of $20.4 million and $48.1 million, respectively, primarily related to\ncharges of $21.9 million and $25.4 million, recorded during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively,\nrelated to one customer, of which $20.0 million was subsequently reversed upon recovery for aged receivables that were\ncollected during the second quarter of 2024.\nGain (Loss) on Investments, Net\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nGain (loss) on investments, net $ 4 $ (6) $ (1) $ 5\nGain (loss) on investments, net is primarily related to the changes in fair value of assets related to the Arrow SERP pension\nplan, which consist primarily of life insurance policies and mutual fund assets, as well as changes in the fair value of the\ncompany’s investment in Marubun Corporation, refer to Note H “Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value” of the\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest and Other Financing Expense, Net\nThe company recorded net interest and other financing expense as follows:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest and other financing expense, net $ (63) $ (82) $ (209) $ (247)\nThe decreases in interest and other financing expenses, net for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the\nyear-earlier periods were primarily related to lower average daily borrowings on floating rate credit facilities. Refer to the\nsection below titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information on changes in borrowings.\nIncome Tax\nIncome taxes for the interim periods presented have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements on\nthe basis of an estimated annual effective tax rate. The determination of the consolidated provision for income taxes requires\nmanagement to make certain judgments and estimates. Changes in the estimated level of annual pre-tax earnings, tax laws,\nand changes resulting from tax audits can affect the overall effective income tax rate, which impacts the level of income tax\nexpense and net income. Judgments and estimates related to the company’s projections and assumptions are inherently\nuncertain, therefore, actual results could differ from projections.\n37\nTable of Contents\nFollowing is an analysis of the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nEffective income tax rate 13.1% 20.7% 18.6% 22.0%\nIdentifiable intangible asset amortization 0.6% 0.1% 0.3% 0.1%\nRestructuring, integration, and other 2.7% 0.3% 1.6% 0.1%\n(Gain) loss on investments, net (0.3)% 0.1% —% —%\nImpact of wind down to inventory (0.1)% —% 0.1% —%\nImpact of tax legislation changes —% —% —% (0.1)%\nNon-GAAP effective income tax rate 15.9% 21.2% 20.6% 22.1%\nThe sum of the components for non-GAAP effective income tax rate may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.\nThe company’s effective tax rate deviates from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate mainly due to the mix of foreign\ntaxing jurisdictions in which the company operates and where its foreign subsidiaries generate taxable income, among other\nthings. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, compared to the year-\nearlier periods, is primarily driven by the level of taxable income and mix of tax jurisdictions where earnings are generated,\ndecreases to uncertain tax positions, including a favorable tax audit settlement, taxation of stock-based compensation, and tax\nlaw changes.\nNet Income Attributable to Shareholders\nFollowing is an analysis of the company’s consolidated net income attributable to shareholders:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income attributable to shareholders, as reported $ 101 $ 199 $ 293 $ 709\nIdentifiable intangible asset amortization* 7 8 22 23\nRestructuring, integration, and other 34 31 122 44\n(Gain) loss on investments, net (4) 6 1 (5)\nImpact of wind down to inventory (2) — 10 —\nLoss on extinguishment of debt — — 2 —\nTax effect of adjustments above (9) (11) (39) (15)\nImpact of tax legislation changes — — — 1\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders $ 128 $ 233 $ 410 $ 757\nThe sum of the components for non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.\n* Identifiable intangible asset amortization excludes amortization attributable to the noncontrolling interest.\nThe decrease in net income attributable to shareholders in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 compared to\nthe year-earlier periods, relates primarily to changes in sales, gross margins, interest and other financing expenses, net and\nincome tax as discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nManagement believes that the company’s current cash availability, its current borrowing capacity under its revolving credit\nfacility and asset securitization programs, and its expected ability to generate future operating cash flows are sufficient to meet\nits projected cash flow needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. The company’s current committed and\nundrawn liquidity stands at over $2.7 billion in addition to $248.0 million of cash on hand at September 28, 2024. The\ncompany also may issue debt or equity securities in the future and management believes the company will have adequate\naccess to the capital markets, if needed. The company continually evaluates its liquidity requirements and would seek to\namend its existing borrowing capacity or access the financial markets as deemed necessary.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe company’s principal sources of liquidity are existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and cash\nprovided by its revolving credit facilities and debt. The company’s principal uses of liquidity include cash used in operations,\ninvestments to grow working capital, scheduled interest and principal payments on its borrowings, and the return of cash to\nshareholders through share repurchases.\nThe following table presents selected financial information related to liquidity:\nSeptember 28, December 31,\n(millions) 2024 2023 Change\nWorking capital $ 6,864 $ 7,355 $ (491)\nCash and cash equivalents 248 218 30\nShort-term debt 910 1,654 744\nLong-term debt 2,363 2,154 (209)\nWorking Capital\nThe company maintains a significant investment in working capital which the company defines as accounts receivable, net,\nplus inventories less accounts payable. The change in working capital during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily\nattributable to decreases in inventory.\nWorking capital as a percentage of sales, which is defined as working capital divided by annualized quarterly sales, increased\nto 25.1% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 23.0% in the year-earlier period. The increase was primarily due to lower\nsales.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash, with original maturities of\nthree months or less. At September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $248.0\nmillion and $218.1 million, respectively, of which $200.1 million and $160.0 million, respectively, were held outside the\nUnited States.\nThe company has $5.3 billion of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which it deems indefinitely reinvested, and\nrecognizes that it may be subject to additional foreign taxes and U.S. state income taxes, if it reverses its indefinite\nreinvestment assertion on these foreign earnings. The company also has $2.2 billion of foreign earnings that are not deemed\npermanently reinvested and are available for distribution in future periods as of September 28, 2024.\nRevolving Credit Facilities and Debt\nThe following tables summarize the company’s credit facilities:\nOutstanding Borrowings\nBorrowing September 28, December 31,\n(millions) Capacity 2024 2023\nNorth American asset securitization program $ 1,500 $ 251 $ 198\nRevolving credit facility 2,000 — —\nCommercial paper program (a) 1,200 539 1,122\nUncommitted lines of credit 500 — —\n(a) Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are backstopped by available commitments under the company’s revolving credit\nfacility.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAverage Daily Balance Outstanding\nNine Months Ended Effective Interest Rate\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNorth American asset securitization program $ 603 $ 1,161 5.34% 5.82 %\nRevolving credit facility 4 173 6.45% 6.42 %\nCommercial paper program 526 717 5.25% 5.95 %\nUncommitted lines of credit 282 144 5.77% 6.42 %\nThe company also has an EMEA asset securitization program under which it continuously sells its interest in designated pools\nof trade accounts receivable of certain of its subsidiaries in the EMEA region. Receivables sold under the program are\nexcluded from “Accounts receivable, net” and no corresponding liability is recorded on the company’s consolidated balance\nsheets. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the average daily balance outstanding under the EMEA asset\nsecuritization program was $408.9 million and $644.6 million, respectively.\nAs of September 28, 2024, and the date of issuance of the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the\ncompany was out of compliance with certain operational covenants in its EMEA asset securitization program due to an\nadministrative error. As a result, the participating banks have the right to declare the occurrence of an early amortization event,\nwhich would result in the cessation of further amounts being sold under the program. All participating banks have agreed to\nwaivers and the parties are in the process of formalizing an amendment to the program which would return the company to\ncompliance.

The change in cash provided by operating activities during 2024, compared to\nthe year-earlier period, relates primarily to the company’s historical counter-cyclical cash flow as the company generates cash\nflow in periods of lower demand due to reduced investments in working capital.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe net amount of cash used for investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was $53.0 million and\n$46.8 million, respectively.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe net amount of cash used for financing activities was $755.4 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to\n$214.7 million used for financing activities in the year-earlier period. The change in cash used for financing activities relates\nprimarily to the repayment of debt and lower share repurchases during 2024.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were $70.2 million and $57.8 million, respectively. The company\nexpects capital expenditures to be approximately $100.0 million for the fiscal year 2024.\nShare-Repurchase Program\nThe company repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock for $200.0 million and 5.7 million shares of its common\nstock for $700.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, under its share-repurchase program,\nexcluding excise taxes. As of September 28, 2024, approximately $374.6 million remained available for repurchase under the\nshare-repurchase program. The share-repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of the repurchase\nactivity will depend on factors such as the company’s working capital needs, cash requirements for acquisitions, debt\nrepayment obligations or repurchases of debt, share price, and economic and market conditions. The share-repurchase\nprogram may be accelerated, suspended, delayed, or discontinued at any time subject to the approval of the company’s Board\nof Directors.\nContractual Obligations\nThe company has contractual obligations for short-term and long-term debt, interest on short-term and long-term debt,\npurchase obligations, operating leases, and other sources and uses of capital that are summarized in the sections titled\n“Contractual Obligations” and “Additional Capital Requirements and Sources” in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nRefer to the section above titled “Revolving Credit Facilities and Debt” for updates to the company’s short-term and long-term\ndebt obligations.

The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities. The company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The company bases its estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other\nsources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere have been no significant changes to the company’s critical accounting estimates for the first nine months of 2024.

These and other forward-looking statements\nare subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements\nfor a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: incurrence of additional charges not currently contemplated and failure to realize\ncontemplated cost savings due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of our restructuring\nplan; unfavorable economic conditions; disruptions or inefficiencies in the supply chain; political instability and changes; impacts of military\nconflict and sanctions; industry conditions; changes in product supply, pricing and customer demand; competition; other vagaries in the global\ncomponents and the global enterprise computing solutions (“ECS”) markets; deteriorating economic conditions, including economic recession,\ninflation, tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the availability of capital; the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;\nchanges in relationships with key suppliers; increased profit margin pressure; changes in legal and regulatory matters; non-compliance with\ncertain regulations, such as export, antitrust, and anti-corruption laws; foreign tax and other loss contingencies; breaches of security or privacy of\nbusiness information and information system failures, including related to current or future implementations, integrations and upgrades;\noutbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises; restructuring activities and impacts thereof; and the company's ability to generate\npositive cash flow.

end of this presentation\nCertain Non-GAAP financial\ninformation\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the company also provides certain\nnon-GAAP financial information relating to sales, gross profit, operating income (including by\nbusiness segment), operating margin, operating expense, consolidated net income,\nnoncontrolling interest, income before income taxes, net income attributable to shareholders,\neffective tax rate, net income per share on a diluted basis, return on working capital, and return\non invested capital.\nThese non-GAAP measures are adjusted by certain of the following, as applicable: the impact of\nchanges in foreign currencies (referred to as \"changes in foreign currencies\" or \"on a constant\ncurrency basis\") by re-translating prior-period results at current-period foreign exchange rates,\nidentifiable intangible asset amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, restructuring,\nintegration, and other charges, net gains and losses on investments, impact of wind down to\ninventory, and the impact of tax legislation changes.\nManagement believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better\nassess and understand the company's operating performance and future prospects in the same\nmanner as management, especially when comparing results with previous periods. Management\ntypically monitors the business as adjusted for these items, in addition to GAAP results, to\nunderstand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting\npurposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate the company's financial\nperformance. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement\nto, in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, data presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFor a complete reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results, please refer to\nreconciliations found at the end of this document.\n19\nFourth-quarter 2024 GAAP to non-GAAP outlook\nreconciliation\n($ in billions, except per share data)\nNON-GAAP SALES RECONCILIATION\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended\n31-Dec-24 31-Dec-23 % Change 31-Dec-24 28-Sep-24 % Change\nGlobal components sales, GAAP $ 4.50 -

The company provides the following non-GAAP metrics: sales, operating income (including by business segment), income before income taxes, provision for income taxes, consolidated net income, noncontrolling interest, net income attributable to shareholders, effective tax rate and net income per share on a diluted basis. The foregoing non-GAAP measures are adjusted by certain of the following, as applicable: impact of changes in foreign currencies (referred to as “changes in foreign currencies” or “on a constant currency basis”) by re-translating prior-period results at current period foreign exchange rates; identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges; net gains and losses on investments; write downs (reversals) to inventory related to the wind down of a business within the global components reportable segment (“impact of wind down”); loss on extinguishment of debt; and impact of tax legislation changes. Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company’s operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management, especially when comparing results with previous periods. Management typically monitors the business as adjusted for these items, in addition to GAAP results, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate the company's financial performance. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, data presented in accordance with GAAP. For further discussion of our non-GAAP measures and related adjustments, refer to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nARROW ELECTRONICS, INC.

(NYSE:ARW) today announced financial results for its second quarter of 2024. \n\n“We continued to execute well in an evolving market environment, delivering second-quarter sales and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share comfortably ahead of our guided ranges,” said Sean Kerins, Arrow’s president and chief executive officer. \n\n“In addition, our value-added offerings in global components as well as better momentum in enterprise computing solutions contributed to our overall operating margin stability in the quarter,” said Mr. Kerins. \n\nArrow Consolidated   \n---  \nQuarter Ended  |  Six Months Ended   \nJune 29,  |  July 1,  |  June 29,  |  July 1,   \n**(in millions except per share data)** |  2024  |  2023  |  2024  |  2023   \nConsolidated sales  |  $  |  6,893  |  $  |  8,515  |  $  |  13,817  |  $  |  17,251   \nNet income attributable to shareholders  |  109  |  237  |  192  |  510   \nNet income per diluted share  |  2.01  |  4.12  |  3.53  |  8.74   \nNon-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders (1) |  150  |  251  |  282  |  524   \nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share  |  2.78  |  4.37  |  5.18  |  8.98   \n  \nBoth GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter of 2024 include a $0.29 benefit and a $20 million operating income benefit related to the collection of certain aged receivables related to one customer in the ECS segment.

These and other forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; disruptions or inefficiencies in the supply chain; political instability and changes; impacts of military conflict and sanctions; industry conditions; changes in product supply, pricing and customer demand; competition; other vagaries in the global components and the global ECS markets; deteriorating economic conditions, including economic recession, inflation, tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the availability of capital; the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; changes in relationships with key suppliers; increased profit margin pressure; changes in legal and regulatory matters; non-compliance with certain regulations, such as export, antitrust, and anti-corruption laws; foreign tax and other loss contingencies; breaches of security or privacy of business information and information system failures, including related to current or future implementations, integrations and upgrades; outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises; and the company's ability to generate positive cash flow. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause the company's future results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in other filings the company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders and other readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements. \n\n** Certain Non-GAAP Financial Information **\n\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the company also provides certain non-GAAP financial information. The company provides the following non-GAAP metrics: sales, operating income (including by business segment), income before income taxes, net income attributable to shareholders, effective tax rate and net income per share on a diluted basis. The foregoing non-GAAP measures are adjusted by certain of the following, as applicable: impact of changes in foreign currencies (referred to as “changes in foreign currencies” or “on a constant currency basis”) by re-translating prior-period results at current period foreign exchange rates; identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges; net gains and losses on investments; impact of wind down to inventory; loss on extinguishment of debt; and impact of tax legislation changes. Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company’s operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management, especially when comparing results with previous periods. Management typically monitors the business as adjusted for these items, in addition to GAAP results, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate the company's financial performance.
