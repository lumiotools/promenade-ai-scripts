Cohen, chief executive officer. “Revenue growth for both sacral neuromodulation and Bulkamid® was driven by higher utilization at existing customers and the onboarding of new accounts.” \n\nMr. Cohen continued, “Our commitment to innovation, quality, direct-to-consumer advertising and providing strong clinical support continues to expand the market for life-changing incontinence therapies and propel Axonics on its path to market leadership. We look forward to the global impact the Axonics portfolio can make as part of Boston Scientific as we endeavor to treat more patients than ever before.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Net revenue was $116.2 million, an increase of 25% compared to the prior year period. \n    * Sacral neuromodulation revenue was $92.3 million, an increase of 25% compared to the prior year period. \n    * Bulkamid revenue was $23.8 million, an increase of 25% compared to the prior year period. \n  * Gross margin was 77.2% compared to 74.2% in the prior year period. \n  * Loss from operations was $6.3 million and includes $8 million of one-time legal and acquisition-related costs.

Axonics ranked No. 2 on the [2023](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2Fe57eead7-126e-4583-b3be-e99b5d19a054&esheet=54149191&newsitemid=20241107091750&lan=en-US&anchor=2023&index=1&md5=051dbbd90e0ea4ba1c4dec099e1ebc17) Financial Times ranking of the fastest growing companies in the Americas after being ranked No. 1 in [2022](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2F6ee8f978-a2e0-4644-b7c7-0718a334adb7&esheet=54149191&newsitemid=20241107091750&lan=en-US&anchor=2022&index=2&md5=d9b40af743aa0d71723504914018faf0). \n\nAxonics® sacral neuromodulation systems provide adults with overactive bladder and/or fecal incontinence with long-lived, easy to use, safe, clinically effective therapy. In addition, Axonics’ best-in-class urethral bulking hydrogel, Bulkamid®, provides safe and durable symptom relief to women with stress urinary incontinence. In the U.S., moderate to severe urinary incontinence affects an estimated 28 million women and fecal incontinence affects an estimated 19 million adults. For more information, visit [www.axonics.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.axonics.com&esheet=54149191&newsitemid=20241107091750&lan=en-US&anchor=www.axonics.com&index=3&md5=1363d9e8b8597d235e2754b55ba6c14d). \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement Axonics’ consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Axonics provides certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release as supplemental financial metrics. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as net loss before other income/expense (including interest), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, cash compensation in lieu of equity compensation due to pending merger, one-time litigation-related expense, acquired in-process research and development expense, loss on disposal of property and equipment, and expense related to impairment of intangible assets. Management believes that in order to properly understand short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may want to consider the impact of these excluded items in addition to GAAP measures. The excluded items vary in frequency and/or impact on our results of operations and management believes that the excluded items are typically not reflective of our ongoing core business operations and financial condition. Further, management uses adjusted EBITDA for both strategic and annual operating planning. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA reported in this release to the most comparable GAAP measure for the respective periods appears in the table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Net (Loss) Income to Adjusted EBITDA” later in this release. \n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used by Axonics may not be the same or calculated in the same manner as those used and calculated by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Axonics’ financial results prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. \n\n**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: AXNX) today announced that it has received regulatory approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for marketing the Axonics R20® rechargeable sacral neuromodulation (SNM) system in Australia to treat adults with overactive bladder and fecal incontinence. \n\nThe R20 neurostimulator is labeled for a functional life in the body of at least 20 years and reduces how frequently a patient needs to recharge their implanted device to once every 6 to 10 months for only one hour. The implant utilizes the same small 5cc form factor as the previous generation (Axonics R15®) and is paired with the same tined lead and intuitive, easy to use patient remote control. The R20 also provides physicians and their patients with enhanced programming capabilities and expanded MRI labeling. \n\n“Approval of the Axonics R20 is welcome news for Australians with bladder and bowel dysfunction,” said Dr. Janelle Brennan, a urologist at St. John of God Bendigo Hospital. “I am excited to offer my patients a therapy that provides durable symptom relief with a small rechargeable neurostimulator that can last over 20 years in the body.” \n\nAxonics commenced SNM commercial activities in Australia in March 2023. In May 2024, Axonics received regulatory approval from the TGA to market its F15® recharge-free SNM system. In Australia, Axonics also markets Bulkamid®, the company’s unique hydrogel indicated for female stress urinary incontinence. \n\n“We are delighted to receive regulatory approval for our latest rechargeable SNM system in Australia,” said Raymond W. Cohen, chief executive officer. “Our mission-driven team remains committed to innovating, supporting our dedicated physician customers and their patients, and raising awareness of our best-in-class incontinence therapies.” \n\nAxonics expects to commence sales of the R20 to Australian customers in November. \n\n**About Axonics**\n\nAxonics is a global medical technology company that is developing and commercializing novel products for adults with bladder and bowel dysfunction.

(Nasdaq: AXNX) today announced that the jury has returned a unanimous verdict in the patent infringement lawsuit brought by Medtronic against Axonics in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. \n\nThe jury found that Axonics does not infringe any of the three patents-in-suit. \n\n“A jury of our peers recognized that Axonics’ proprietary tined lead design and temperature sensor technology is differentiated from our competitor’s intellectual property,” said Raymond W. Cohen, chief executive officer. “As we have said since this case was first filed in late 2019, our view is that Medtronic’s lawsuit was initiated to stifle competition, limit patient and physician choice, and protect the incumbent’s monopoly in sacral neuromodulation. We are very pleased with the jury’s finding and continue to remain focused on fulfilling our mission of positively impacting the lives of adults with bladder and bowel dysfunction.” \n\n**About Axonics**\n\nAxonics is a global medical technology company that is developing and commercializing novel products for adults with bladder and bowel dysfunction.
