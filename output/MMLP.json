(Nasdaq: MMLP) (“MMLP” or the “Partnership”) today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. \n\nBob Bondurant, President and Chief Executive Officer of Martin Midstream GP LLC, the general partner of the Partnership (the \"General Partner\"), stated, “I am pleased with the Partnership’s third quarter financial results of $25.1 million in adjusted EBITDA despite the slight miss of $1.3 million when compared to guidance targeting $26.4 million in adjusted EBITDA. During the quarter, the Partnership recorded an additional $1.4 million in expense, when compared to guidance, related to our long-term incentive plans which are tied to the fair market value of our common units. With the exception of the Specialty Products division, financial results were above guidance in all remaining segments when allowing for this additional cost.” \n\n“As we look to the coming months leading up to the potential merger with MRMC, our team will remain dedicated to the execution of our long-term strategy; and focused on enhancing the value we provide to our customers, suppliers, and the communities where we live and where our businesses operate.” \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT**  \n---  \n**Operating Income (Loss) ($M)** |  **Credit Adjusted EBITDA ($M)** |  **Adjusted EBITDA ($M)**  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Amounts may not add or recalculate due to rounding)**  \n**Business Segment:**  \nTerminalling and Storage  |  $  |  2.7  |  $  |  3.1  |  $  |  8.4  |  $  |  8.2  |  $  |  8.4  |  $  |  8.2   \nTransportation  |  8.6  |  6.7  |  11.6  |  9.5  |  11.6  |  9.5   \nSulfur Services  |  1.3  |  2.7  |  4.2  |  5.4  |  4.2  |  5.4   \nSpecialty Products  |  3.9  |  6.0  |  4.6  |  6.8  |  4.6  |  6.8   \nUnallocated Selling, General and Administrative Expense  |  (3.7  |  )  |  (3.8  |  )  |  (3.7  |  )  |  (3.8  |  )  |  (3.7  |  )  |  (3.8  |  )   \n**$** |  **12.7** |  **$** |  **14.7** |  **$** |  **25.1** |  **$** |  **26.2** |  **$** |  **25.1** |  **$** |  **26.2**  \n  \n**Terminalling and storage** adjusted EBITDA increased $0.2 million, primarily reflecting increased throughput at our shore based terminals, offset by increased employee-related expenses. \n\n**Transportation** adjusted EBITDA increased $2.1 million, primarily reflecting higher day rates and utilization in our marine division. \n\n**Sulfur services** adjusted EBITDA decreased $1.2 million, primarily reflecting decreased fertilizer volumes and margins, offset by higher margins in our sulfur division. \n\n**Specialty products** adjusted EBITDA decreased $2.2 million, primarily reflecting decreased margins in our lubricants and grease divisions coupled with higher employee-related expenses. \n\n**Unallocated selling, general, and administrative expense** decreased $0.1 million, reflecting reduced overhead expenses allocated from MRMC. \n\n**CAPITALIZATION**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**($ in millions)**  \n**Debt Outstanding:**  \nRevolving Credit Facility, Due February 2027 1 |  $  |  86.5  |  $  |  42.5   \nFinance lease obligations  |  0.1  |  —   \n11.50% Senior Secured Notes, Due February 2028  |  400.0  |  400.0   \n**Total Debt Outstanding:** |  $  |  486.6  |  $  |  442.5   \n**Summary Credit Metrics:**  \nRevolving Credit Facility -

The ex-dividend date for the cash distribution is November 7, 2024. \n\n_Qualified Notice to Nominees_\n\nThis release is intended to serve as qualified notice under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d). Brokers and nominees should treat one hundred percent (100%) of MMLP’s distributions to non-U.S. investors as being attributable to income that is effectively connected with a _United States_ trade or business. Accordingly, MMLP’s distributions to non-U.S. investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate. For purposes of Treasury Regulation section 1.1446(f)-4(c)(2)(iii), brokers and nominees should treat one hundred percent (100%) of the distributions as being in excess of cumulative net income for purposes of determining the amount to withhold. Nominees, and not **Martin Midstream Partners L.P.** , are treated as withholding agents responsible for any necessary withholding on amounts received by them on behalf of foreign investors. \n\n**MERGER AGREEMENT WITH MARTIN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT CORPORATION**\n\nOn October 3, 2024, the Partnership announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (“Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which MRMC would acquire all of the outstanding common units of MMLP not already owned by MRMC and its subsidiaries (the “Public Common Units”). The Merger Agreement follows the offer made by MRMC in May 2024 to acquire the Public Common Units. \n\n**Investors' Conference Call**\n\nDate: **Thursday, October 17, 2024** Time: **8:00 a.m. CT** (please dial in by 7:55 a.m.) Dial In #: **(800) 715-9871** Conference ID: **8536096** Replay Dial In # **(800) 770-2030** – Conference ID: **8536096**\n\nA webcast of the conference call along with the Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Summary will also be available by visiting the Events and Presentations section under Investor Relations on our website at [www.MMLP.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.MMLP.com&esheet=54136997&newsitemid=20241016537515&lan=en-US&anchor=www.MMLP.com&index=1&md5=02afff07829c14cce176bad8ec1fb96f). \n\n_About Martin Midstream Partners_\n\nMartin Midstream Partners L.P., headquartered in Kilgore, Texas, is a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the United States.

These forward-looking statements and all references to financial estimates rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, including (i) the effects of the continued volatility of commodity prices and the related macroeconomic and political environment, (ii) the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in the anticipated timeframe or at all, including MRMC’s ability to fund the aggregate merger consideration; risks related to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing the transaction in the anticipated timeframe or at all; risks related to obtaining the requisite regulatory approval and Partnership unitholder approval; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; significant transaction costs associated with the transaction; and the risk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the transaction, (iii) uncertainties relating to the Partnership’s future cash flows and operations, (iv) the Partnership’s ability to pay future distributions, (v) future market conditions, (vi) current and future governmental regulation, (vii) future taxation, and (viii) other factors, many of which are outside its control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. While the Partnership believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in anticipating or predicting certain important factors. A discussion of these factors, including risks and uncertainties, is set forth in the Partnership’s annual and quarterly reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Partnership disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, including financial estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except where required to do so by law. \n\n_Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information_\n\nTo assist management in assessing our business, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), Credit Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), distributable cash flow available to common unitholders (“Distributable Cash Flow”), and free cash flow after growth capital expenditures and principal payments under finance lease obligations (\"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\"). Our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements other than our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to analyze our performance. \n\nCertain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity's financial performance, such as cost of capital and historical costs of depreciable assets. \n\n_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA_ . We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before unit-based compensation expenses, gains and losses on the disposition of property, plant and equipment, impairment and other similar non-cash adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental performance and liquidity measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts, and others, to assess: \n\n  * the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; \n  * the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness, and make cash distributions to our unitholders; and \n  * our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing methods or capital structure. \n\n\n\nWe define Credit Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA excluding net income (loss) and the lower of cost or net realizable value and other non-cash adjustments associated with the butane optimization business, which we exited during the second quarter of 2023. Credit Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental performance and liquidity measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts, and others to provide additional information regarding the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the Partnership’s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. \n\nThe GAAP measures most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA are net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate cash available for distribution. Because we have capital assets, depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs. Therefore, any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as determined under GAAP, as well as adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our overall performance. \n\n_Distributable Cash Flow._ We define Distributable Cash Flow as Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities less cash received (plus cash paid) for closed commodity derivative positions included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), plus changes in operating assets and liabilities which (provided) used cash, less maintenance capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs. Distributable Cash Flow is a significant performance measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash flows generated by us to the cash distributions we expect to pay unitholders. Distributable Cash Flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates. Distributable Cash Flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit's yield, which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder. \n\n_Adjusted Free Cash Flow._ We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Distributable Cash Flow less growth capital expenditures and principal payments under finance lease obligations. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a significant performance measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements and represents how much cash flow a business generates during a specified time period after accounting for all capital expenditures, including expenditures for growth and maintenance capital projects. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is important to investors, lenders, commercial banks and research analysts since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, and similar matters. Our calculation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. \n\nThe GAAP measure most directly comparable to Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow is Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, Net Income (Loss), Operating Income (Loss), Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities, or any other measure of liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow have important limitations because they exclude some items that affect Net Income (Loss), Operating Income (Loss), and Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate these non-GAAP metrics in the same manner. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities determined under GAAP, as well as Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, to evaluate our overall liquidity. \n\nMMLP-F \n\n**MARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**

(“MMLP”) (Nasdaq: MMLP) today announced it has filed a definitive proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with Martin Resource Management Corporation’s (“MRMC”) pending acquisition of all of the outstanding MMLP common units other than common units already owned by MRMC and its subsidiaries, in an all-cash merger transaction whereby each unitholder will receive $4.02 per common unit. MMLP also launched a website, MaximizeValueforMMLP.com, which highlights the terms and benefits of the transaction and provides voting instructions for eligible unitholders. \n\nThe MMLP Special Meeting of unitholders is scheduled to take place on December 30, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. CT, at MMLP’s office located at 4200 B Stone Road, Kilgore, Texas 75662. Unitholders of record as of November 8, 2024 are entitled to vote at the meeting. All eligible unitholders will receive a copy of the definitive proxy statement in the mail, along with instructions on how to vote their units. \n\n“The filing of the definitive proxy statement is an important milestone as we advance towards completing the transaction,” said Bob Bondurant, President and Chief Executive Officer of Martin Midstream GP LLC, the general partner of the Partnership (the “General Partner”). “The Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of the General Partner (the “GP Board”), which consists of three independent directors, conducted a thorough, nine-month evaluation with the support of independent legal and financial advisors and was diligent about considering the best path forward for MMLP. Ultimately, after extensive negotiations that resulted in a significantly improved proposal from MRMC, the Conflicts Committee unanimously and in good faith determined that the pending merger is fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, MMLP and the unaffiliated holders of MMLP common units. The transaction will deliver for unitholders a 34.00% premium to the market closing price prior to MRMC’s initial proposal on May 24, 2024, and an 11.33% premium to the trailing 30-trading day volume-weighted average price as of October 3, 2024, the date the merger agreement was executed. Notably, the transaction will deliver nearly a dollar more per unit than MRMC’s initial proposal. This is a terrific outcome for MMLP unitholders and the Conflicts Committee and the GP Board are unanimous in their support of the pending transaction.” \n\nThe Conflicts Committee and the GP Board unanimously recommend that unitholders use the **WHITE** proxy card or **WHITE** voting instruction form to vote **“FOR”** the proposal to approve the transaction and the merger agreement. \n\nAdditional information, including copies of the materials mailed to all eligible MMLP unitholders, is available at MaximizeValueforMMLP.com. \n\n**Advisors**\n\nThe Conflicts Committee engaged Munsch Hardt Kopf & Harr, P.C., Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP, and Houlihan Lokey, Inc. as its legal and financial advisors. MRMC engaged Baker Botts L.L.P. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as its legal and financial advisors. \n\n**About MMLP**\n\nMartin Midstream Partners L.P.

Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “should,” “will” or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements and all references to the transaction described herein rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, including (i) the ability of the parties to consummate the transaction in the anticipated timeframe or at all, including MRMC’s ability to fund the aggregate merger consideration; risks related to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing the transaction in the anticipated timeframe or at all; risks related to obtaining the requisite regulatory approval and MMLP unitholder approval; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; significant transaction costs associated with the transaction; and the risk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the transaction, (ii) uncertainties relating to MMLP’s future cash flows and operations, (iii) MMLP’s ability to pay future distributions, (iv) future market conditions, (v) current and future governmental regulation, (vi) future taxation, and (vii) other factors, many of which are outside MMLP’s control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. While MMLP believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in anticipating or predicting certain important factors. A discussion of these factors, including risks and uncertainties, is set forth in MMLP’s annual and quarterly reports filed from time to time with the SEC as well as MMLP’s definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on November 27, 2024. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and MMLP disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, including financial estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except where required to do so by law. \n\n**IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION**\n\nIn connection with the proposed merger, MMLP has filed with the SEC and furnished to MMLP’s unitholders the definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A and a proxy card.

Issues Statement Reaffirming Commitment to Pending Transaction\n\n10/22/2024\n\nDownloadPDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nKILGORE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Martin Midstream Partners L.P. (NASDAQ:MMLP) (“MMLP”) today issued the following statement in response to the press release issued by Nut Tree Capital Management and Caspian Capital: \n\nThe Conflicts Committee (the “Conflicts Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “GP Board”) of Martin Midstream GP LLC, the general partner of MMLP (the “General Partner”), which consists of three independent directors, conducted a thorough nine-month evaluation with the support of independent legal and financial advisors and was diligent about the best path forward for MMLP, including actively considering proposals submitted by Nut Tree Capital Management and Caspian Capital. Following extensive negotiations, the Conflicts Committee unanimously and in good faith determined that the merger transaction with Martin Resource Management Corporation (“MRMC”) is fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, MMLP and the unaffiliated holders of the MMLP common units. \n\nThe transaction provides an attractive premium valuation to MMLP unitholders, whereby each holder of the common units other than MRMC and its subsidiaries would receive $4.02 per common unit owned, representing a 34.00% premium to the market closing price prior to MRMC’s initial proposal made on May 24, 2024, and an 11.33% premium to the trailing 30-trading day volume-weighted average price as of October 3, 2024, the date the merger agreement was executed. \n\nNotably, the proposals submitted by Nut Tree and Caspian never represented a credible alternative or viable path forward. Further, the Nut Tree and Caspian proposals were predicated on acquiring the General Partner, which was not, and is not, for sale. Importantly, even their own press release noted that the hedge funds have “economic exposure” to MMLP common units, without disclosing any actual ownership. As debt investors in MMLP, with incremental derivative exposure to MMLP equity, Nut Tree’s and Caspian’s interests do not appear to be fully aligned with MMLP unitholders’. \n\nWe look forward to engaging with unitholders as we work toward completing the transaction by the end of 2024. \n\nThe Conflicts Committee engaged Munsch Hardt Kopf & Harr, P.C., Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP, and Houlihan Lokey, Inc. as its legal and financial advisors. MRMC engaged Baker Botts L.L.P. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as its legal and financial advisors. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). These forward-looking statements and all references to the transaction described herein rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, including (i) the ability of the parties to consummate the transaction in the anticipated timeframe or at all, including MRMC’s ability to fund the aggregate merger consideration; risks related to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing the transaction in the anticipated timeframe or at all; risks related to obtaining the requisite regulatory approval and MMLP unitholder approval; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; significant transaction costs associated with the transaction; and the risk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the transaction, (ii) uncertainties relating to MMLP’s future cash flows and operations, (iii) MMLP’s ability to pay future distributions, (iv) future market conditions, (v) current and future governmental regulation, (vi) future taxation, and (vii) other factors, many of which are outside its control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. While MMLP believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in anticipating or predicting certain important factors. A discussion of these factors, including risks and uncertainties, is set forth in MMLP’s annual and quarterly reports filed from time to time with the SEC. MMLP disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, including financial estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except where required to do so by law. \n\n**About MMLP**\n\nMartin Midstream Partners L.P.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to\nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(GAAP). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation to the most directly comparable financial measures\ncalculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is set forth in the Appendix of this presentation or on our web site at www.MMLP.com.\nMMLP’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may provide useful information to investors regarding MMLP’s financial\ncondition and results of operations as they provide another measure of the profitability and ability to service its debt and are considered important\nmeasures by financial analysts covering MMLP and its peers.\nThe Partnership has not provided comparable GAAP financial information on a forward-looking basis because it would require the Partnership to\ncreate estimated ranges on a GAAP basis, which would entail unreasonable effort. Adjustments required to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP\nmeasures cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty but may include, among others, costs related to debt amendments and unusual charges,\nexpenses and gains. Some or all of those adjustments could be significant.\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements about the Partnership's outlook and all other statements in this release other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within\nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements and all references to financial or operational\nestimates rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, (i) the effects of the continued\nvolatility of commodity prices and the related macroeconomic and political environment, and (ii) other factors, many of which are outside its control,\nwhich could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. While the Partnership believes that the assumptions concerning future\nevents are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in anticipating or predicting certain important factors. A discussion of these\nfactors, including risks and uncertainties, is set forth in the Partnership's annual and quarterly reports filed from time to time with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. The Partnership disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, including financial\nestimates, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except where required to do so by law.\nPage 4\nMartin Midstream Partners\n4200 B Stone Road\nKilgore, Texas 75662\n903.983.6200\nwww.MMLP.com"

These\nforward-looking statements and all references to financial estimates rely on a number of assumptions concerning\nfuture events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, including (i) the effects of the continued volatility of\ncommodity prices and the related macroeconomic and political environment, (ii) the ability of the parties to\nconsummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in the anticipated timeframe or at all,\nincluding MRMC’s ability to fund the aggregate merger consideration; risks related to the satisfaction or waiver of\nthe conditions to closing the transaction in the anticipated timeframe or at all; risks related to obtaining the requisite\nregulatory approval and Partnership unitholder approval; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to\nmaintain business and operational relationships; significant transaction costs associated with the transaction; and the\nrisk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the transaction, (iii) uncertainties relating to the Partnership’s\nfuture cash flows and operations, (iv) the Partnership’s ability to pay future distributions, (v) future market\nconditions, (vi) current and future governmental regulation, (vii) future taxation, and (viii) other factors, many of\nwhich are outside its control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. While the\nPartnership believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent\ndifficulties in anticipating or predicting certain important factors. A discussion of these factors, including risks and\nuncertainties, is set forth in the Partnership’s annual and quarterly reports filed from time to time with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Partnership disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any\nforward-looking statements, including financial estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events, or\notherwise except where required to do so by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nTo assist management in assessing our business, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), Credit\nAdjusted EBITDA (as defined below), distributable cash flow available to common unitholders (“Distributable\nCash Flow”), and free cash flow after growth capital expenditures and principal payments under finance lease\nobligations (\"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\"). Our management uses a variety of financial and operational\nmeasurements other than our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to analyze our\nperformance.\nCertain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and\nassessing an entity's financial performance, such as cost of capital and historical costs of depreciable assets.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before unit-\nbased compensation expenses, gains and losses on the disposition of property, plant and equipment, impairment and\nother similar non-cash adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental performance and liquidity\nmeasure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks,\nresearch analysts, and others, to assess:\n• the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical\ncost basis;\n• the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness, and make\ncash distributions to our unitholders; and\n• our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream\nenergy sector, without regard to financing methods or capital structure.\nWe define Credit Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA excluding net income (loss) and the lower of cost or net\nrealizable value and other non-cash adjustments associated with the butane optimization business, which we exited\nduring the second quarter of 2023. Credit Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental performance and liquidity\nmeasure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks,\nresearch analysts, and others to provide additional information regarding the calculation of, and compliance with,\ncertain financial covenants in the Partnership’s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe GAAP measures most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA are net income\n(loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA\nshould not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), net\ncash provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in\naccordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures of other companies because other companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nAdjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization.\nBecause we have borrowed money to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs\nand our ability to generate cash available for distribution. Because we have capital assets, depreciation and\namortization are also necessary elements of our costs. Therefore, any measures that exclude these elements have\nmaterial limitations. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider net income\n(loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as determined under GAAP, as well as adjusted\nEBITDA, to evaluate our overall performance.\nDistributable Cash Flow. We define Distributable Cash Flow as Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating\nActivities less cash received (plus cash paid) for closed commodity derivative positions included in Accumulated\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss), plus changes in operating assets and liabilities which (provided) used cash,\nless maintenance capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs. Distributable Cash Flow is a significant\nperformance measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors,\ncommercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash flows generated by us to the cash distributions we\nexpect to pay unitholders. Distributable Cash Flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders since\nit serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure\nindicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in\nour quarterly distribution rates. Distributable Cash Flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the\ninvestment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships because the value of a unit of such an entity is\ngenerally determined by the unit's yield, which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to\na unitholder.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Distributable Cash Flow less growth capital\nexpenditures and principal payments under finance lease obligations. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a significant\nperformance measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements and represents how\nmuch cash flow a business generates during a specified time period after accounting for all capital expenditures,\nincluding expenditures for growth and maintenance capital projects. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is\nimportant to investors, lenders, commercial banks and research analysts since it reflects the amount of cash\navailable for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, and similar matters. Our\ncalculation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other\nentities.\nThe GAAP measure most directly comparable to Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow is Net Cash\nProvided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be\nconsidered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, Net Income (Loss), Operating Income (Loss), Net Cash\nProvided by (Used in) Operating Activities, or any other measure of liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\nDistributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow have important limitations because they exclude some items\nthat affect Net Income (Loss), Operating Income (Loss), and Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities.\nDistributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other\ncompanies because other companies may not calculate these non-GAAP metrics in the same manner. To\ncompensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider Net Cash Provided by (Used in)\nOperating Activities determined under GAAP, as well as Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, to\nevaluate our overall liquidity.\nContact:\nSharon Taylor - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n(877) 256-6644\nir@mmlp.com\nMMLP-F\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM

These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to\nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(GAAP). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation to the most directly comparable financial measures\ncalculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is set forth in the Appendix of this presentation or on our web site at www.MMLP.com.\nMMLP’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may provide useful information to investors regarding MMLP’s financial\ncondition and results of operations as they provide another measure of the profitability and ability to service its debt and are considered important\nmeasures by financial analysts covering MMLP and its peers.\nThe Partnership has not provided comparable GAAP financial information on a forward-looking basis because it would require the Partnership to\ncreate estimated ranges on a GAAP basis, which would entail unreasonable effort. Adjustments required to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP\nmeasures cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty but may include, among others, costs related to debt amendments and unusual charges,\nexpenses and gains. Some or all of those adjustments could be significant.\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements about the Partnership's outlook and all other statements in this release other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within\nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements and all references to financial or operational\nestimates rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, (i) the effects of the continued\nvolatility of commodity prices and the related macroeconomic and political environment, and (ii) other factors, many of which are outside its control,\nwhich could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. While the Partnership believes that the assumptions concerning future\nevents are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in anticipating or predicting certain important factors. A discussion of these\nfactors, including risks and uncertainties, is set forth in the Partnership's annual and quarterly reports filed from time to time with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. The Partnership disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, including financial\nestimates, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except where required to do so by law.\nPage 4\nMartin Midstream Partners\n4200 B Stone Road\nKilgore, Texas 75662\n903.983.6200\nwww.MMLP.com"

These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology including \"forecast,\" \"may,\"\n\"believe,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" or other similar words. These statements discuss future expectations, contain projections of\nresults of operations or of financial condition or state other \"forward-looking\" information.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nMartin Midstream Partners L.P. (the \"Partnership\") is a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the\nGulf Coast region of the United States (\"U.S.\"). Its four primary business lines include: terminalling, processing, and storage services for petroleum products\nand by-products including the refining of naphthenic crude oil; land and marine transportation services for petroleum products and by-products, chemicals, and\nspecialty products; sulfur and sulfur-based products processing, manufacturing, marketing and distribution; and marketing, distribution, and transportation\nservices for natural gas liquids and blending and packaging services for specialty lubricants and grease.\nThe Partnership’s unaudited consolidated and condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q\nand U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these financial statements have been\ncondensed and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual audited financial statements of the type contained in the\nPartnership’s annual reports on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the management of the Partnership’s general partner, all adjustments and elimination of\nsignificant intercompany balances necessary for a fair presentation of the Partnership’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods\nshown have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Results for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of\noperations for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Partnership’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes\nthereto included in the Partnership’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.\nManagement has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities to prepare these consolidated and condensed financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\nNOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-07\"). ASU 2023-07 requires annual and interim disclosures that are expected to\nimprove reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The provisions of ASU 2023-07 are\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption\npermitted. The Partnership will adopt ASU 2023-07 and its expanded segment disclosure requirements in compliance with the required adoption guidelines.\nNOTE 3. EXIT OF BUTANE OPTIMIZATION BUSINESS\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Partnership completed its previously announced exit from its butane optimization business at the conclusion of the\nbutane selling season. This exit did not qualify as discontinued operations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 205.\nGoing forward, with respect to butane, the Partnership will operate as a fee-based butane logistics business, primarily continuing to utilize its north Louisiana\nunderground storage assets, which have both truck and rail capability. This logistics business will also utilize the Partnership's truck transportation assets for\nfee-based product movements. As a result of this new business model, the Partnership will no longer carry butane inventory, enabling the Partnership to reduce\ncommodity risk exposure, cash flow and earnings volatility, and working capital requirements. The following revenues and costs, which are included in the\nfinancial results for all periods presented, are not expected to be incurred under the new fee-based butane logistics business model. The butane optimization\nbusiness has historically been included in the Partnership's Specialty Products operating segment.\n9\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2023\nProducts revenue $ — $ 70,539\nCost of products sold — 72,282\nSelling, general and administrative expenses — 512\n$ — $ (2,255)\nNOTE 4.

The Partnership recognizes revenue when the Partnership satisfies a performance obligation, which typically occurs when the\nPartnership transfers control over a product to a customer or as the Partnership delivers a service.\nThe following is a description of the principal activities - separated by reportable segments - from which the Partnership generates revenue.\nTerminalling and Storage Segment\nRevenue is recognized for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee. For throughput contracts, revenue is recognized based on the\nvolume moved through the Partnership’s terminals at the contracted rate. For storage and throughput contracts at the Partnership's underground NGL storage\nfacility, revenue is recognized based on the volume stored\n10\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nand moved through the facility at the contracted rate. For the Partnership’s tolling agreement, revenue is recognized based on the contracted monthly\nreservation fee and throughput volumes moved through the facility. Throughput and storage revenue in the table above includes non-cancelable revenue\narrangements that are under the scope of ASC 842, whereby the Partnership has committed certain Terminalling and Storage assets in exchange for a minimum\nfee.\nTransportation Segment\nRevenue related to land transportation is recognized for line hauls based on a mileage rate. For contracted trips, revenue is recognized upon completion of\nthe particular trip. The performance of the service is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nRevenue related to marine transportation is recognized for time charters based on a per day rate. For contracted trips, revenue is recognized upon completion\nof the particular trip. The performance of the service is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nSulfur Services Segment\nRevenue from sulfur and fertilizer product sales is recognized when the customer takes title to the product. Delivery of product is invoiced as the transaction\noccurs and is generally paid within a month. Revenue from sulfur services is recognized as services are performed during each monthly period. The\nperformance of the service is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nSpecialty Products Segment\nNatural Gas Liquids (\"NGL\") revenue is recognized when title is transferred, which is generally when the product is delivered by truck, rail, or pipeline to\nthe Partnership's NGL customers or when the customer picks up the product from our facilities. When lubricants are sold by truck or rail, revenue is recognized\nwhen title is transferred, which is generally when the product leaves the Partnership's facility, but can vary based on the specific terms of the contract. Delivery\nof product is invoiced as the transaction occurs and is generally paid within a month.\nThe table below includes estimated minimum revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the\nend of the reporting period. The Partnership applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) and does not disclose information about remaining\nperformance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total\nTerminalling and storage\nThroughput and storage $ 11,060 $ 45,448 $ 46,749 $ 48,152 $ 49,662 $ 157,964 $ 359,035\nSulfur services\nProduct sales 1,909 7,636 6,661 492 — — 16,698\nService revenues 3,477 13,908 13,908 — — — 31,293\nSpecialty Products\nNGL product sales 1,639 6,501 3,776 — — — 11,916\nTotal $ 18,085 $ 73,493 $ 71,094 $ 48,644 $ 49,662 $ 157,964 $ 418,942\n11\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 5.

The margin\nis set every three months. All amounts outstanding at September 30, 2024 were at Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for\nrevolving loans that are SOFR loans currently ranges from 2.75% to 3.75%, and the applicable margin for revolving loans that are alternate base rate loans\ncurrently ranges from 1.75% to 2.75%. The applicable margin for SOFR borrowings at September 30, 2024 is 3.25%. The applicable margin for SOFR\nborrowings effective October 16, 2024, is 3.50%. The credit facility contains various covenants that limit the Partnership’s ability to make distributions; make\ncertain investments and acquisitions; enter into certain agreements; incur indebtedness; sell assets; and make certain amendments to the Partnership's omnibus\nagreement with Martin Resource Management Corporation (the \"Omnibus Agreement\").\n2 The Partnership was in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe Partnership paid cash interest in the amount of $24,805 and $25,291 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\nPartnership paid cash interest in the amount of $51,043 and $50,099 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capitalized interest\nwas $373 and $18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capitalized interest was $806 and $29 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n12\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 7. LEASES\nThe Partnership has numerous operating leases primarily for terminal facilities and transportation and other equipment. The leases generally provide that all\nexpenses related to the facilities and equipment are to be paid by the lessee.\nOperating lease Right-of-Use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at\ncommencement date. Because most of the Partnership's leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, the Partnership uses its imputed collateralized rate\nbased on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The estimated rate is based on a risk-free rate\nplus a risk-adjusted margin.\nOur leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 12 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which\ninclude options to terminate the leases within 1 year. The Partnership includes extension periods in its lease term if, at commencement, it is reasonably likely\nthat the Partnership will exercise the extension options.\nThe components of lease expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 5,483 $ 4,602 $ 15,603 $ 11,393\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets $ 4 $ — 7 6\nInterest on lease liabilities 1 — 2 —\nShort-term lease cost 1,537 1,256 4,036 4,331\nVariable lease cost 41 48 128 143\nTotal lease cost $ 7,066 $ 5,906 $ 19,776 $ 15,873\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 December 31, 2023\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 61,521 $ 60,359\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities included in \"Other accrued liabilities\" $ 17,216 $ 14,901\nOperating lease liabilities 44,549 45,684\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 61,765 $ 60,585\nFinance Leases\nProperty, plant and equipment, at cost $ 77 $ —\nAccumulated depreciation (7) —\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 70 $ —\nCurrent installments of finance lease obligations $ 14 $ —\nFinance lease obligations 58 —\nTotal finance lease obligations $ 72 $ —\n13\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Partnership incurred new operating leases, primarily related to land and marine transportation\nassets and renewed existing operating leases set to expire, primarily related to marine transportation assets.\nThe Partnership’s future minimum lease obligations as of September 30, 2024, consist of the following:\nOperating Leases\nYear 1 $ 21,084\nYear 2 18,827\nYear 3 14,770\nYear 4 9,182\nYear 5 2,824\nThereafter 4,425\nTotal 71,112\nLess amounts representing interest costs (9,347)\nTotal lease liability $ 61,765\nThe Partnership has non-cancelable revenue arrangements that are under the scope of ASC 842 whereby we have committed certain terminalling and storage\nassets in exchange for a minimum fee.

PARTNERS' CAPITAL (DEFICIT)\nAs of September 30, 2024, Partners’ capital (deficit) consisted of 39,001,086 common limited partner units, representing a 98% partnership interest,\nand a 2% general partner interest. Martin Resource Management Corporation, through subsidiaries, owned 6,114,532 of the Partnership's common limited\npartner units representing approximately 15.7% of the Partnership's outstanding common limited partner units. Martin Midstream GP LLC (\"MMGP\"), the\nPartnership's general partner, owns the 2% general partnership interest.\nThe partnership agreement of the Partnership (the \"Partnership Agreement\") contains specific provisions for the allocation of net income and losses to\neach of the partners for purposes of maintaining their respective partner capital accounts.\nImpact on Partners' Capital (Deficit) Related to Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control\nUnder ASC 805, assets and liabilities transferred between entities under common control are accounted for at the historical cost of those entities'\nultimate parent, in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Any difference in the amount paid by the transferee versus the historical cost of the assets\ntransferred is recorded as an adjustment to equity (contribution or distribution) by the transferee. This is in contrast with a business combination between\nunrelated parties, where assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date, with any excess of amounts paid over the fair value\nrepresenting goodwill. From time to time, the most recent being in 2019, the Partnership has entered into common control acquisitions from Martin Resource\nManagement Corporation. The consideration transferred totaling $552,058 exceeds the historical cost of the net assets received. This excess of the purchase\nprice over the historical cost of the net assets received has resulted in cumulative deemed distributions of $289,019 reflected as reductions to Partners' capital.\nDistributions of Available Cash\nThe Partnership distributes all of its available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) within 45 days after the end of each quarter to\nunitholders of record and to the general partner. Available cash is generally defined as all cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership on hand at the end of\neach quarter less the amount of cash reserves its general partner determines in its reasonable discretion is necessary or appropriate to: (i) provide for the proper\nconduct of the Partnership’s business; (ii) comply with applicable law, any debt instruments or other agreements; or (iii) provide funds for distributions to\nunitholders and the general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters, plus all cash on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter\nresulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter.\nNet Income per Unit\nThe Partnership follows the provisions of the FASB ASC 260-10 related to earnings per share, which addresses the application of the two-class\nmethod in determining income per unit for master limited partnerships having multiple classes of securities that may participate in partnership distributions\naccounted for as equity distributions. Undistributed earnings are allocated to the general partner and limited partners utilizing the contractual terms of the\nPartnership Agreement. When current period distributions are in excess of earnings, the excess distributions for the period are to be allocated to the general\npartner and limited partners based on their respective sharing of income and losses specified in the Partnership Agreement. Additionally, as required under\nFASB ASC 260-10-45-61A, unvested share-based payments that entitle employees to receive non-forfeitable distributions are considered participating\nsecurities, as defined in FASB ASC 260-10-20, for earnings per unit calculations.\nFor purposes of computing diluted net income per unit, the Partnership uses the more dilutive of the two-class and if-converted methods. Under the if-\nconverted method, the weighted-average number of subordinated units outstanding for the period is added to the weighted-average number of common units\noutstanding for purposes of computing basic net income per unit and the resulting amount is compared to the diluted net income per unit computed using the\ntwo-class method. The following is a reconciliation of net income allocated to the general partner and limited partners for purposes of calculating net income\nattributable to limited partners per unit:\n16\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ (3,319) $ (1,061) $ 3,734 $ (5,066)\nLess general partner’s interest in net income (loss):\nDistributions payable on behalf of general partner interest 4 4 12 12\nGeneral partner interest in undistributed income (loss) (70) (25) 63 (113)\nLess income (loss) allocable to unvested restricted units (14) (4) 14 (16)\nLimited partners’ interest in net income (loss) $ (3,239) $ (1,036) $ 3,645 $ (4,949)\nThe following are the unit amounts used to compute the basic and diluted earnings per limited partner unit for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September\n30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic weighted average limited partner units outstanding 38,832,222 38,772,266 38,831,064 38,771,451\nDilutive effect of restricted units issued — — 78,912 —\nTotal weighted average limited partner diluted units outstanding 38,832,222 38,772,266 38,909,976 38,771,451\nAll outstanding units were included in the computation of diluted earnings per unit and weighted based on the number of days such units were outstanding\nduring the periods presented. All common unit equivalents were antidilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the three months\nended September 30, 2024 because the limited partners were allocated a net loss in these periods.\nNOTE 10. UNIT BASED AWARDS - LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS\nThe Partnership recognizes compensation cost related to unit-based awards to both employees and non-employees in its consolidated and condensed\nfinancial statements in accordance with certain provisions of ASC 718. Amounts recognized in operating expense and selling, general, and administrative\nexpense in the consolidated and condensed financial statements with respect to these plans are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRestricted unit Awards\nEmployees $ — $ — $ — $ —\nNon-employee directors 42 37 145 127\nPhantom unit Awards\nEmployees 1,619 484 2,839 (691)\nNon-employee directors — — — —\nTotal unit-based compensation expense $ 1,661 $ 521 $ 2,984 $ (564)\n17\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nLong-Term Incentive Plans\nThe Partnership's general partner has long-term incentive plans for employees and directors of the general partner and its affiliates who perform services for\nthe Partnership.\nPhantom Unit Plan\nOn July 21, 2021, the board of directors of the general partner of the Partnership and the compensation committee of the general partner's board of\ndirectors (the \"Compensation Committee\") approved the Martin Midstream Partners L.P. 2021 Phantom Unit Plan (the “Plan”), effective as of the same date.\nThe Plan permits the awards of phantom units and phantom unit appreciation rights (collectively, \"phantom unit awards\") to any employee or non-employee\ndirector of the Partnership, including its executive officers. The awards may be time-based or performance-based and will be paid, if at all, in cash.\nThe award of a phantom unit entitles the participant to a cash payment equal to the value of the phantom unit on the vesting date or dates, which value\nis the fair market value of a common unit of the Partnership (a “Unit”) on such vesting date or dates. The award of a phantom unit appreciation right entitles the\nrecipient to a cash payment equal to the difference between the value of a phantom unit on the vesting date or dates in excess of the value assigned by the\nCompensation Committee to the phantom unit as of the grant date. Phantom units and phantom unit appreciation rights granted to participants do not confer\nupon participants any right to a Unit.\nOn July 21, 2021, the Compensation Committee approved forms of time-based award agreements for phantom units and phantom unit appreciation\nrights, both of which awards vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date. The grant date value of a phantom unit under a phantom unit appreciation\nright award is equal to the average of the closing price for a Unit during the 20 trading days immediately preceding the grant date of the award.\nGenerally, vesting of an award is subject to a participant remaining continuously employed with the Partnership through the vesting date. However, if\nprior to the vesting date (i) a participant is terminated without cause (as defined in the award agreement) or terminates employment after the participant has\nattained both the age of 65 and ten years of employment (“retirement-eligible”), a prorated portion of the award will vest and be paid in cash no later than the\n30th day following such termination date (subject to a six-month delay in payment for certain retirement-eligible participants) or (ii) there is a change in control\nof the Partnership (as defined in the Plan), the award will vest in full and be paid in cash no later than the 30th day following the date of the change of control;\nprovided, that the participant has been in continuous employment through the termination or change in control date, as applicable.\nOn July 21, 2021, 620,000 phantom units and 1,245,000 phantom unit appreciation rights were granted to employees of the general partner and its\naffiliates who perform services for the Partnership. On April 20, 2022, the board of directors of the general partner of the Partnership and the Compensation\nCommittee approved the First Amendment to the Plan, effective as of the same date, which amendment increased the total number of phantom units available\nfor grant under the Plan from 2,000,000 units to 5,000,000 units. On April 20, 2022, 365,000 phantom units and 1,097,500 phantom unit appreciation rights\nwere granted to employees of the general partner and its affiliates who perform services for the Partnership. On July 19, 2023, 1,179,500 phantom units and\n505,500 phantom unit appreciation rights were granted to employees of the general partner and its affiliates who perform services for the Partnership.\nPhantom unit awards are recorded in operating expense and selling, general and administrative expense based on the fair value of the vested portion of\nthe awards on the balance sheet date. The fair value of these awards is updated at each balance sheet date and changes in the fair value of the vested portions of\nthe awards are recorded as increases or decreases to compensation expense within operating expense and selling, general and administrative expense in the\nConsolidated and Condensed Statements of Operations. All of the Partnership's outstanding phantom unit awards at September 30, 2024, met the criteria to be\ntreated under liability classification in accordance with ASC 718, given that these awards will settle in cash on the vesting date.\nCompensation expense for the phantom awards is based on the fair value of the units as of the balance sheet date as further discussed below, and such\ncosts are recognized ratably over the service period of the awards. As the fair value of liability awards is required to be re-measured each period end, stock\ncompensation expense amounts recognized in future\n18\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nperiods for these awards will vary. The estimated future cash payments of these awards are presented as liabilities within \"Other current liabilities\" and \"Other\nlong-term obligations\" in the Consolidated and Condensed Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, there was a total of $3,493 of unrecognized\ncompensation costs related to non-vested phantom unit awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a remaining life of 1.69 years.\nThe fair value of the phantom unit awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation model as of the balance sheet date. The Monte Carlo valuation\nmodel is based on random projections of stock price paths and must be repeated numerous times to achieve a probabilistic assessment. Expected volatility was\ncalculated based on the historical volatility of the Partnership’s common units as well as set of peer companies.\nRestricted Unit Plan\nOn May 26, 2017, the unitholders of the Partnership approved the Martin Midstream Partners L.P. 2017 Restricted Unit Plan (the \"2017 LTIP\"). The\n2017 LTIP currently permits the grant of awards covering an aggregate of 3,000,000 common units, all of which can be awarded in the form of restricted units.\nThe 2017 LTIP is administered by the Compensation Committee.\nA restricted unit is a unit that is granted to grantees with certain vesting restrictions, which may be time-based and/or performance-based. Once these\nrestrictions lapse, the grantee is entitled to full ownership of the unit without restrictions. The Compensation Committee may determine to make grants under\nthe 2017 LTIP containing such terms as the Compensation Committee shall determine under the 2017 LTIP. With respect to time-based restricted units\n(\"TBRUs\"), the Compensation Committee will determine the time period over which restricted units granted to employees and directors will vest. The\nCompensation Committee may also award a percentage of restricted units with vesting requirements based upon the achievement of specified pre-established\nperformance targets (\"Performance Based Restricted Units\" or \"PBRUs\"). The performance targets may include, but are not limited to, the following: revenue\nand income measures, cash flow measures, net income before interest expense and income tax expense (\"EBIT\"), net income before interest expense, income\ntax expense, and depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), distribution coverage metrics, expense measures, liquidity measures, market measures, corporate\nsustainability metrics, and other measures related to acquisitions, dispositions, operational objectives and succession planning objectives. PBRUs are earned\nonly upon our achievement of an objective performance measure for the performance period. PBRUs which vest are payable in common units. Unvested units\ngranted under the 2017 LTIP may or may not participate in cash distributions depending on the terms of each individual award agreement.\nThe restricted units issued to directors generally vest in equal annual installments over a four-year period. Restricted units issued to employees\ngenerally vest in equal annual installments over three years of service. All of the Partnership's outstanding restricted unit awards at September 30, 2024, met the\ncriteria to be treated under equity classification.\nIn February 2024, the Partnership issued 28,760 TBRUs to each of the Partnership's three independent directors under the 2017 LTIP. These restricted\ncommon units vest in equal installments of 7,190 units on January 24, 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028.\n19\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nThe restricted units are valued at their fair value at the date of grant, which is equal to the market value of common units on such date.

The Partnership’s general partner’s ability, as general partner, to manage and operate the\nPartnership, and Martin Resource Management Corporation’s ownership as of September 30, 2024, of approximately 15.7% of the Partnership’s outstanding\nlimited partnership units, effectively gives Martin Resource Management Corporation the ability to veto some of the Partnership’s actions and to control the\nPartnership’s management.\nThe following is a description of the Partnership’s material related party agreements and transactions:\nOmnibus Agreement\nOmnibus Agreement. The Partnership and its general partner are parties to the Omnibus Agreement dated November 1, 2002, with Martin Resource\nManagement Corporation that governs, among other things, potential competition and indemnification obligations among the parties to the agreement, related\nparty transactions, the provision of general administration and support services by Martin Resource Management Corporation and the Partnership’s use of\ncertain Martin Resource Management Corporation trade names and trademarks.

The fees the Partnership charges Martin Resource Management Corporation\nare based on applicable market rates.\nMarine Fuel. The Partnership is a party to an agreement with Martin Resource Management Corporation dated November 1, 2002, under which Martin\nResource Management Corporation provides the Partnership with marine fuel from its locations in the Gulf of Mexico at a fixed rate in excess of the Platt’s\nU.S. Gulf Coast Index for #2 Fuel Oil. Under this agreement, the Partnership agreed to purchase all of its marine fuel requirements that occur in the areas\nserviced by Martin Resource Management Corporation.\nTerminal Services Agreements\nDiesel Fuel Terminal Services Agreement. Effective October 1, 2022, the Partnership entered into a third amended and restated terminalling services\nagreement under which it provides terminal services to Martin Energy Services LLC (“MES”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Martin Resource Management\nCorporation, for fuel distribution utilizing marine shore based terminals owned by the Partnership. This agreement amended the existing arrangement between\nthe Partnership and MES by eliminating any minimum throughput volume requirements and increasing the per gallon throughput fee. The primary term of this\nagreement expired on December 31, 2023, but will continue on a year to year basis until terminated by either party by giving at least 90 days’ written notice\nprior to the end of any term. Effective January 1, 2024, this agreement was amended to increase the throughput rate and to establish a minimum throughput\nvolume.\nMiscellaneous Terminal Services Agreements. The Partnership is currently party to several terminal services agreements and from time to time the\nPartnership may enter into other terminal service agreements for the purpose of providing terminal services to related parties. Individually, each of these\nagreements is immaterial but when considered in the aggregate they could be deemed material. These agreements are throughput based with a minimum\nvolume commitment. Generally, the fees due under these agreements are adjusted annually based on a price index.\nOther Agreements\nCross Tolling Agreement. The Partnership is a party to an amended and restated tolling agreement with Cross Oil Refining and Marketing, Inc. (\"Cross\")\ndated October 28, 2014, under which the Partnership processes crude oil into finished products, including naphthenic lubricants, distillates, asphalt and other\nintermediate cuts for Cross. The tolling agreement expires November 25, 2031. Under this tolling agreement, Cross agreed to process a minimum of 6,500\nbarrels per day of crude oil at the facility at a fixed price per barrel. Any additional barrels are processed at a modified price per barrel. In addition, Cross\nagreed to pay a monthly reservation fee and a periodic fuel surcharge fee based on certain parameters specified in the tolling agreement. Further, certain capital\nimprovements, to the extent requested by Cross, are reimbursed through a capital recovery fee. All of these fees (other than the fuel surcharge) are subject to\nescalation annually based upon the greater of 3% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index for a specified annual period.\nEast Texas Mack Leases.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Partnership is subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of\nmanagement, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Partnership.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Partnership received a demand from a customer in its lubricants packaging business for defense and indemnity in connection\nwith various lawsuits filed against it, which generally alleged that the customer engaged in unlawful and deceptive business practices in connection with its\nmarketing and advertising of its private label motor oil (the “Marketing Lawsuits”). The Partnership disputed and continues to dispute that it has any obligation\nto defend or indemnify the customer for the customer’s conduct. Accordingly, on January 7, 2016, the Partnership filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment\nin the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee (the “Tennessee Court”), under Case No. 16-0018-BC, requesting a judicial determination that the\nPartnership did not owe the customer the demanded defense and indemnity obligations (the “Litigation”). The Marketing Lawsuits pending in federal court\nagainst the customer were transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri under the consolidated case MDL No. 2709 for pretrial\nproceedings (the “Consolidated Lawsuits”). On March 1, 2017, at the joint request of the customer and the Partnership, the Tennessee Court administratively\nclosed the Litigation. In 2021, the customer settled the Consolidated Lawsuits. On December 17, 2021, at the request of the customer, the Tennessee Court\nreopened the Litigation and the customer asserted various counterclaims against the Partnership seeking, among other things, to recover its costs of defending\nand settling the Consolidated Lawsuits. At this time, we are unable to determine what ultimate exposure we may have in this matter, if any. The Partnership\nintends to vigorously defend the counterclaims asserted by the customer in the Litigation. The trial for the Litigation is expected to be held in the second half of\n2025.\nNOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Partnership uses a valuation framework based upon inputs that market participants use in pricing certain assets and liabilities. These inputs are classified\ninto two categories: observable inputs and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable\ninputs represent the Partnership's own market assumptions. Unobservable inputs are used only if observable inputs are unavailable or not reasonably available\nwithout undue cost and effort. The two types of inputs are further prioritized into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions and are not corroborated by market data.\nThe Partnership is required to disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates are set forth below for these financial\ninstruments. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument:\n• Accounts and other receivables, trade and other accounts payable, accrued interest payable, other accrued liabilities, income taxes payable and due\nfrom/to affiliates: The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments, and as such\nthese have been excluded from the table below. There is negligible credit risk associated with these instruments.\n• Current and non-current portion of long-term debt: The carrying amount of the credit facility approximates fair value due to the debt having a variable\ninterest rate and is in Level 2. The estimated fair value of the 2028 Notes is considered Level 2, as the fair value is based upon quoted prices for\nidentical liabilities in markets that are not active.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\nValue Value Value Value\n2028 Notes $ 385,272 $ 441,587 $ 381,965 $ 414,453\nTotal $ 385,272 $ 441,587 $ 381,965 $ 414,453\n27\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 15. INVESTMENT IN DSM SEMICHEM LLC\nOn October 19, 2022, Martin ELSA Investment LLC, the Partnership's affiliate, entered into definitive agreements with Samsung C&T America, Inc.\nand Dongjin USA, Inc., an affiliate of Dongjin Semichem Co., Ltd., to form DSM Semichem LLC (“DSM”). DSM will produce and distribute electronic level\nsulfuric acid (“ELSA”). By leveraging the Partnership's existing assets located in Plainview, Texas and installing additional facilities (the “ELSA Facility”) as\nrequired, DSM will produce ELSA that meets the strict quality standards required by the recent advances in semiconductor manufacturing. In addition to\nowning a 10% non-controlling interest in DSM, the Partnership will be the exclusive provider of feedstock to the ELSA Facility. The Partnership, through its\naffiliate MTI, will also provide land transportation services for the ELSA produced by DSM. On April 1, 2024, the Partnership contributed $6,500 in cash to\nDSM, which represents the cash contributions required pursuant to DSM's limited liability agreement for the Partnership's 10% non-controlling interest. Also,\nin conjunction with the formation of DSM, we contributed approximately 22 acres of land. The Partnership recognizes its 10% interest in DSM as \"Investment\nin DSM Semichem LLC\" on its Consolidated and Condensed Balance Sheets. The Partnership accounts for its ownership interest in DSM under the equity\nmethod of accounting.\nNOTE 16. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe Partnership's operations are conducted by its operating subsidiaries as it has no independent assets or operations. The Operating Partnership, the\nPartnership’s wholly-owned subsidiary, and the Partnership's other operating subsidiaries have issued in the past, and may issue in the future, unconditional\nguarantees of senior or subordinated debt securities of the Partnership. The guarantees that have been issued are full, irrevocable and unconditional and joint\nand several. In addition, the Operating Partnership may also issue senior or subordinated debt securities which, if issued, will be fully, irrevocably and\nunconditionally guaranteed by the Partnership. Substantially all of the Partnership's operating subsidiaries are subsidiary guarantors of its Senior Notes and any\nsubsidiaries other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor.\nNOTE 17. INCOME TAXES\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProvision for income taxes $ 1,066 $ 788 $ 3,634 $ 3,619\nThe operations of a partnership are generally not subject to income taxes, except for Texas margin tax, because its income is taxed directly to its\npartners. Current state income taxes attributable to the Texas margin tax relating to the operation of the Partnership of $270 and $120 were recorded in income\ntax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Current state income taxes attributable to the Texas margin tax relating to\nthe operation of the Partnership of $820 and $320 were recorded in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeferred taxes applicable to the Texas margin tax relating to the operation of the Partnership are immaterial.\nMTI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, is subject to income taxes due to its corporate structure (the \"Taxable Subsidiary\"). Total income\ntax expense of $796 and $668, related to the operation of the Taxable Subsidiary, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, resulted in an\neffective income tax rate (\"ETR\") of 33.36% and 23.96%, respectively. Total income tax expense of $2,814 and $3,299, related to the operation of the Taxable\nSubsidiary, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, resulted in an ETR of 25.17% and 24.88%, respectively.\nThe increase in the provision for income taxes and the ETR for the income taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily\ndue to an increase in permanent differences, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in the provision for income taxes during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a favorable true-up to state net operating loss carryforwards, compared to the same period in 2023. The\nincrease in the ETR for the income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes in\nthe current period, compared to the same period in 2023.\nA current federal income tax expense of $471 and $179, related to the operation of the Taxable Subsidiary, was recorded for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A current federal income tax expense of $2,047 and $666, related to the operation of the Taxable Subsidiary, was\nrecorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A current state income tax expense of $194 and $33, related to the operation of\nthe Taxable\n28\nMARTIN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in thousands, except where otherwise indicated)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nSubsidiary, was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A current state income tax expense of $610 and $311, related\nto the operation of the Taxable Subsidiary, was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWith respect to MTI, income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740 related to income\ntaxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying\namounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply\nto taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a\nchange in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nA deferred tax expense related to the MTI temporary differences of $131 and $456 was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. A deferred tax expense related to the MTI temporary differences of $157 and $2,322 was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. A net deferred tax asset of $10,043 and $10,200, related to the cumulative book and tax temporary differences, existed at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAll income tax positions taken for all open years are more likely than not to be sustained based upon their technical merit under applicable tax laws.\nNOTE 18. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nMerger Agreement. On May 24, 2024, Martin Resource Management Corporation filed an amendment to its Schedule 13D (the “13D Amendment”)\nwith the SEC disclosing that Martin Resource Management Corporation made a non-binding proposal to the Board, pursuant to which Martin Resource\nManagement Corporation would acquire all the outstanding common units of the Partnership not already owned by Martin Resource Management Corporation\nand its subsidiaries.\nOn October 3, 2024, Martin Resource Management Corporation, MRMC Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), the Partnership, and MMGP entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which\nMerger Sub will merge with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Martin Resource Management\nCorporation (the “Merger”).\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding common unit representing a limited partner\ninterest in the Partnership (each, a “Common Unit”) other than common units owned by Martin Resource Management Corporation and its subsidiaries,\nincluding MMGP (each, a “Public Common Unit”), will be converted into the right to receive $4.02 in cash without any interest thereon (the “Merger\nConsideration”). In connection with the Merger, (i) MMGP’s non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership and (ii) the common units owned by\nMartin Resource Management Corporation and its subsidiaries, in each case, shall not be cancelled, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration and shall remain outstanding following the Merger.\nImmediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, all restricted units, phantom units and phantom unit appreciation rights outstanding immediately\nprior to the effective time will fully vest, and each holder of such units and appreciation rights will receive an amount equal to the Merger Consideration with\nrespect to each such unit or appreciation right that becomes vested pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval of the unitholders.\nQuarterly Distribution. On October 16, 2024, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.005 per common unit for the third quarter of\n2024, or $0.020 per common unit on an annualized basis, which will be paid on November 14, 2024, to unitholders of record as of November 7, 2024.\n29\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated and condensed financial\nstatements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report.\nOverview\nWe are a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S. Our four primary\nbusiness lines include:\n• Terminalling, processing, and storage services for petroleum products and by-products;\n• Land and marine transportation services for petroleum products and by-products, chemicals, and specialty products;\n• Sulfur and sulfur-based products processing, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution; and\n• Marketing, distribution, and transportation services for natural gas liquids and blending and packaging services for specialty lubricants and grease.\nThe petroleum products and by-products we collect, transport, store and market are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas\ncompanies who often turn to third parties, such as us, for the transportation and disposition of these products. In addition to these major and independent oil\nand gas companies, our primary customers include independent refiners, large chemical companies, and other wholesale purchasers of these products. We\noperate primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S. This region is a major hub for petroleum refining, natural gas gathering and processing, and support\nservices for the exploration and production industry.\nWe were formed in 2002 by Martin Resource Management Corporation, a privately-held company whose initial predecessor was incorporated in 1951 as a\nsupplier of products and services to drilling rig contractors. Since then, Martin Resource Management Corporation has expanded its operations through\nacquisitions and internal expansion initiatives as its management identified and capitalized on the needs of producers and purchasers of petroleum products and\nby-products and other bulk liquids. Martin Resource Management Corporation is an important supplier and customer of ours. As of September 30, 2024,\nMartin Resource Management Corporation owned 15.7% of our total outstanding common limited partner units and 100% of MMGP Holdings, LLC\n(\"Holdings\"), which is the sole member of Martin Midstream GP LLC (\"MMGP\"), our general partner. MMGP owns a 2.0% general partner interest in us.\nWe entered into the Omnibus Agreement that governs, among other things, potential competition and indemnification obligations among the parties to the\nagreement, related party transactions, the provision of general administration and support services by Martin Resource Management Corporation and our use of\ncertain of Martin Resource Management Corporation’s trade names and trademarks. Under the terms of the Omnibus Agreement, the employees of Martin\nResource Management Corporation are responsible for conducting our business and operating our assets.\nMartin Resource Management Corporation has operated our business since our inception in 2002. Martin Resource Management Corporation began\noperating our NGL business in the 1950s and our sulfur business in the 1960s. It began our land transportation business in the early 1980s and our marine\ntransportation business in the late 1980s. It entered into our fertilizer and terminalling and storage businesses in the early 1990s.\nSignificant Recent Developments\nMerger Agreement. On May 24, 2024, Martin Resource Management Corporation filed an amendment to its Schedule 13D with the SEC disclosing\nthat Martin Resource Management Corporation made a non-binding proposal to the Board, pursuant to which Martin Resource Management Corporation\nwould acquire all the outstanding common units of the Partnership not already owned by Martin Resource Management Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nOn October 3, 2024, Martin Resource Management Corporation, Merger Sub, the Partnership, and MMGP, entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant\nto which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Martin Resource Management\nCorporation.

During May 2024, we experienced a casualty loss of $0.5 million that represents two separate insurance deductibles under\nour marine transportation protection and indemnity coverage policy and our hull coverage policy stemming from a bridge allision in Galveston, Texas.\nElectronic Level Sulfuric Acid Joint Venture. On October 19, 2022, Martin ELSA Investment LLC, our affiliate, entered into definitive agreements\nwith Samsung C&T America, Inc. and Dongjin USA, Inc., an affiliate of Dongjin Semichem Co., Ltd., to form DSM Semichem LLC (“DSM”). DSM will\nproduce and distribute electronic level sulfuric acid (“ELSA”). By leveraging our existing assets located in Plainview, Texas and installing additional facilities\n(the “ELSA Facility”) as required, DSM will produce ELSA that meets the strict quality standards required by the recent advances in semiconductor\nmanufacturing. In addition to owning a 10% non-controlling interest in DSM, we will be the exclusive provider of feedstock to the ELSA Facility. We, through\nour affiliate MTI, will also provide land transportation services for the ELSA produced by DSM. We expect to fund approximately $27.0 million in aggregate\ncapital expenditures in connection with this joint venture. On April 1, 2024, we contributed $6.5 million to DSM, which represents the cash contribution\nrequired pursuant to DSM's limited liability agreement for our 10% non-controlling interest. As of September 30, 2024, we have funded approximately $26.4\nmillion toward ELSA related project costs.\nSubsequent Events\nQuarterly Distribution. On October 16, 2024, we declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.005 per common unit for the third quarter of 2024, or\n$0.020 per common unit on an annualized basis, which will be paid on November 14, 2024, to unitholders of record as of November 7, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the historical consolidated and condensed financial statements\nincluded elsewhere herein. We prepared these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. We routinely evaluate these estimates, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we\nconsider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Our results may differ from these estimates, and any effects on our business, financial position or results of\noperations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Changes in\nthese estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See the \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" section\nin \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies\" in Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on\nFebruary 21, 2024.\nOur Relationship with Martin Resource Management Corporation\nMartin Resource Management Corporation is engaged in the following principal business activities:\n• distributing asphalt, marine fuel and other liquids;\n• providing marine bunkering and other shore-based marine services in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida;\n• operating a crude oil gathering business in Stephens, Arkansas;\n• providing crude oil gathering and marketing services of base oils, asphalt, and distillate products in Smackover, Arkansas;\n• providing crude oil marketing and transportation from the well head to the end market;\n• operating an environmental consulting company;\n• operating a butane optimization business;\n• supplying employees and services for the operation of our business; and\n31\n• operating, solely for our account, the asphalt facilities in Hondo, South Houston and Port Neches, Texas, and Omaha, Nebraska.\nWe are and will continue to be closely affiliated with Martin Resource Management Corporation as a result of the following relationships.\nOwnership\nMartin Resource Management Corporation owns approximately 15.7% of the outstanding limited partner units and indirectly owns 100% of MMGP, our\ngeneral partner, through its 100% interest in Holdings, which is the sole member of MMGP. MMGP owns a 2% general partner interest in us.\nManagement\nMartin Resource Management Corporation directs our business operations through its ownership interests in and control of our general partner. We\nbenefit from our relationship with Martin Resource Management Corporation through access to a significant pool of management expertise and established\nrelationships throughout the energy industry. We do not have employees. Martin Resource Management Corporation employees are responsible for conducting\nour business and operating our assets on our behalf.\nRelated Party Agreements\nThe Omnibus Agreement requires us to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for all direct expenses it incurs or payments it makes on\nour behalf or in connection with the operation of our business. We reimbursed Martin Resource Management Corporation for $46.2 million of direct costs and\nexpenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $43.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We reimbursed Martin\nResource Management Corporation for $128.4 million of direct costs and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $122.7 million\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There is no monetary limitation on the amount we are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management\nCorporation for direct expenses.\nIn addition to the direct expenses, under the Omnibus Agreement, we are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for indirect\ngeneral and administrative and corporate overhead expenses. In each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Conflicts Committee\napproved reimbursement amounts of $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. In each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Conflicts\nCommittee approved reimbursement amounts of $10.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively. The Conflicts Committee will review and approve future\nadjustments in the reimbursement amount for indirect expenses, if any, annually. These indirect expenses covered the centralized corporate functions Martin\nResource Management Corporation provides for us, such as accounting, treasury, clerical, engineering, legal, billing, information technology, administration of\ninsurance, general office expenses and employee benefit plans and other general corporate overhead functions we share with Martin Resource Management\nCorporation’s retained businesses. The Omnibus Agreement also contains significant non-compete provisions and indemnity obligations. Martin Resource\nManagement Corporation also licenses certain of its trademarks and trade names to us under the Omnibus Agreement.\nThese additional related party agreements include, but are not limited to, a master transportation services agreement, marine transportation agreements,\nterminal services agreements, and a tolling agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Agreement, we are prohibited from entering into certain material\nagreements with Martin Resource Management Corporation without the approval of the Conflicts Committee.\nFor a more comprehensive discussion concerning the Omnibus Agreement and the other agreements that we have entered into with Martin Resource\nManagement Corporation, please refer to \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" set forth in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.\n32\nCommercial\nWe have been and anticipate that we will continue to be both a significant customer and supplier of products and services offered by Martin Resource\nManagement Corporation. In the aggregate, the impact of related party transactions included in total costs and expenses accounted for approximately 31% and\n29% of our total costs and expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the aggregate, the impact of related party\ntransactions included in total costs and expenses accounted for approximately 29% and 23% of our total costs and expenses during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCorrespondingly, Martin Resource Management Corporation is one of our significant customers. Our sales to Martin Resource Management\nCorporation accounted for approximately 15% and 15% of our total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our sales\nto Martin Resource Management Corporation accounted for approximately 15% and 13% of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\nFor a more comprehensive discussion concerning the agreements that we have entered into with Martin Resource Management Corporation, please\nrefer to \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\" set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.\nApproval and Review of Related Party Transactions\nIf we contemplate entering into a transaction, other than a routine or in the ordinary course of business transaction, in which a related person will have\na direct or indirect material interest, the proposed transaction is submitted for consideration to the board of directors of our general partner or to our\nmanagement, as appropriate. If the board of directors of our general partner is involved in the approval process, it determines whether to refer the matter to the\nConflicts Committee of our general partner's board of directors, as constituted under our limited partnership agreement. If a matter is referred to the Conflicts\nCommittee, the Conflicts Committee obtains information regarding the proposed transaction from management and determines whether to engage independent\nlegal counsel or an independent financial advisor to advise the members of the committee regarding the transaction. If the Conflicts Committee retains such\ncounsel or financial advisor, it considers such advice and, in the case of a financial advisor, such advisor’s opinion as to whether the transaction is fair and\nreasonable to us and to our unitholders.\n33\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo assist management in assessing our business, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation\nand amortization (\"EBITDA\"), adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), Credit Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), distributable cash flow available to\ncommon unitholders (“Distributable Cash Flow”), and free cash flow after growth capital expenditures and principal payments under finance lease obligations\n(\"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\"). Our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements other than our financial statements prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP to analyze our performance.\nCertain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity's financial\nperformance, such as cost of capital and historical costs of depreciable assets.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before unit-based compensation expenses, gains\nand losses on the disposition of property, plant and equipment, impairment and other similar non-cash adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a\nsupplemental performance and liquidity measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks,\nresearch analysts, and others, to assess:\n• the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis;\n• the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness, and make cash distributions to our unitholders; and\n• our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing\nmethods or capital structure.\nWe define Credit Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA excluding net income (loss) and the lower of cost or net realizable value and other non-cash\nadjustments associated with the butane optimization business, which we exited during the second quarter of 2023. Credit Adjusted EBITDA is used as a\nsupplemental performance and liquidity measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks,\nresearch analysts, and others to provide additional information regarding the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the\nPartnership’s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe GAAP measures most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA are net income (loss) and net cash provided by\n(used in) operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income\n(loss), operating income (loss), net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with\nGAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may\nnot calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nAdjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. Because we have borrowed money to\nfinance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate cash available for distribution. Because we have capital\nassets, depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs. Therefore, any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations.\nTo compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as\ndetermined under GAAP, as well as adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our overall performance.\nDistributable Cash Flow. We define Distributable Cash Flow as Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities less cash received (plus cash\npaid) for closed commodity derivative positions included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), plus changes in operating assets and liabilities\nwhich (provided) used cash, less maintenance capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs. Distributable Cash Flow is a significant performance measure\nused by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash\nflows generated by us to the cash distributions we expect to pay unitholders. Distributable Cash Flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders\nsince it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not\nwe are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates. Distributable Cash Flow is also a quantitative\nstandard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally\ndetermined by the unit's yield, which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Distributable Cash Flow less growth capital expenditures and principal payments\nunder finance lease obligations. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a significant performance\n34\nmeasure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements and represents how much cash flow a business generates during a specified\ntime period after accounting for all capital expenditures, including expenditures for growth and maintenance capital projects. We believe that Adjusted Free\nCash Flow is important to investors, lenders, commercial banks and research analysts since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing\nin additional capital projects, paying distributions, and similar matters. Our calculation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow may or may not be comparable to similarly\ntitled measures used by other entities.\nThe GAAP measure most directly comparable to Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow is Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating\nActivities. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, Net Income (Loss),\nOperating Income (Loss), Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities, or any other measure of liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\nDistributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow have important limitations because they exclude some items that affect Net Income (Loss), Operating\nIncome (Loss), and Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate these non-GAAP metrics in the same manner. To compensate for these\nlimitations, we believe that it is important to consider Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities determined under GAAP, as well as Distributable\nCash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, to evaluate our overall liquidity.\nThe following tables reconcile the non-GAAP financial measurements used by management to our most directly comparable GAAP measures for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which represents EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, Credit Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow,\nand adjusted free cash flow:\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Credit Adjusted EBITDA\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nNet income (loss) $ (3,319) $ (1,061) $ 3,734 $ (5,066)\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense 14,592 14,994 42,811 45,914\nIncome tax expense 1,066 788 3,634 3,619\nDepreciation and amortization 12,608 12,223 37,944 37,671\nEBITDA 24,947 26,944 88,123 82,138\nAdjustments:\nGain on disposition or sale of property, plant and equipment (159) (811) (1,320) (1,096)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt — — — 5,121\nEquity in (earnings) loss of DSM Semichem LLC 314 — 314 —\nLower of cost or net realizable value and other non-cash adjustments — — — (12,850)\nUnit-based compensation 42 37 145 127\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 25,144 $ 26,170 $ 87,262 $ 73,440\nAdjustments:\nLess: net loss associated with butane optimization business — — — 2,255\nPlus: lower of cost or net realizable value and other non-cash adjustments — $ — — 12,850\nCredit Adjusted EBITDA $ 25,144 $ 26,170 $ 87,262 $ 88,545\n35\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Adjusted EBITDA, Credit Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow, and Adjusted\nFree Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (15,753) $ 7,291 $ 6,184 $ 106,065\nInterest expense 1 13,220 13,623 38,700 41,108\nCurrent income tax expense 935 333 3,477 1,297\nLower of cost or net realizable value and other non-cash adjustments — — — (12,850)\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities which (provided) used cash:\nAccounts and other receivables, inventories, and other current assets 22,489 (5,983) 32,128 (98,485)\nTrade, accounts and other payables, and other current liabilities 4,032 11,155 7,474 35,285\nOther 221 (249) (701) 1,020\nAdjusted EBITDA 25,144 26,170 87,262 73,440\nAdjustments:\nLess: net loss associated with butane optimization business — — — 2,255\nPlus: lower of cost or net realizable value and other non-cash adjustments — — — 12,850\nCredit Adjusted EBITDA 25,144 26,170 87,262 88,545\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense (14,592) (14,994) (42,811) (45,914)\nIncome tax expense (1,066) (788) (3,634) (3,619)\nDeferred income taxes 131 455 157 2,322\nAmortization of debt discount 600 600 1,800 1,600\nAmortization of deferred debt issuance costs 772 771 2,311 3,206\nPayments for plant turnaround costs (2,894) (1,706) (9,599) (2,367)\nMaintenance capital expenditures (5,738) (5,516) (17,949) (19,588)\nDistributable cash flow 2,357 4,992 17,537 24,185\nPrincipal payments under finance lease obligations (4) — (5) (9)\nInvestment in DSM Semichem LLC — — (6,938) —\nExpansion capital expenditures (3,903) (3,444) (15,584) (6,126)\nAdjusted free cash flow $ (1,550) $ 1,548 $ (4,990) $ 18,050\n1 Net of amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, which are included in interest expense but not included in net cash provided by operating activities.\n36\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, have been derived from our consolidated and condensed\nfinancial statements.\nWe evaluate segment performance on the basis of operating income, which is derived by subtracting cost of products sold, operating expenses, selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense from revenues. The following table sets forth our operating revenues and\noperating income by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for these interim periods are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results of operations which might be expected for the entire year.\nOur consolidated and condensed results of operations are presented on a comparative basis below. There are certain items of income and expense\nwhich we do not allocate on a segment basis. These items, including interest expense and indirect selling, general and administrative expenses, are discussed\nfollowing the comparative discussion of our results within each segment.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nOperating Operating Operating\nIntersegment Revenues Income (Loss) Income (Loss)\nOperating Revenues after Operating Intersegment after\nRevenues Eliminations Eliminations Income (Loss) Eliminations Eliminations\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands)\n2024\nTerminalling and storage $ 24,414 $ (1,852) $ 22,562 $ 2,675 $ (1,761) $ 914\nTransportation 60,196 (3,690) 56,506 8,583 (3,725) 4,858\nSulfur services 24,660 — 24,660 1,254 3,465 4,719\nSpecialty products 67,225 (19) 67,206 3,881 2,021 5,902\nIndirect selling, general and\nadministrative — — — (3,742) — (3,742)\nTotal $ 176,495 $ (5,561) $ 170,934 $ 12,651 $ — $ 12,651\nOperating Operating Operating\nIntersegment Revenues Income (Loss) Income (Loss)\nOperating Revenues after Operating Intersegment after\nRevenues Eliminations Eliminations Income (Loss) Eliminations Eliminations\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands)\n2023\nTerminalling and storage $ 23,973 $ (1,771) $ 22,202 $ 3,107 $ (1,750) $ 1,357\nTransportation 58,541 (3,318) 55,223 6,677 (3,354) 3,323\nSulfur services 32,577 — 32,577 2,743 3,250 5,993\nSpecialty products 66,720 (25) 66,695 6,014 1,854 7,868\nIndirect selling, general and\nadministrative — — — (3,837) — (3,837)\nTotal $ 181,811 $ (5,114) $ 176,697 $ 14,704 $ — $ 14,704\n37\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nOperating Operating Operating\nIntersegment Revenues Income (Loss) Income (Loss)\nOperating Revenues after Operating Intersegment after\nRevenues Eliminations Eliminations Income (Loss) Eliminations Eliminations\nNine Months Ended September\n(In thousands)\n30, 2024\nTerminalling and storage $ 73,101 $ (5,647) $ 67,454 $ 9,634 $ (5,447) $ 4,187\nTransportation 183,705 (11,216) 172,489 26,450 (11,324) 15,126\nSulfur services 95,534 (1) 95,533 12,402 10,218 22,620\nSpecialty products 200,888 (69) 200,819 13,384 6,553 19,937\nIndirect selling, general and\nadministrative — — — (11,397) — (11,397)\nTotal $ 553,228 $ (16,933) $ 536,295 $ 50,473 $ — $ 50,473\nOperating Operating Operating\nIntersegment Revenues Income (Loss) Income (Loss)\nOperating Revenues after Operating Intersegment after\nRevenues Eliminations Eliminations Income (Loss) Eliminations Eliminations\nNine Months Ended September\n(In thousands)\n30, 2023\nTerminalling and storage $ 71,798 $ (7,054) $ 64,744 $ 10,661 $ (7,004) $ 3,657\nTransportation 178,875 (13,179) 165,696 25,135 (13,288) 11,847\nSulfur services 108,586 — 108,586 12,582 9,308 21,890\nSpecialty products 277,895 (59) 277,836 13,089 10,984 24,073\nIndirect selling, general and\nadministrative — — — (11,929) — (11,929)\nTotal $ 637,154 $ (20,292) $ 616,862 $ 49,538 $ — $ 49,538\n38\nTerminalling and Storage Segment\nComparative Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nPercent\n2024 2023 Variance Change\n(In thousands, except BBL per day)\nRevenues $ 24,414 $ 23,973 $ 441 2 %\nCost of products sold 23 23 — — %\nOperating expenses 14,857 15,078 (221) (1)%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 1,130 628 502 80 %\nDepreciation and amortization 5,695 5,102 593 12 %\n2,709 3,142 (433) (14)%\nLoss on disposition or sale of property, plant and equipment (34) (35) 1 3 %\nOperating income $ 2,675 $ 3,107 $ (432) (14)%\nShore-based throughput volumes (gallons) 42,242 40,655 1,587 4 %\nSmackover refinery throughput volumes (guaranteed minimum BBL per day) 6,500 6,500 — — %\nRevenues.

Indirect selling, general and\nadministrative expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of\ndecreases in overhead expenses allocated from Martin Resource Management Corporation of $0.4 million and employee-related expenses of $0.1 million.\nMartin Resource Management Corporation allocates to us a portion of its indirect selling, general and administrative expenses for services such as\naccounting, legal, treasury, clerical, billing, information technology, administration of insurance, engineering, general office expense and employee benefit\nplans and other general corporate overhead functions we share with Martin Resource Management Corporation retained businesses. This allocation is based on\nthe percentage of time spent by Martin Resource Management Corporation personnel that provide such centralized services. GAAP also permits other methods\nfor allocation of these expenses, such as basing the allocation on the percentage of revenues contributed by a segment. The allocation of these expenses\nbetween Martin Resource Management Corporation and us is subject to a number of judgments and estimates, regardless of the method used. We can provide\nno assurances that our method of allocation, in the past or in the future, is or will\n46\nbe the most accurate or appropriate method of allocation for these expenses. Other methods could result in a higher allocation of selling, general and\nadministrative expenses to us, which would reduce our net income.\nUnder the Omnibus Agreement, we are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for indirect general and administrative and\ncorporate overhead expenses.

Set forth below is a description of our cash flows for the periods indicated.\nCash Flows - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table details the cash flow changes between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nPercent\n2024 2023 Variance Change\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 6,184 $ 106,065 $ (99,881) (94)%\nInvesting activities (49,642) (22,478) (27,164) (121)%\nFinancing activities 43,460 (83,578) 127,038 152 %\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 2 $ 9 $ (7) (78)%\nNet cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes\nan increase in operating results and other non-cash charges of $1.2 million. This increase was offset by an unfavorable variance in cash flows associated with\nchanges in working capital of $101.1 million, primarily associated with the reduction in working capital associated with the exit of the butane optimization\nbusiness.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased $27.2 million. An\nincrease in cash used of $16.0 million resulted from higher payments for capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs in 2024. Further, investments in\nunconsolidated entities increased $6.9 million, while net proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment decreased $4.2 million.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nincreased primarily as a result of an decrease in borrowings of long-term debt of $293.4 million, offset by a decrease in repayments of long-term debt of $406.2\nmillion. Additionally, payments of debt issuance costs decreased $14.2 million.\nTotal Contractual Obligations\nA summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2024, is as follows:\nPayments due by period\nTotal Less than 1-3 3-5 Due\nType of Obligation Obligation One Year Years Years Thereafter\nCredit facility $ 86,500 $ — $ 86,500 $ — $ —\n11.5% senior secured notes, due 2028 400,000 — — 400,000 —\nOperating leases 71,112 21,084 33,597 12,006 4,425\nFinance lease obligations 72 14 31 27 —\nInterest payable on finance lease obligations 11 4 6 1 —\nInterest payable on fixed long-term debt obligations 154,426 46,000 92,000 16,426 —\nTotal contractual cash obligations $ 712,121 $ 67,102 $ 212,134 $ 428,460 $ 4,425\nThe interest payable under our credit facility is not reflected in the above table because such amounts depend on the\noutstanding balances and interest rates, which vary from time to time.\n48\nLetters of Credit. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding irrevocable letters of credit in the amount of $9.2 million, which were issued under our\ncredit facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nDescription of Our Indebtedness\nCredit Facility\nAt September 30, 2024, we maintained a $150.0 million credit facility that matures on February 8, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had $86.5\nmillion outstanding under the credit facility and $9.2 million of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit, leaving a maximum available amount to be borrowed\nunder our credit facility for future revolving credit borrowings and letters of credit of $54.4 million. After giving effect to our then current borrowings, letters\nof credit, and the financial covenants contained in our credit facility, we had the ability to borrow approximately $54.4 million in additional amounts thereunder\nas of September 30, 2024.\nThe credit facility is used for ongoing working capital needs and general partnership purposes, and to finance permitted investments, acquisitions and\ncapital expenditures. The level of outstanding draws on our credit facility from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 ranged from a low of $40.5\nmillion to a high of $102.5 million.\nThe applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings at September 30, 2024 is 3.25%. The applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings\neffective October 16, 2024 is 3.50%.\nFor a description of our credit facility, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Description of\nOur Long-Term Debt\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.\n2028 Notes\nFor a description of our 2028 Notes, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -\nDescription of Our Long-Term Debt\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nHistorically, we have generally satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our debt service obligations and capital expenditures with cash\ngenerated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility.\nOn September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.06 million and available borrowing capacity of $54.4 million under our credit facility with\n$86.5 million of borrowings outstanding. After giving effect to our then current borrowings, letters of credit, and the financial covenants contained in our credit\nfacility, we had the ability to borrow approximately $54.4 million in additional amounts thereunder as of September 30, 2024.\nWe expect that our primary sources of liquidity to meet operating expenses, service our indebtedness, pay distributions to our unitholders and fund capital\nexpenditures will be provided by cash flows generated by our operations, borrowings under our credit facility and access to the debt and equity capital\nmarkets. Our ability to generate cash from operations will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to certain risks. For a discussion of\nsuch risks, please read \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. In addition,\ndue to the covenants in our credit facility, our financial and operating performance impacts the amount we are permitted to borrow under that facility.\nWe are in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024, and expect to be in compliance for the next twelve months.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our credit facility due to the variable interest rate and may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce this variable\nrate risk.\n49\nSeasonality\nA substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on sales prices of products, particularly NGLs and fertilizers, which fluctuate in part based on winter and\nspring weather conditions. The demand for NGLs is strongest during the winter heating season. The demand for fertilizers is strongest during the early spring\nplanting season. However, our Terminalling and Storage and Transportation business segments and the molten sulfur business are typically not impacted by\nseasonal fluctuations and a significant portion of our net income is derived from our Terminalling and Storage, Sulfur Services and Transportation business\nsegments. Further, extraordinary weather events, such as hurricanes, have in the past, and could in the future, impact our Terminalling and Storage, Sulfur\nServices, and Transportation business segments.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Inflation may increase the cost\nto acquire or replace property, plant and equipment. It may also increase the costs of labor and supplies. In the future, increasing energy prices for products\nconsumed by our operations, such as diesel fuel, natural gas, chemicals, and other supplies, could adversely affect our results of operations. An increase in price\nof these products would increase our operating expenses which could adversely affect net income. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to pass\nalong increased operating expenses to our customers.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations\nare conducted.\nOn June 15, 2024, the Partnership had a spill of less than 2,500 barrels of crude oil originating from the Partnership’s transfer pipeline, which connects\nour Sandyland Terminal to our refinery located in Smackover, Union County, Arkansas. The Partnership is working closely with the U.S Environmental\nProtection Agency (“EPA”), Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment (“ADEE”), and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission to respond to the spill.\nThe Partnership has dedicated the necessary resources, equipment, and personnel to conduct and expedite oil recovery and cleanup activities. As of October 15,\n2024, the Partnership’s response efforts have moved from emergency response status with the EPA to remediation status, which is to be overseen by the ADEE.\nA claim related to the crude oil spill has been made with and accepted by, subject to a reservation of rights, the Partnership’s insurance carriers. The\nPartnership’s deductibles under the applicable insurance policies total $1.5 million and such deductible expense has been recorded by the Partnership in the\nConsolidated and Condensed Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWe incurred no material environmental costs, liabilities or expenditures to mitigate or eliminate environmental contamination during the nine months\nended September 30, 2023.\n50\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThe Partnership is exposed to commodity risk and interest rate risk in its normal business activities. The following disclosures about market risk\nprovide an update to, and should be read in conjunction with, “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” set forth in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.\nCommodity Risk. The Partnership from time to time uses derivatives to manage the risk of commodity price fluctuation. Commodity risk is the\nadverse effect on the value of a liability or future purchase that results from a change in commodity price. We have established a hedging policy and monitor\nand manage the commodity market risk associated with potential commodity risk exposure. In addition, we focus on utilizing counterparties for these\ntransactions whose financial condition is appropriate for the credit risk involved in each specific transaction. We had no outstanding hedging positions as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nInterest Rate Risk. We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our credit facility, which had a weighted-average interest rate of 8.44% as\nof September 30, 2024. Based on the amount of unhedged floating rate debt owed by us on September 30, 2024, the impact of a 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates on this amount of debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately $0.9 million\nannually.\nWe are not exposed to changes in interest rates with respect to our 2028 Notes as these obligations are at a fixed rate. Based on the quoted prices for\nidentical liabilities in markets that are not active at September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the 2028 Notes was $441.6 million. Market risk is estimated\nas the potential decrease in fair value of our long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. Such an\nincrease in interest rates at September 30, 2024, would result in a $10.1 million decrease in the fair value of our 2028 Notes.\n51\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and\nwith the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our general partner, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based\non that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our general partner concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective, as of the end of the period covered by this report, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during our\nmost recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n52\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are subject to certain legal proceedings, claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although we cannot\npredict the outcomes of these legal proceedings, these actions, in the aggregate, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of\noperations or liquidity. A description of our legal proceedings is included in \"Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies\", and is\nincorporated herein by reference.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes to the Partnership's risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed\nwith the SEC on February 21, 2024, except as follows.\nThe Merger is subject to conditions, including some conditions that may not be satisfied on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Merger, or\nsignificant delays in completing the Merger, could negatively affect our business and financial results and the trading prices of our common units.\nThe completion of the Merger is not assured and is subject to certain risks, including the risk that certain conditions of the Merger Agreement, such as\nrequired regulatory approvals and the approval of our unitholders, some of which are beyond the parties’ control, are not satisfied or waived, which may\nprevent, delay or otherwise result in the Merger not occurring. The Merger Agreement contains conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, would result in the\nMerger not occurring, even though our common unitholders may have voted in favor of the Merger-related proposals presented to them. Failure to complete, or\nsignificant delays in completing, the Merger with Martin Resource Management Corporation could negatively affect the price of our common units and may\nhave a material adverse impact on our subsequent financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits regarding the Merger, which could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition or prevent or delay\ncompletion of the Merger.\nOur directors and officers may be subject to lawsuits relating to the Merger. While we will evaluate and defend against any actions vigorously, the\ncosts of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Failure to\ncomplete, or significant delays in completing, the Merger could negatively affect the price of our common units and may have a material adverse impact on our\nsubsequent financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on the Partnership, its subsidiaries and the companies that do business with us may have an adverse effect\non us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and suppliers until the Merger is completed and for a period of\ntime thereafter, and could cause those that transact with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us.\nWe may incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger.\nWe and Martin Resource Management Corporation expect to incur nonrecurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Merger.\nNonrecurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees, proxy solicitation costs and\nprinting costs.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under specified circumstances, be responsible for a termination fee of $2.5 million or the reimbursement\nof Martin Resource Management Corporation’s expenses in an amount up to $5.0 million.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under specified circumstances, be required to pay a termination fee of $2.5 million or make a\npayment of up to $5.0 million in respect of Martin Resource Management Corporation’s expenses. If such termination fee or reimbursement expenses are\npayable, the payment of any such amount could have an adverse consequence to the financial condition and operations of the party responsible for such\npayment.\n53\nThe Merger is a taxable transaction and the resulting tax liability of our common unitholders, if any, will depend on each such common unitholder’s\nparticular situation.\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for common units of the Partnership pursuant to the Merger will be treated as a taxable sale by such common\nunitholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of ordinary income and capital gain or loss recognized by each common unitholder in the Merger\nwill vary depending on each common unitholder’s particular situation, including:\n• the amount of cash received by the common unitholder as consideration in the Merger;\n• the adjusted tax basis of the common units exchanged by the common unitholder in the Merger;\n• the amount of depreciation and amortization deductions previously allocated to the common unitholder; and\n• the amount of any suspended passive losses that may be available to the common unitholder in respect of its common units to offset a portion of any\nincome or gain recognized by the common unitholder.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Partnership adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6.
