(Nasdaq: VCYT), a leading cancer diagnostics company, today announced that its market-leading Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier is the only gene expression test to be included in version 1 of the 2025 NCCN* Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) as part of the updated “Advanced Tools” table located in the Principles of Risk Stratification and Biomarkers section (PROS-H) . \n\n“The Decipher Prostate test’s performance and clinical utility have been demonstrated in many dozens of peer-reviewed, published studies, including analyses of samples from multiple prospective, Phase 3 clinical trials, making it the most validated test of its kind for prostate cancer,” said Phil Febbo, M.D., Veracyte’s chief scientific officer and chief medical officer. “We believe the Decipher Prostate test’s unique status in the NCCN guidelines stems from the evidence generated through our commitment to research and our numerous collaborations with leading prostate cancer researchers around the world.” \n\nThe Decipher Prostate test is a whole-transcriptome-derived, 22-gene signature that clinicians use to help assess the likelihood of a prostate tumor progressing to metastatic disease. Armed with this information, the clinician may recommend less-intensive or earlier, more-intensive treatment for the patient. \n\n“The Decipher Prostate test is already the most widely used molecular test in prostate cancer. We believe its unique status in the updated NCCN guidelines will help make it more accessible to even more patients,” said Marc Stapley, Veracyte’s chief executive officer. “This milestone also further reinforces the power of our Veracyte Diagnostics Platform. This novel, data-driven approach enables us to continuously develop high-performing, well-validated tests like Decipher Prostate that are transforming care for patients facing cancer.” \n\n**About Decipher Prostate**\n\nThe Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier is a 22-gene test, developed using RNA whole-transcriptome analysis and machine learning, that helps inform treatment decisions for patients with prostate cancer. The test is performed on biopsy or surgically resected samples and provides an accurate risk of developing metastasis with standard treatment. Armed with this information, physicians can better personalize their patients’ care and may recommend less-intensive options for those at lower risk or earlier, more-intensive treatment for those at higher risk of metastasis. The Decipher Prostate test has been validated in many dozens of published studies involving more than 100,000 patients and is the only gene expression test to be included in the most recent NCCN® Guidelines* for prostate cancer. More information about the Decipher Prostate test can be found [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecipherbio.com%2Fdecipher-prostate%2Fphysicians%2Fdecipher-prostate-overview%2F&esheet=54162855&newsitemid=20241205424200&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=2&md5=fef4541d07c12d1ffc238d877e315684). \n\n**About Veracyte**\n\nVeracyte (Nasdaq: VCYT) is a global diagnostics company whose vision is to transform cancer care for patients all over the world.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “appears,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “expect,” “believe,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “enable,” “positioned,” “offers,” “designed” and similar references to future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions, and include, but are not limited to: our ability to launch, commercialize and receive reimbursement for our products; our ability to execute on our business strategies relating to the C2i Genomics acquisition, integration of the business and the realization of expected benefits and synergies; our ability to demonstrate the validity and utility of our genomic tests and biopharma and other offerings; our ability to continue executing on our business plan; our ability to continue to scale our global operations and enhance our internal control environment; the impact of the war in Ukraine and other regional conflicts on European economies and our facilities in France; the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, increasing interest rates, inflation, the U.S. election and turmoil in the global banking and finance system; the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the performance and utility of our tests in the clinical environment. Additional factors that may impact these forward-looking statements can be found under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2024, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to be filed on November 7, 2024, as well as in other documents that we may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of these documents, when available, may be found in the Investors section of our website at [investor.veracyte.com](http://investor.veracyte.com).

These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. \n\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to internally evaluate and analyze financial results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. However, the non-GAAP financial measures we present may be different from those used by other companies. \n\nWe exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses relating to our acquisitions of Decipher Biosciences, HalioDx and C2i Genomics, impairment charges associated with the nCounter license and other biopharmaceutical services related to HalioDx intangible assets, all stock-based compensation and certain costs related to restructuring from our non-GAAP financial measures. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we changed our non-GAAP policy to exclude all stock-based compensation to align with our peers and we have also excluded all stock-based compensation from our prior period non-GAAP financial measures. Management has excluded the effects of these items in non-GAAP financial measures to help investors gain a better understanding of the core operating results and future prospects of the company, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. The company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non‐GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. \n\nVERACYTE, INC.
