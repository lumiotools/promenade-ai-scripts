The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the delivery of $600,000 of research material previously paid for in stock prior to our initial public offering in July of 2023.\n  * Net loss attributable to common shareholders in the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $2.27 million, or ($0.93) per share, compared to a net income of approximately $4.09 million, or $9.13 per share in the third quarter of 2023, representing a $6.36 million decline _._ This decline is nearly entirely attributable to a change in the fair value of liabilities of $6.20 million in Q3 2023 to ($0.06) million in Q3 2024.\n  * A $4 million private placement priced at-the-market comprising common stock and associated warrants at $1.38 per share was concluded in September with net proceeds to support working capital, commercialization of ARAKODA (**tafenoquine**), and ongoing R&D efforts.\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals granted the University of Kentucky right of reference to the Company’s new drug application (NDA) for ARAKODA® (**tafenoquine**).

Usage data generated by such a program will further inform the Company on questions related to ARAKODA customer demographics, pricing, prescription trends, and how and where to focus promotional efforts to increase sales.\n\nARAKODA is the only FDA-approved prophylactic therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) that provides protection against all stages of malaria. Further, ARAKODA is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for travelers to malaria-endemic regions, due in part to its convenient weekly dosing regimen and established safety profile.\n\n**About ARAKODA ® (tafenoquine)**\n\n**Tafenoquine** was discovered by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. **Tafenoquine** was approved for malaria prophylaxis in 2018 in the United States as ARAKODA® and in Australia as KODATEF®. Both were commercially launched in 2019 and are currently distributed through pharmaceutical wholesaler networks in each respective country. They are available at retail pharmacies as a prescription-only malaria prevention drug. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the long terminal half-life of **tafenoquine** , which is approximately 16 days, may offer potential advantages in less- frequent dosing for prophylaxis for malaria. ARAKODA® is not suitable for everyone, and patients and prescribers should review the Important Safety Information below. Individuals at risk of contracting malaria are prescribed ARAKODA® 2 x 100 mg tablets once per day for three days (the loading phase) prior to travel to an area of the world where malaria is endemic, 2 x 100 mg tablets weekly for up to six months during travel, then 2 x 100 mg in the week following travel.\n\n**ARAKODA ® (tafenoquine) Important Safety Information **\n\nARAKODA® is an antimalarial indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria in patients aged 18 years of age and older.\n\n**Contraindications**\n\nARAKODA® should not be administered to:\n\n  * Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (“G6PD”) deficiency or unknown G6PD status;\n  * Breastfeeding by a lactating woman when the infant is found to be G6PD deficient or if\n  * G6PD status is unknown;\n  * Patients with a history of psychotic disorders or current psychotic symptoms; or\n  * Known hypersensitivity reactions to **tafenoquine** , other 8-aminoquinolines, or any component of ARAKODA®.\n\n\n\n**Warnings and Precautions**\n\n**Hemolytic Anemia:** G6PD testing must be performed before prescribing ARAKODA® due to the risk of hemolytic anemia. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hemolysis.\n\n**G6PD Deficiency in Pregnancy or Lactation:** ARAKODA® may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman with a G6PD-deficient fetus. ARAKODA® is not recommended during pregnancy. A G6PD-deficient infant may be at risk for hemolytic anemia from exposure to ARAKODA® through breast milk. Check infant’s G6PD status before breastfeeding begins.\n\n**Methemoglobinemia:** Asymptomatic elevations in blood methemoglobin have been observed. Initiate appropriate therapy if signs or symptoms of methemoglobinemia occur.\n\n**Psychiatric Effects:** Serious psychotic adverse reactions have been observed in patients with a history of psychosis or schizophrenia, at doses different from the approved dose. If psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, or grossly disorganized thinking or behavior) occur, consider discontinuation of ARAKODA® therapy and evaluation by a mental health professional as soon as possible.\n\n**Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with administration of ARAKODA®. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, institute appropriate therapy.\n\n**Delayed Adverse Reactions:** Due to the long half-life of ARAKODA® (approximately 16 days), psychiatric effects, hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia, and hypersensitivity reactions may be delayed in onset and/or duration.\n\n**Adverse Reactions:** The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 1 percent) were: headache, dizziness, back pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased alanine aminotransferase, motion sickness, insomnia, depression, abnormal dreams, and anxiety.\n\n**Drug Interactions**\n\nAvoid co-administration with drugs that are substrates of organic cation transporter-2 or multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters.\n\n**Use in Specific Populations**\n\nLactation: Advise women not to breastfeed a G6PD-deficient infant or infant with unknown G6PD status during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of ARAKODA®.\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1- 888-834-0225 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-YP2VpARgBGCF-7ivOlMdzc1Pb2VRYXThutnV4RpbHTRAwd2srEAtSF0oCM7p3hbP_kTQUcUPSwlbvSdHxOrxzNG5-jkQIAhtePZjyNKZN_SSnuJ65Z0SZbNEftvsTZYHT7SAqvLMLgGAcIbrmuApfAiiyWVPV4GnjCfcEYqAd4UayOji4zcmUS66QEjBMjXsR1zFcysE2IDwR-Y9yTigpg8d26g-i_oEn0GCD2ArcgrWH1KZ-Qwi9Z7F6C7zwU08-o0lsDNw8t8FIWxNogEP8enJQXWYsH2gEsdQ9qzABaxV612vc803a4_Q1JoN-7wUlSCX21pHOB5EMvuJg6Nxs7w7zDpj886JcivxXDdKn0Q8mjaEvdiFYkKvFSPcWv17pxUTigAE9kvHEzSH-oj_N0prUV7h6nO_34iNldfjX0IfXjieRWwxB6yGZecpzv_).

Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue on a going-concern basis; we might not be eligible for Australian government research and development tax rebates; if we are not able to successfully develop, obtain FDA approval for, and provide for the commercialization of non-malaria prevention indications for **tafenoquine** (ARAKODA® or other regimen) or Celgosivir in a timely manner, we may not be able to expand our business operations; we may not be able to successfully conduct planned clinical trials; and we have no manufacturing capacity which puts us at risk of lengthy and costly delays of bringing our products to market. More detailed information about the Company and the risk factors that may affect the realization of forward-looking statements is set forth in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, and our subsequent SEC filings.

Announces Closing of $4 Million Private Placement Priced At-the-Market Under Nasdaq Rules\n\nSeptember 6, 2024 at 8:59 AM EDT\n\n[PDF Version](/node/7261/pdf)\n\nWASHINGTON, Sept. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The series A warrants and short-term series B warrants have an exercise price of $1.38 per share and will be exercisable beginning on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants (the “Stockholder Approval”). The series A warrants will expire five years from the Stockholder Approval and the short-term series B warrants will expire eighteen months from the Stockholder Approval.\n\nH.C.

Accordingly, the securities described above, including the shares of common stock underlying the warrants, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws.\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities in this offering, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\n\n**About 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\n60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals, Inc., founded in 2010, specializes in developing and marketing new medicines for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases that affect the lives of millions of people. 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals, Inc. achieved FDA approval of its lead product, ARAKODA® (tafenoquine), for malaria prevention, in 2018. 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals, Inc. also collaborates with prominent research organizations in the U.S., Australia, and Singapore.
