In addition to the above, at the 69th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on\nDecember 23, 2021, it was approved that the amount of the Restricted Share Remuneration Plan (hereinafter the\n“Remuneration Plan”) for directors (excluding outside directors) would be no more than ¥50 million per annum\nand that the maximum number of shares would be no more than 0.1 million per annum.\nWe would like to increase the upper limit of the Remuneration Plan for the directors (not outside directors) as\ndescribed in [Contents and Reasons of the Revisions]. In addition to the above, we also propose to include outside\ndirectors in the scope of the Remuneration Plan as part of the revisions to the Remuneration Plan at this General\nMeeting of the Shareholders.\nAt present, there are five directors who are subject to the Remuneration Plan. If the Proposal No. 2 and this\nProposal are approved as in the draft proposals, there will be eight directors who qualify for the Remuneration\nPlan (of whom three are outside directors).\n<Contents and Reasons of the Revisions>\nIn view of the increase of the corporate value in the course of the medium-term management plan and our share\nprice since the introduction of the Remuneration Plan, we intend to change the amount of the Remuneration Plan\nto a maximum of ¥200 million per annum (of which outside directors are limited to ¥20 million) and to a maximum\nof 0.1 million shares per year (of which outside directors are limited to 10,000 shares per year).\nPlease note that the upper limit of the number of shares for the Remuneration Plan remains up to 0.1 million\nshares per year and there is no change in this respect.\nWith the aim of further strengthening governance by promoting the further sharing of value between\nshareholders and our outside directors, and raising awareness of the need to increase corporate value sustainably,\nwe intend to extend the Remuneration Plan to outside directors.\n<Other>\nApart from the above revisions, there are no changes to the contents of this Remuneration Plan.\n12\n(Attached documents)\nBusiness Report\n(From October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024)\nCurrent Overview of the Company and affiliated companies (the “Group”)\n1. Overview of consolidated operating results for the year ended September 30, 2024\n(1) Overview of consolidated operating results\nTOYO Corporation (hereinafter “the Company”) has been pursuing growth strategies to achieve its financial\nresults forecasts (net sales of ¥34.5 billion and operating profit of ¥3.35 billion) in the fiscal year ended September\n30, 2024, the final year of the medium-term management plan “TY2024,” as well as an ROE of 8.0% or higher,\none of the management targets set out in the plan.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Physics / Energies segment remained solid, with evaluation\nequipment for next-gen batteries and EVs benefiting from active R&D investments in the carbon neutrality field.\nFurthermore, the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors segment saw a sharp year-on-year rise in sales as\nthe Company booked large-scale evaluation equipment sales for AD (autonomous driving)/ADAS (advanced\ndriving assistance system) developments in the US and Japan. As a result, consolidated sales totaled ¥35,042\nmillion (up 24.4% YoY), a record high. This broke down as domestic sales of ¥31,660 million (up 22.6%) and\noverseas sales (mainly to the US and China) of ¥3,382 million (up 43.5%).\nIn terms of profit, the Company saw a substantial year-on-year increase thanks to a boost from top line growth,\na change in the business mix and higher gross margin from large high-margin projects. Operating profit came to\n¥3,366 million (up 128.6% YoY), ordinary profit was ¥3,375 million (up 87.4%) and profit attributable to owners\nof parent was ¥2,522 million (up 64.4%).\nROE for the full year was 9.0%, a sharp improvement on the 5.3% in the previous fiscal year.\nNew orders taken totaled ¥33,628 million (up 9.3% YoY) following significant growth in the Mechatronics /\nNoise & Vibration / Sensors segment as well as order expansion in the ICT / Information Security segment and\nthe Ocean / Defense & Security segment. However, the order backlog was ¥17,032 million (down 6.2%) due to\nprogress in booking sales in the Physics / Energies segment.\n(ICT / Information Security)\nIn the ICT / Information Security business, network performance testing for major communications carriers in the\nICT field and new business in mobile mapping systems saw growth. Furthermore, sales were brisk with service\nproviders in the cyber security field. As a result, sales increased by 12.5% year-on-year to ¥7,481 million and\nsegment profit was ¥388 million (up 52.6%).\n(Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors)\nIn the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors segment, sales and profit rose sharply thanks to the booking of\nsales for large-scale AD/ADAS development projects in the VILS field (Vehicle-in-the-loop simulation, a testing\nand evaluation methodology which utilizes both real vehicles and virtual simulations) in Japan and overseas as\nwell as steady performance in noise and vibration equipment. Profit margins also improved following price\nrevisions, resulting in sharp increases in sales and profit. Sales rose by 63.1% YoY to ¥7,664 million and segment\nprofit was ¥1,595 million (up 328.6%).\n(Physics / Energies)\nIn the Physics / Energies segment, both net sales and segment profit increased significantly as both basic\nelectrochemical measurement systems and battery charging measurement system projects were very brisk thanks\nto tailwinds from the Green Innovation Fund, which supports government-backed R&D projects aimed at\ndecarbonization. A further boost was provided from the introduction of a new measurement solution, which\ndelivers an evaluation bench for electric propulsion systems for air mobility. As a result, sales rose 43.7% YoY to\n¥9,909 million and segment profit was ¥2,106 million (up 39.1%).\n(EMC & Antenna Systems)\nIn the EMC & Antenna Systems segment, despite the boost to sales from the acquisition and consolidation of\nTOYO EMC Engineering, sales and profits in the segment declined compared to the same period of the previous\nyear due to delays in securing large domestic EMC system projects and delays in sales of in-house developed\nproducts. As a result, sales declined by 13.8% YoY to ¥4,681 million and the segment profit was ¥237 million\n(down 13.4%).\n13\n(Ocean / Defense & Security)\nIn the Ocean Defense & Security segment, sales increased year-on-year thanks to the booking of sales for a\nlarge project and steady progress in inspections in other projects also. Furthermore, segment margins improved\ndue to price revisions made in response to the weaker yen. As a result, sales increased 29.7% YoY to ¥2,261\nmillion and the segment profit was ¥461 million (up 69.2%).\n(Software Quality & Productivity)\nIn the Software Quality & Productivity segment, sales were solid to game companies such as version control\ntools for game development, driving segment sales. However, the gross margin declined due to an impact from\nyen depreciation, and the selling, general and administrative costs rose in line with an increase in personnel.\nAs a result, net sales increased by 8.4% YoY to ¥2,128 million and the segment profit was ¥406 million (down\n3.9%).\n(Life Science)\nIn the Life Science segment, both sales and segment profit increased thanks to steady sales of orthopedic\ndigital planning tools at consolidated subsidiary Lexi Co., Ltd. As a result, net sales increased by 16.5% YoY\nto ¥916 million and segment profit was ¥82 million (up 162.7%).\n14\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n(As of September 30, 2024)\n(Thousands of yen)\nAccount Title Amount Account Title Amount\nAssets Liabilities\nCurrent assets 18,423,413 Current liabilities 9,883,419\nNotes and accounts payable -\nCash and deposits 3,091,691 1,683,336\ntrade\nNotes and accounts receivable -\n6,228,715 Income taxes payable 591,671\ntrade, and contract assets\nElectronically recorded monetary\n341,262 Contract liabilities 3,020,506\nclaims – operating\nSecurities 1,941,892 Short-term loan payable 2,000,000\nMerchandise and finished goods 3,997,606 Provision for bonuses 1,091,071\nPrepaid Expenses 1,966,625 Provision for directors’ bonuses 110,000\nOther 857,819 Other 1,386,834\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (2,200) Non-current liabilities 1,123,131\nNon-current assets 20,710,745 Net defined benefit liability 810,454\nProperty, plant and equipment 13,090,595 Other 312,677\nBuildings and structures 889,874 Total liabilities 11,006,550\nVehicles 2,733 Net assets\nTools, furniture and fixtures 954,420 Shareholders’ equity 28,182,273\nLand 4,714,388 Capital stock 4,158,000\nConstruction in progress 6,529,178 Capital surplus 4,611,997\nIntangible assets 2,548,490 Retained earnings 25,242,691\nGoodwill 1,561,894 Treasury stock (5,830,415)\nAccumulated other\nSoftware 858,458 (180,099)\ncomprehensive income\nValuation difference on\nSoftware in progress 22,777 17,401\navailable-for-sale securities\nDeferred gains or losses on\nOther 105,360 (94,863)\nhedges\nForeign currency translation\nInvestments and other assets 5,071,660 (147,017)\nadjustments\nRemeasurements of defined\nInvestment securities 2,414,795 44,379\nbenefit plans\nNet defined benefit asset 720,998 Subscription rights to shares 77,998\nEquity of non-controlling\nDeferred tax assets 812,429 47,436\nshareholder\nLong-term time deposits 700,141\nOther 456,444\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (33,149) Total net assets 28,127,608\nTotal assets 39,134,159 Total liabilities and net assets 39,134,159\nNote: Amounts are rounded down to the nearest thousand yen.\n15\nConsolidated Statement of Income\n(From October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024)\n(Thousands of yen)\nAccount Title Amount\nNet sales 35,042,582\nCost of sales 19,860,311\nGross profit 15,182,271\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 11,816,190\nOperating income 3,366,080\nNon-operating income\nInterest income 51,731\nDividend income 18,236\nOutsourcing fee 30,052\nInsurance cancellation refund 25,231\nOther 31,996 157,248\nNon-operating expenses\nInterest expenses 6,340\nCommission for purchase of treasury stock 2,066\nLoss on investments in investment partnerships 15,964\nShare of loss of entities accounted for using equity method 15,530\nCurrency exchange loss 106,943\nOther 1,013 147,860\nOrdinary income 3,375,469\nExtraordinary income\nGain on step acquisitions 3,281\nGain on sales of non-current assets 3,509,184\nGain on sales of investment securities 10,054 3,522,521\nExtraordinary losses\nImpairment loss 304,210\nLoss on disposal of non-current assets 31,650\nLoss on reduction of non-current assets 3,241,737 3,577,599\nIncome before income taxes 3,320,391\nIncome taxes -

Overview of operating results, etc.\n(1) Overview of operating results for the year ended September 30, 2024\nIn the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, TOYO Corporation (“the Company”) is pursuing growth strategies to\nachieve its financial results forecasts (net sales of ¥34.5 billion and operating profit of ¥3.35 billion) in the final year\nof the medium-term management plan “TY2024” as well as an ROE of 8.0% or higher, one of the management\ntargets set out in the plan.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Physics / Energies segment remained solid, with evaluation\nequipment for next-gen batteries and EVs benefiting from active R&D investment in the carbon neutrality field.\nFurthermore, the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors segment saw a sharp year-on-year rise in sales as the\nCompany booked large-scale evaluation equipment sales for AD (autonomous driving)/ADAS (advanced driving\nassistance system) development in the US and Japan. As a result, consolidated net sales totaled ¥35,042 million (up\n24.4% YoY), a record high. This broke down as domestic sales of ¥31,660 million (up 22.6%) and overseas sales\n(mainly to the US and China) of ¥3,382 million (up 43.5%).\nIn terms of profit, the Company saw a substantial year-on-year increase thanks to a boost from top line growth,\na change in the business mix and higher gross margin from large high-margin projects. Operating profit came to\n¥3,366 million (up 128.6% YoY), ordinary profit was ¥3,375 million (up 87.4%) and profit attributable to owners\nof parent was ¥2,522 million (up 64.4%).\nROE for the full year was 9.0%, a sharp improvement on the 5.3% in the previous fiscal year.\nNew orders taken totaled ¥33,628 million (up 9.3% YoY) following significant growth in the Mechatronics /\nNoise & Vibration / Sensors segment as well as order expansion in the ICT / Information Security segment and the\nOcean / Defense & Security segment. However, the order backlog was ¥17,032 million (down 6.2%) due to progress\nin booking sales in the Physics / Energies segment.\nThe results by segment were as follows:\n(ICT / Information Security)\nIn the ICT / Information Security business, network performance testing for major communications carriers in the\nICT field and new business in mobile mapping systems saw growth. Furthermore, sales were brisk from service\nproviders in the cyber security field. As a result, net sales increased by 12.5% year-on-year to ¥7,481 million and\nsegment profit was ¥388 million (up 52.6%).\n(Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors)\nIn the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors segment, sales and profit rose sharply thanks to the booking of\nsales for large-scale AD/ADAS development projects in the VILS field (Vehicle-in-the-loop simulation, a testing\nand evaluation methodology which utilizes both real vehicles and virtual simulations) in Japan and overseas as well\nas steady performance in noise and vibration equipment. Profit margins also improved following price revisions,\nresulting in sharp increases in sales and profit. As a result, net sales rose by 63.1% YoY to ¥7,664 million and\nsegment profit was ¥1,595 million (up 328.6%).\n(Physics / Energies)\nIn the Physics / Energies segment, both net sales and segment profit increased significantly as both basic\nelectrochemical measurement systems and battery charging measurement system projects were very brisk thanks to\ntailwinds from the Green Innovation Fund, which supports government-backed R&D projects aimed at\ndecarbonization. A further boost was provided from the introduction of a new measurement solution, which delivers\nan evaluation bench for electric propulsion systems for air mobility. As a result, net sales rose 43.7% YoY to ¥9,909\nmillion and segment profit was ¥2,106 million (up 39.1%).\n(EMC & Antenna Systems)\nIn the EMC & Antenna Systems segment, despite the boost to sales from the acquisition and consolidation of Toyo\nEMC Engineering, sales and profits in the segment declined compared to the same period of the previous year due\nto delays in securing large domestic EMC system projects and delays in sales of in-house developed products. As a\nresult, net sales declined by 13.8% to ¥4,681 million and profit was ¥237 million (down 13.4%).\n(Ocean / Defense & Security)\nIn the Ocean Defense & Security segment, sales increased year-on-year thanks to the booking of sales for a large\nproject and steady progress in inspections in other projects also. Furthermore, segment margins improved due to\nprice revisions made in response to the weaker yen. As a result, net sales increased 29.7% YoY to ¥2,261 million\nand segment profit was ¥461 million (up 69.2%).\n2\n(Software Quality & Productivity)\nIn the Software Quality & Productivity segment, sales were solid to game companies such as version control\ntools for game development, driving segment sales. However, the gross margin declined due to an impact from\nyen depreciation and selling, general and administrative costs rose in line with an increase in personnel. As a\nresult, net sales increased 8.4% YoY to ¥2,128 million and segment profit was ¥406 million (down 3.9%).\n(Life Science)\nIn the Life Science segment, both sales and segment profit increased thanks to steady sales of orthopedic digital\nplanning tools sales at consolidated subsidiary Lexi Co, Ltd. As a result, net sales increased by 16.5% YoY to\n¥916 million and segment profit was ¥82 million (up 162.7%).\n(2) Overview of financial position for the year ended September 30, 2024\nAssets, Liabilities and Net Assets\nTotal assets as of September 30, 2024 were ¥39,134 million, a decrease of ¥820 million compared to the end of the\nprevious fiscal year. The main positive factors were an increase of ¥1,693 million in notes and accounts receivable,\nan increase of ¥1,294 million in goodwill, and an increase of ¥827 million in construction in progress. Meanwhile,\nthe main negative factors were a decrease of ¥2,094 million in land assets, a decline of ¥1,789 million in buildings\nand structures (net), and a decrease of ¥1,116 million in investment securities.\nTotal liabilities decreased by ¥634 million compared to the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥11,006 million.\nThe main positive factors were an increase of ¥2,000 million in short-term borrowings, an increase of ¥409 million\nin other current liabilities, and an increase of ¥318 million for provisions for bonuses. Meanwhile, the main negative\nfactor was a decrease of ¥4,060 million in advances received.\nNet assets decreased by ¥186 million compared to the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥28,127 million. The\nmain positive factors were an increase of ¥1,247 million in retained earnings, an increase of ¥71 million in valuation\ndifference on available-for-sale securities, and an increase of ¥47 million in non-controlling interests. Meanwhile,\nthe main negative factor was an increase of ¥1,333 million in treasury stock and a decrease of ¥224 million in\ndeferred gains or losses on hedges.\n(3) Cash flow position in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents (hereinafter referred to as “cash”) at the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024\nincreased by ¥432 million compared to the end of the previous fiscal year, totaling ¥3,091 million. The status of each\ntype of cash flow is as follows:\n(Cash flow from operating activities)\nThe main factors contributing to an increase in cash were a pre-tax net profit of ¥3,320 million and a decrease in\ninventories of ¥713 million. However, the main factors for a decrease were an increase in trade receivables and\ncontract assets of ¥1,321 million and payment of corporate taxes of ¥709 million. As a result, cash flow from\noperating activities increased by ¥4,110 million\n(Cash flow from investing activities)\nThe main factors contributing to an increase in cash were income of ¥1,168 million from the sale of investment\nsecurities and income of ¥706 million from the sale of other securities. However, the main factors for a decrease in\nfunds were expenditure of ¥1,722 million for the acquisition of subsidiary shares as a result of changes in the scope\nof consolidation and expenditure of ¥1,574 million for the acquisition of property, plants and equipment. As a result,\ncash flow from investing activities decreased by ¥2,892 million\n(Cash flow from financing activities)\nThe main factor contributing to an increase in cash was a net increase in short-term borrowings of ¥1,959 million.\nHowever, the main factors for a decrease were expenditure of ¥1,420 million for the acquisition of treasury stock\nand dividend payments of ¥1,275 million. As a result, cash flow from financing activities decreased by ¥736 million.\n3\n(Reference) Cash flow indicators over time\nFY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024\nEquity Ratio (%) 87.1 76.1 70.4 70.6 71.6\nMarket-Based Equity Ratio (%) 70.7 73.5 68.0 73.0 88.8\nCash Flow to Interest-Bearing\nYears 1.8 ― ― ― 48.7\nDebt Ratio\nInterest Coverage Ratio (x) 752.0 3,407.4 ― ― 677.3\nEquity Ratio: Equity / Total Assets\nMarket-Based Equity Ratio: Market Capitalization / Total Assets\nCash Flow to Interest-Bearing Debt Ratio: Interest-Bearing Debt / Operating Cash Flow\nInterest Coverage Ratio: Operating Cash Flow / Interest Payments\n*Note: Each indicator is calculated based on consolidated financial figures.\n*Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the year-end stock price by the number of shares issued at year-\nend (after deducting treasury stock).\n*Operating cash flow uses the cash flow from operating activities from the consolidated cash flow statement.\nInterest-bearing debt includes all debts listed on the consolidated balance sheet that incur interest payments.\n*The “Interest Coverage Ratio” for the fiscal year ending September 2023 is not disclosed due to a negative\noperating cash flow.\n(4) Future outlook\nOur group has set a vision called \"BreakThrough600\" for FY2030, which targets consolidated net sales of ¥60 billion,\noperating profit of ¥7.5 billion, and ROE of 15.0%. Currently, we are progressing with a medium-term management\nplan, \"TY2027,\" that ends in FY2027, which represents the midway point toward FY2030. This plan sets out our\ntargets for consolidated net sales of ¥45 billion, operating profit of ¥4.5 billion, and ROE of 11.0% by the final year.\nWe will execute a growth strategy around three pillars - business strategy, financial and capital strategy, and\nsustainability management - to continuously enhance corporate value.\n1. Business Strategy\nWe will focus on growing our business mainly in the advanced mobility, decarbonization/energies, and defense\nsectors. To further add value and differentiate our products and services, we will promote recurring business\nmodels that offer stable earnings and expand proprietary solutions using our in-house products. We will also\nstrengthen overseas expansion, including establishing new offices. Additionally, we will proactively pursue\nM&A opportunities to accelerate our group’s growth strategy.\n2. Financial and Capital Strategy\nUsing funds from operating cash flow, asset sales, and bank borrowings, we plan to allocate over 50% toward\ngrowth investments, including M&A. We will actively invest in human capital, facilities, and DX/AI to\nstrengthen our management base, drive business growth, and enhance capital returns.\nFor shareholder returns, we aim for stable and strategic distributions by maintaining a dividend policy with\na DOE (Dividend on Equity) of at least 5%, striving for continuous dividend increases. With regards to the\nacquisition of treasury stock, we will consider this as needed, taking into account the balance with growth\ninvestments.\n3. Sustainability Management\nBased on the understanding across the company that our business activities align with promoting sustainability,\nwe have identified five priority issues that should be addressed from both a social impact and a management\nbase perspective. In the medium-term management plan \"TY2027,\" we will accelerate our initiatives by setting\nspecific focus areas within the Sustainability Medium-Term Plan \"STY2027.\" The whole company will work\ntogether to address key priorities of \"contributing to technological innovation,\" \"promoting environmental\n4\nconservation,\" and \"establishing a sustainable management foundation.\" Specific goals include expanding sales\nof solutions that support advanced mobility development and the transition to a decarbonized society, increasing\nthe ratio of female managers, and achieving certification as a company promoting health management. We aim\nto advance SX (Sustainability Transformation) continuously, working toward sustainable corporate value\nenhancement and a sustainable society.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, revenue booking was concentrated due to smooth progress in\ninspections for many projects as well as projects carried over from the previous year. In the fiscal year ending\nSeptember 30, 2025, as well as laying the groundwork for the first year of the medium-term management plan, we\nwill actively invest in new businesses to achieve our growth strategies and also focus on securing and training human\nresources.\nBased on these initiatives, our earnings forecasts for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025 are net sales of\n¥33 billion, operating profit of ¥2.4 billion, ordinary profit of ¥2.4 billion, and net profit attributable to owners of\nparent of ¥1.75 billion.\n(5) Policy concerning decisions on profit distribution and dividend forecast\nDuring the period covered by \"TY2024\" plan (FY9/22 to FY9/24), the Company enhanced shareholder returns.\nUnder this plan, we opted for a DOE of 4% or a consolidated dividend payout ratio of 60%, targeting a consistent\nand proactive approach to dividends. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, based on this policy, we planned\nan annual dividend of ¥68 per share. The interim dividend of ¥25 per share was approved by the Board of Directors\non May 15, 2024, and paid on June 11, 2024.\nIn the \"TY2027\" medium-term management plan (FY9/25 to FY9/27), our dividend policy targets a DOE of at\nleast 5% aiming for stable and continuous dividend increases. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, we\nforecast a dividend of ¥69 per share, including an interim dividend of ¥30.\nIn addition to dividends, we have been actively engaged in share buybacks. Most recently, from August 8 to\nOctober 3, 2024, we repurchased 936,600 shares for approximately ¥1.5 billion. We will continue to balance share\nbuybacks with growth investments and consider repurchases as appropriate to support shareholder value.\n2. Basic policy on selection of accounting standards\nOur group currently prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with Japanese GAAP to ensure\ncomparability across periods and with other companies.\nHowever, regarding the potential adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), we plan to\nrespond appropriately, taking into account relevant conditions both domestically and internationally.\n5\n3.

Qualitative Information on Quarterly Financial Results\n(1) Explanation of Operating Results\nThe fiscal year ending September 30, 2024 marks the final year of the medium-term management plan\n“TY2024” and TOYO Corporation (the “Company”) is pursuing growth strategies to achieve its initial\nfinancial results forecast (net sales of ¥32.0 billion and operating profit of ¥3.0 billion) as well as an ROE of\n8.0% or higher, one of the management targets set in the medium-term management plan.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, net sales in the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration\nbusiness grew significantly as a result of reporting sales from a major project for AD (Autonomous Driving)\nand ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems) development in the U.S. that had been delayed. The Physics\n/ Energies business also continued its steady growth on the back of the brisk carbon neutrality market. As a\nresult, consolidated net sales increased by 26.0% year on year to ¥6,944 million. Among net sales, domestic net\nsales increased by 8.5% year on year to ¥5,062 million, while overseas sales, mainly to China and the U.S.,\nincreased by 122.9% year on year to ¥1,882 million.\nIn terms of profits, in addition to this increase in sales, the Company’s successful attempts to minimize the\neffects of exchange rate fluctuations, as well as keeping selling, general and administrative expenses within the\nplanned parameters contributed to a substantial year-on-year increase. Accordingly, operating profit was ¥732\nmillion (compared to an operating loss of ¥169 million in the same period of the previous fiscal year), ordinary\nprofit was ¥670 million (compared to an ordinary loss of ¥266 million in the same period of the previous fiscal\nyear), and profit attributable to owners of parent was ¥657 million (compared to a loss attributable to owners of\nparent of ¥187 million in the same period of the previous fiscal year). It should be noted that no changes have\nbeen made to the consolidated financial results forecast announced at the beginning of the year.\nOrders at ¥7,570 million (down 2.3% year on year) were on par with the same period of the previous\nfiscal year when an order for a major project was received. Meanwhile, the order backlog grew even further to\n¥19,095 million (up 7.4% year on year).\nThe results by business segment were as follows:\n(ICT / Information Security)\nIn the ICT / Information Security business, sluggish demand for testing and installation for commercial 5G\nservices continued in the information and communication technologies field. On the other hand, sales of\nprojects for service providers were brisk in the cloud services field. As a result, net sales increased by 4.4 %\nyear on year to ¥1,415 million and segment profit was ¥13 million (compared to a segment loss of ¥1 million\nin the same period of the previous fiscal year).\n(Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration)\nIn the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration business, both net sales and segment profit increased significantly due\nto the delivery of a major project for AD and ADAS development in the U.S., as well as to the price revisions\nand the recording of sales from high-profit-margin projects. As a result, net sales increased by 138.9% year on\nyear to ¥2,479 million and segment profit increased by 1,923.7% year on year to ¥886 million.\n(Physics / Energies)\nIn the Physics / Energies business, both net sales and segment profit increased thanks to the continuing brisk\nsales of measurement systems for the development of next-generation batteries and basic electrochemical\nmeasurement systems including in-house developed products. As a result, net sales increased by 9.3% year on\nyear to ¥1,027 million and segment profit was ¥27 million (compared to a segment loss of ¥36 million in the\nsame period of the previous fiscal year).\n(EMC / Antenna Systems)\nIn the EMC / Antenna Systems business, net sales declined compared to the same period of the previous fiscal\nyear when deliveries increased following the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Meanwhile,\nsegment profit increased due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, marking the\ncompletion of the investments in in-house development. As a result, net sales decreased by 12.5% year on year\nto ¥1,110 million and segment profit increased by 59.1% year on year to ¥100 million.\n2\n(Ocean / Defense & Security)\nIn the Ocean / Defense & Security business, net sales decreased compared to the same period of the previous\nfiscal year when sales from a major project was recorded. Additionally, selling, general and administrative\nexpenses increased in conjunction with upfront investments to expand future sales. As a result, net sales\ndecreased by 47.4% year on year to ¥205 million and segment loss was ¥20 million (compared to a segment\nprofit of ¥46 million in the same period of the previous fiscal year).\n(Software Quality and Productivity)\nIn the Software Quality & Productivity business, both net sales and segment profit increased due to continuing\nstrong performance in the game-related business. As a result, net sales increased by 14.8% year on year to ¥468\nmillion and segment profit increased by 18.0% year on year to ¥85 million.\n(Life Science)\nIn the Life Science business, both net sales and segment profit increased, thanks to the brisk sales of orthopedic\ndigital planning tools and the inclusion of LEXI Co., Ltd. in the scope of consolidation from the third quarter\nof the previous fiscal year. As a result, net sales increased by 115.0% year on year to ¥238 million and segment\nprofit was ¥24 million (compared to a segment loss of ¥11 million in the same period of the previous fiscal\nyear).\n(2) Explanation of Financial Position\nTotal assets at December 31, 2023 were ¥41,469 million, an increase of ¥1,514 million compared to the end of\nthe previous fiscal year. The main factors for the increase were an increase of ¥1,261 million in goodwill, an\nincrease of ¥1,133 million in merchandise and finished goods, and an increase of ¥892 million in construction\nin progress. Meanwhile, the main factors for the decrease were a decrease of ¥1,316 million in investment\nsecurities and a decrease of ¥801 million in notes and accounts receivable – trade, and contract assets.\nTotal liabilities increased by ¥1,747 million compared to the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥13,388\nmillion. The main factors for the increase were an increase of ¥2,000 million in short-term borrowings and an\nincrease of ¥151 million in notes and accounts payable – trade. Meanwhile, the main factor for the decrease\nwas a decrease of ¥352 million in provision for bonuses.\nNet assets decreased by ¥232 million compared to the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥28,081 million.\nThe main factor for the increase was the decrease of ¥21 million in treasury shares. Meanwhile, the main\nfactors for the decrease were a decrease of ¥167 million in deferred gains or losses on hedges and a decrease of\n¥63 million in retained earnings.\n(3) Explanation of Consolidated Financial Results Forecast and Other Forward-looking Information\nThe consolidated results forecast announced for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, announced on\nNovember 8, 2023 remains unchanged.\n3\n2.

(hereinafter “Tokin EMC”) and to make Tokin EMC its\nconsolidated subsidiary, and on December 19, 2023, signed an agreement to acquire the shares of the said\ncompany. Subsequently, the Company, based on this stock transfer agreement, acquired the shares, effective\nJanuary 1, 2024, and changed the said company’s name to TOYO EMC Engineering.\n1. Purpose of the acquisition\nHaving been in the EMC business for over 40 years, the Company has maintained a large market share by\ndeveloping in-house test systems and software utilizing its extensive knowledge. The Company provides\ncalibration services required to maintain the measurement accuracy of EMC measurement instruments and is\naccredited by A2LA (American Association of Laboratory Accreditation) as an ISO/IEC 17025 calibration\nlaboratory capable of performing highly accurate calibration. Tokin EMC also has provided EMC testing*\nservices, support for EMC measures, calibration of measurement instruments, and support services for\nacquiring certification overseas for nearly 40 years. Tokin EMC provides contract EMC testing services in a\nwide range of fields, including telecommunications equipment, in-vehicle devices, and medical equipment,\nand has three measurement centers in Japan equipped with radio anechoic chambers, including a chamber for\ntesting in-vehicle products. Tokin EMC, like the Company, is also accredited by the A2LA for its high-\nprecision calibration services.\nThe Company will further expand its EMC business, one of its core businesses, by efficiently operating\nfacilities such as radio anechoic chambers, responding to diverse EMC testing needs, promoting the\ndevelopment of advanced solutions, and creating synergies in certified calibration services by making Tokin\nEMC a subsidiary and combining the knowledge and technical expertise of both companies.\n*EMC testing: A test based on electromagnetic compatibility regulations that evaluate two characteristics:\n“electrical noise emitted by electronic equipment does not affect other equipment” and “the normal operation\nof electronic equipment is not interfered with by electrical noise from the outside”. All equipment with\nelectrical and electronic components must comply with the laws of each country based on international EMC\nstandards before being marketed. This test is becoming particularly important in the automotive industry,\nwhere the development of electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving (AD)/advanced driver assistance\nsystem (ADAS) functions is progressing.\n2.

Overview of operating results, etc.\n(1) Overview of operating results for the year ended September 30, 2024\nIn the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, TOYO Corporation (“the Company”) is pursuing growth strategies to\nachieve its financial results forecasts (net sales of ¥34.5 billion and operating profit of ¥3.35 billion) in the final year\nof the medium-term management plan “TY2024” as well as an ROE of 8.0% or higher, one of the management\ntargets set out in the plan.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Physics / Energies segment remained solid, with evaluation\nequipment for next-gen batteries and EVs benefiting from active R&D investment in the carbon neutrality field.\nFurthermore, the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors segment saw a sharp year-on-year rise in sales as the\nCompany booked large-scale evaluation equipment sales for AD (autonomous driving)/ADAS (advanced driving\nassistance system) development in the US and Japan. As a result, consolidated net sales totaled ¥35,042 million (up\n24.4% YoY), a record high. This broke down as domestic sales of ¥31,660 million (up 22.6%) and overseas sales\n(mainly to the US and China) of ¥3,382 million (up 43.5%).\nIn terms of profit, the Company saw a substantial year-on-year increase thanks to a boost from top line growth,\na change in the business mix and higher gross margin from large high-margin projects. Operating profit came to\n¥3,366 million (up 128.6% YoY), ordinary profit was ¥3,375 million (up 87.4%) and profit attributable to owners\nof parent was ¥2,522 million (up 64.4%).\nROE for the full year was 9.0%, a sharp improvement on the 5.3% in the previous fiscal year.\nNew orders taken totaled ¥33,628 million (up 9.3% YoY) following significant growth in the Mechatronics /\nNoise & Vibration / Sensors segment as well as order expansion in the ICT / Information Security segment and the\nOcean / Defense & Security segment. However, the order backlog was ¥17,032 million (down 6.2%) due to progress\nin booking sales in the Physics / Energies segment.\nThe results by segment were as follows:\n(ICT / Information Security)\nIn the ICT / Information Security business, network performance testing for major communications carriers in the\nICT field and new business in mobile mapping systems saw growth. Furthermore, sales were brisk from service\nproviders in the cyber security field. As a result, net sales increased by 12.5% year-on-year to ¥7,481 million and\nsegment profit was ¥388 million (up 52.6%).\n(Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors)\nIn the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors segment, sales and profit rose sharply thanks to the booking of\nsales for large-scale AD/ADAS development projects in the VILS field (Vehicle-in-the-loop simulation, a testing\nand evaluation methodology which utilizes both real vehicles and virtual simulations) in Japan and overseas as well\nas steady performance in noise and vibration equipment. Profit margins also improved following price revisions,\nresulting in sharp increases in sales and profit. As a result, net sales rose by 63.1% YoY to ¥7,664 million and\nsegment profit was ¥1,595 million (up 328.6%).\n(Physics / Energies)\nIn the Physics / Energies segment, both net sales and segment profit increased significantly as both basic\nelectrochemical measurement systems and battery charging measurement system projects were very brisk thanks to\ntailwinds from the Green Innovation Fund, which supports government-backed R&D projects aimed at\ndecarbonization. A further boost was provided from the introduction of a new measurement solution, which delivers\nan evaluation bench for electric propulsion systems for air mobility. As a result, net sales rose 43.7% YoY to ¥9,909\nmillion and segment profit was ¥2,106 million (up 39.1%).\n(EMC & Antenna Systems)\nIn the EMC & Antenna Systems segment, despite the boost to sales from the acquisition and consolidation of Toyo\nEMC Engineering, sales and profits in the segment declined compared to the same period of the previous year due\nto delays in securing large domestic EMC system projects and delays in sales of in-house developed products. As a\nresult, net sales declined by 13.8% to ¥4,681 million and profit was ¥237 million (down 13.4%).\n(Ocean / Defense & Security)\nIn the Ocean Defense & Security segment, sales increased year-on-year thanks to the booking of sales for a large\nproject and steady progress in inspections in other projects also. Furthermore, segment margins improved due to\nprice revisions made in response to the weaker yen. As a result, net sales increased 29.7% YoY to ¥2,261 million\nand segment profit was ¥461 million (up 69.2%).\n2\n(Software Quality & Productivity)\nIn the Software Quality & Productivity segment, sales were solid to game companies such as version control\ntools for game development, driving segment sales. However, the gross margin declined due to an impact from\nyen depreciation and selling, general and administrative costs rose in line with an increase in personnel. As a\nresult, net sales increased 8.4% YoY to ¥2,128 million and segment profit was ¥406 million (down 3.9%).\n(Life Science)\nIn the Life Science segment, both sales and segment profit increased thanks to steady sales of orthopedic digital\nplanning tools sales at consolidated subsidiary Lexi Co, Ltd. As a result, net sales increased by 16.5% YoY to\n¥916 million and segment profit was ¥82 million (up 162.7%).\n(2) Overview of financial position for the year ended September 30, 2024\nAssets, Liabilities and Net Assets\nTotal assets as of September 30, 2024 were ¥39,134 million, a decrease of ¥820 million compared to the end of the\nprevious fiscal year.

The status of each\ntype of cash flow is as follows:\n(Cash flow from operating activities)\nThe main factors contributing to an increase in cash were a pre-tax net profit of ¥3,320 million and a decrease in\ninventories of ¥713 million. However, the main factors for a decrease were an increase in trade receivables and\ncontract assets of ¥1,321 million and payment of corporate taxes of ¥709 million. As a result, cash flow from\noperating activities increased by ¥4,110 million\n(Cash flow from investing activities)\nThe main factors contributing to an increase in cash were income of ¥1,168 million from the sale of investment\nsecurities and income of ¥706 million from the sale of other securities. However, the main factors for a decrease in\nfunds were expenditure of ¥1,722 million for the acquisition of subsidiary shares as a result of changes in the scope\nof consolidation and expenditure of ¥1,574 million for the acquisition of property, plants and equipment. As a result,\ncash flow from investing activities decreased by ¥2,892 million\n(Cash flow from financing activities)\nThe main factor contributing to an increase in cash was a net increase in short-term borrowings of ¥1,959 million.\nHowever, the main factors for a decrease were expenditure of ¥1,420 million for the acquisition of treasury stock\nand dividend payments of ¥1,275 million. As a result, cash flow from financing activities decreased by ¥736 million.\n3\n(Reference) Cash flow indicators over time\nFY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024\nEquity Ratio (%) 87.1 76.1 70.4 70.6 71.6\nMarket-Based Equity Ratio (%) 70.7 73.5 68.0 73.0 88.8\nCash Flow to Interest-Bearing\nYears 1.8 ― ― ― 48.7\nDebt Ratio\nInterest Coverage Ratio (x) 752.0 3,407.4 ― ― 677.3\nEquity Ratio: Equity / Total Assets\nMarket-Based Equity Ratio: Market Capitalization / Total Assets\nCash Flow to Interest-Bearing Debt Ratio: Interest-Bearing Debt / Operating Cash Flow\nInterest Coverage Ratio: Operating Cash Flow / Interest Payments\n*Note: Each indicator is calculated based on consolidated financial figures.\n*Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the year-end stock price by the number of shares issued at year-\nend (after deducting treasury stock).\n*Operating cash flow uses the cash flow from operating activities from the consolidated cash flow statement.\nInterest-bearing debt includes all debts listed on the consolidated balance sheet that incur interest payments.\n*The “Interest Coverage Ratio” for the fiscal year ending September 2023 is not disclosed due to a negative\noperating cash flow.\n(4) Future outlook\nOur group has set a vision called \"BreakThrough600\" for FY2030, which targets consolidated net sales of ¥60 billion,\noperating profit of ¥7.5 billion, and ROE of 15.0%. Currently, we are progressing with a medium-term management\nplan, \"TY2027,\" that ends in FY2027, which represents the midway point toward FY2030. This plan sets out our\ntargets for consolidated net sales of ¥45 billion, operating profit of ¥4.5 billion, and ROE of 11.0% by the final year.\nWe will execute a growth strategy around three pillars - business strategy, financial and capital strategy, and\nsustainability management - to continuously enhance corporate value.\n1. Business Strategy\nWe will focus on growing our business mainly in the advanced mobility, decarbonization/energies, and defense\nsectors. To further add value and differentiate our products and services, we will promote recurring business\nmodels that offer stable earnings and expand proprietary solutions using our in-house products. We will also\nstrengthen overseas expansion, including establishing new offices. Additionally, we will proactively pursue\nM&A opportunities to accelerate our group’s growth strategy.\n2. Financial and Capital Strategy\nUsing funds from operating cash flow, asset sales, and bank borrowings, we plan to allocate over 50% toward\ngrowth investments, including M&A. We will actively invest in human capital, facilities, and DX/AI to\nstrengthen our management base, drive business growth, and enhance capital returns.\nFor shareholder returns, we aim for stable and strategic distributions by maintaining a dividend policy with\na DOE (Dividend on Equity) of at least 5%, striving for continuous dividend increases. With regards to the\nacquisition of treasury stock, we will consider this as needed, taking into account the balance with growth\ninvestments.\n3. Sustainability Management\nBased on the understanding across the company that our business activities align with promoting sustainability,\nwe have identified five priority issues that should be addressed from both a social impact and a management\nbase perspective. In the medium-term management plan \"TY2027,\" we will accelerate our initiatives by setting\nspecific focus areas within the Sustainability Medium-Term Plan \"STY2027.\" The whole company will work\ntogether to address key priorities of \"contributing to technological innovation,\" \"promoting environmental\n4\nconservation,\" and \"establishing a sustainable management foundation.\" Specific goals include expanding sales\nof solutions that support advanced mobility development and the transition to a decarbonized society, increasing\nthe ratio of female managers, and achieving certification as a company promoting health management. We aim\nto advance SX (Sustainability Transformation) continuously, working toward sustainable corporate value\nenhancement and a sustainable society.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, revenue booking was concentrated due to smooth progress in\ninspections for many projects as well as projects carried over from the previous year. In the fiscal year ending\nSeptember 30, 2025, as well as laying the groundwork for the first year of the medium-term management plan, we\nwill actively invest in new businesses to achieve our growth strategies and also focus on securing and training human\nresources.\nBased on these initiatives, our earnings forecasts for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025 are net sales of\n¥33 billion, operating profit of ¥2.4 billion, ordinary profit of ¥2.4 billion, and net profit attributable to owners of\nparent of ¥1.75 billion.\n(5) Policy concerning decisions on profit distribution and dividend forecast\nDuring the period covered by \"TY2024\" plan (FY9/22 to FY9/24), the Company enhanced shareholder returns.\nUnder this plan, we opted for a DOE of 4% or a consolidated dividend payout ratio of 60%, targeting a consistent\nand proactive approach to dividends. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, based on this policy, we planned\nan annual dividend of ¥68 per share. The interim dividend of ¥25 per share was approved by the Board of Directors\non May 15, 2024, and paid on June 11, 2024.\nIn the \"TY2027\" medium-term management plan (FY9/25 to FY9/27), our dividend policy targets a DOE of at\nleast 5% aiming for stable and continuous dividend increases. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, we\nforecast a dividend of ¥69 per share, including an interim dividend of ¥30.\nIn addition to dividends, we have been actively engaged in share buybacks. Most recently, from August 8 to\nOctober 3, 2024, we repurchased 936,600 shares for approximately ¥1.5 billion. We will continue to balance share\nbuybacks with growth investments and consider repurchases as appropriate to support shareholder value.\n2. Basic policy on selection of accounting standards\nOur group currently prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with Japanese GAAP to ensure\ncomparability across periods and with other companies.\nHowever, regarding the potential adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), we plan to\nrespond appropriately, taking into account relevant conditions both domestically and internationally.\n5\n3.

Overview of reportable segments\n(1) Method of determining reportable segments\nThe reportable segments of the Group are the constituent units of the Group for which separate financial information\nis available, and which the Board of Directors periodically reviews in order to determine the allocation of\nmanagement resources and evaluate business performance. The Group's main business is the provision of products\nand solutions related to various measurements both in domestic and overseas markets, the development of original\nproducts and solutions, and related support, maintenance, repair, and calibration, and it develops strategies for each\nbusiness and develops business activities.\nAs a result, the constituent units of the Group are composed of segments by technology field, and the seven\nreportable segments based on similar technologies and areas are \"ICT / Information Security,\" \"Mechatronics /\nNoise & Vibration / Sensors,\" \"Physics / Energies,\" \"EMC & Antenna Systems,\" \"Ocean / Defense & Security,\"\n\"Software Quality & Productivity,\" and \"Life Science.\"\n(2) Products and services in each reportable segment\n(ICT / Information Security)\nIn the ICT field, we provide a wide range of advanced solutions in line with the latest technical standards, such as\ntest systems and analysis/monitoring systems that realize network performance testing, operation visualization, and\ninformation security assurance to ensure quality and safe operation in information and communications technology.\nIn the information security field, in addition to service solution-type and engineering-type services, we provide\nnew services, in real time, using the latest IT technologies (cloud, OSS, machine learning, big data analysis).\n(Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / sensors)\nWe provide equipment and solutions related to measurement and analysis used in research and development of\nperformance (such as maneuverability, comfort) of transportation equipment such as automobiles and railways, as\nwell as \"noise & vibration\" and \"safety/durability\" including industrial machinery, as well as management of\nexperimental data. In addition, we are focusing on providing solutions for R&D in the latest fields such as\nautonomous driving and electrification in automobiles.\n(Physics / Energies)\nWe provide high-precision measurement and evaluation systems in a wide range of fields, from basic research on\nmaterials and devices such as power semiconductors and organic electronics to product development such as\nbatteries and inverters, in response to the dramatic changes in energy infrastructure caused by increased penetration\nof renewable energy and EVs.\n15\n(EMC / Antenna Systems)\nWe provide antenna measurement solutions such as evaluation solutions that support compliance with\nelectromagnetic environments in EMC (electromagnetic compatibility) for all electronic devices, such as\nautomobiles, information and communication devices, home appliances, and medical devices, as well as OTA (Over\nThe Air) measurement systems for connected cars. We also provide total solutions from system proposals such as\nlarge parabolic antenna ground stations to sales, installation work, and maintenance.\n(Ocean / Defense & Security)\nWe provide a wide range of measurement equipment that is useful in a wide range of marine-related fields, from\noffshore, underwater, and seabed observation to underwater drones and underwater data communications, as well\nas survey and exploration, defense, the fisheries industry, and offshore wind power generation.\n(Software Quality & Productivity)\nWe provide products and services that support the whole development lifecycle, from improving quality to\nproductivity in software development.

Overview of consolidated operating results for the year ended September 30, 2024\n(1) Overview of consolidated operating results\nTOYO Corporation (hereinafter “the Company”) has been pursuing growth strategies to achieve its financial\nresults forecasts (net sales of ¥34.5 billion and operating profit of ¥3.35 billion) in the fiscal year ended September\n30, 2024, the final year of the medium-term management plan “TY2024,” as well as an ROE of 8.0% or higher,\none of the management targets set out in the plan.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Physics / Energies segment remained solid, with evaluation\nequipment for next-gen batteries and EVs benefiting from active R&D investments in the carbon neutrality field.\nFurthermore, the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors segment saw a sharp year-on-year rise in sales as\nthe Company booked large-scale evaluation equipment sales for AD (autonomous driving)/ADAS (advanced\ndriving assistance system) developments in the US and Japan. As a result, consolidated sales totaled ¥35,042\nmillion (up 24.4% YoY), a record high. This broke down as domestic sales of ¥31,660 million (up 22.6%) and\noverseas sales (mainly to the US and China) of ¥3,382 million (up 43.5%).\nIn terms of profit, the Company saw a substantial year-on-year increase thanks to a boost from top line growth,\na change in the business mix and higher gross margin from large high-margin projects. Operating profit came to\n¥3,366 million (up 128.6% YoY), ordinary profit was ¥3,375 million (up 87.4%) and profit attributable to owners\nof parent was ¥2,522 million (up 64.4%).\nROE for the full year was 9.0%, a sharp improvement on the 5.3% in the previous fiscal year.\nNew orders taken totaled ¥33,628 million (up 9.3% YoY) following significant growth in the Mechatronics /\nNoise & Vibration / Sensors segment as well as order expansion in the ICT / Information Security segment and\nthe Ocean / Defense & Security segment. However, the order backlog was ¥17,032 million (down 6.2%) due to\nprogress in booking sales in the Physics / Energies segment.\n(ICT / Information Security)\nIn the ICT / Information Security business, network performance testing for major communications carriers in the\nICT field and new business in mobile mapping systems saw growth. Furthermore, sales were brisk with service\nproviders in the cyber security field. As a result, sales increased by 12.5% year-on-year to ¥7,481 million and\nsegment profit was ¥388 million (up 52.6%).\n(Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors)\nIn the Mechatronics / Noise & Vibration / Sensors segment, sales and profit rose sharply thanks to the booking of\nsales for large-scale AD/ADAS development projects in the VILS field (Vehicle-in-the-loop simulation, a testing\nand evaluation methodology which utilizes both real vehicles and virtual simulations) in Japan and overseas as\nwell as steady performance in noise and vibration equipment. Profit margins also improved following price\nrevisions, resulting in sharp increases in sales and profit. Sales rose by 63.1% YoY to ¥7,664 million and segment\nprofit was ¥1,595 million (up 328.6%).\n(Physics / Energies)\nIn the Physics / Energies segment, both net sales and segment profit increased significantly as both basic\nelectrochemical measurement systems and battery charging measurement system projects were very brisk thanks\nto tailwinds from the Green Innovation Fund, which supports government-backed R&D projects aimed at\ndecarbonization. A further boost was provided from the introduction of a new measurement solution, which\ndelivers an evaluation bench for electric propulsion systems for air mobility. As a result, sales rose 43.7% YoY to\n¥9,909 million and segment profit was ¥2,106 million (up 39.1%).\n(EMC & Antenna Systems)\nIn the EMC & Antenna Systems segment, despite the boost to sales from the acquisition and consolidation of\nTOYO EMC Engineering, sales and profits in the segment declined compared to the same period of the previous\nyear due to delays in securing large domestic EMC system projects and delays in sales of in-house developed\nproducts. As a result, sales declined by 13.8% YoY to ¥4,681 million and the segment profit was ¥237 million\n(down 13.4%).\n13\n(Ocean / Defense & Security)\nIn the Ocean Defense & Security segment, sales increased year-on-year thanks to the booking of sales for a\nlarge project and steady progress in inspections in other projects also. Furthermore, segment margins improved\ndue to price revisions made in response to the weaker yen. As a result, sales increased 29.7% YoY to ¥2,261\nmillion and the segment profit was ¥461 million (up 69.2%).\n(Software Quality & Productivity)\nIn the Software Quality & Productivity segment, sales were solid to game companies such as version control\ntools for game development, driving segment sales. However, the gross margin declined due to an impact from\nyen depreciation, and the selling, general and administrative costs rose in line with an increase in personnel.\nAs a result, net sales increased by 8.4% YoY to ¥2,128 million and the segment profit was ¥406 million (down\n3.9%).\n(Life Science)\nIn the Life Science segment, both sales and segment profit increased thanks to steady sales of orthopedic\ndigital planning tools at consolidated subsidiary Lexi Co., Ltd. As a result, net sales increased by 16.5% YoY\nto ¥916 million and segment profit was ¥82 million (up 162.7%).\n14\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n(As of September 30, 2024)\n(Thousands of yen)\nAccount Title Amount Account Title Amount\nAssets Liabilities\nCurrent assets 18,423,413 Current liabilities 9,883,419\nNotes and accounts payable -\nCash and deposits 3,091,691 1,683,336\ntrade\nNotes and accounts receivable -\n6,228,715 Income taxes payable 591,671\ntrade, and contract assets\nElectronically recorded monetary\n341,262 Contract liabilities 3,020,506\nclaims – operating\nSecurities 1,941,892 Short-term loan payable 2,000,000\nMerchandise and finished goods 3,997,606 Provision for bonuses 1,091,071\nPrepaid Expenses 1,966,625 Provision for directors’ bonuses 110,000\nOther 857,819 Other 1,386,834\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (2,200) Non-current liabilities 1,123,131\nNon-current assets 20,710,745 Net defined benefit liability 810,454\nProperty, plant and equipment 13,090,595 Other 312,677\nBuildings and structures 889,874 Total liabilities 11,006,550\nVehicles 2,733 Net assets\nTools, furniture and fixtures 954,420 Shareholders’ equity 28,182,273\nLand 4,714,388 Capital stock 4,158,000\nConstruction in progress 6,529,178 Capital surplus 4,611,997\nIntangible assets 2,548,490 Retained earnings 25,242,691\nGoodwill 1,561,894 Treasury stock (5,830,415)\nAccumulated other\nSoftware 858,458 (180,099)\ncomprehensive income\nValuation difference on\nSoftware in progress 22,777 17,401\navailable-for-sale securities\nDeferred gains or losses on\nOther 105,360 (94,863)\nhedges\nForeign currency translation\nInvestments and other assets 5,071,660 (147,017)\nadjustments\nRemeasurements of defined\nInvestment securities 2,414,795 44,379\nbenefit plans\nNet defined benefit asset 720,998 Subscription rights to shares 77,998\nEquity of non-controlling\nDeferred tax assets 812,429 47,436\nshareholder\nLong-term time deposits 700,141\nOther 456,444\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (33,149) Total net assets 28,127,608\nTotal assets 39,134,159 Total liabilities and net assets 39,134,159\nNote: Amounts are rounded down to the nearest thousand yen.\n15\nConsolidated Statement of Income\n(From October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024)\n(Thousands of yen)\nAccount Title Amount\nNet sales 35,042,582\nCost of sales 19,860,311\nGross profit 15,182,271\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 11,816,190\nOperating income 3,366,080\nNon-operating income\nInterest income 51,731\nDividend income 18,236\nOutsourcing fee 30,052\nInsurance cancellation refund 25,231\nOther 31,996 157,248\nNon-operating expenses\nInterest expenses 6,340\nCommission for purchase of treasury stock 2,066\nLoss on investments in investment partnerships 15,964\nShare of loss of entities accounted for using equity method 15,530\nCurrency exchange loss 106,943\nOther 1,013 147,860\nOrdinary income 3,375,469\nExtraordinary income\nGain on step acquisitions 3,281\nGain on sales of non-current assets 3,509,184\nGain on sales of investment securities 10,054 3,522,521\nExtraordinary losses\nImpairment loss 304,210\nLoss on disposal of non-current assets 31,650\nLoss on reduction of non-current assets 3,241,737 3,577,599\nIncome before income taxes 3,320,391\nIncome taxes -
