You must not destroy or\nalter any such records in your possession or control. You must also affirmatively preserve from destruction all relevant\nrecords that without intervention would automatically be destroyed or erased (such as e-mails and voicemail messages).\nDestruction of such records, even if inadvertent, could seriously prejudice the Company.

The prohibition against trading securities while in possession of material\nnonpublic information (\"insider trading\") and “tipping” others about material nonpublic information\napplies to purchases and sales of securities of other publicly traded companies if you learn material\nnonpublic information about other companies, such as those that do business with the Company or\nwith whom the Company is negotiating, in the course of your duties for Deswell.

A person violating the Company's insider trading policy will be subject to disciplinary\naction up to and including termination and civil penalty.\n1.7 International Business\nAll employees are expected to comply with the laws of the country in which they operate and this\nCode. If a local law conflicts with a policy in this Code, you must consult the Board of Directors or the\ndelegated to determine the appropriate course of action.\n2. Company Property\n2.1 Use of Company Assets\n5\nThe protection and proper use of Company assets are of vital importance and are considered to be the\nresponsibility of each employee.

A delay of one or two\nbusiness days is generally considered a sufficient period for routine information to be absorbed by the market. Nevertheless, a longer\nperiod of delay might be considered appropriate in more complex disclosures.\n-\nInsider trading is a crime and the SEC may seek the imposition of a civil penalty of up to three times the profits made or losses\navoided from the trading. Insider traders must also disgorge any profits made, and are often subjected to an injunction against future\nviolations. (Source: Section 21A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") [15 U.S.C. 78u-l(e) ] issued by the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission) Finally, insider traders may be subjected to civil liability in private lawsuits.\nCompany assets include building, machinery, computers, internet connections, inventory and products, catalogues, brochures,\nproduct descriptions, customer lists, pricing lists, business plans, transactions analysis, software, Bill of Material (BOM), technical\nknow-how and all other documents, writings, copies and databases used or relied upon in one’s employment.

General Personal Conduct and Interface with customers and suppliers\n3.1 Conflicts of Interest\nCompany employees, officers and directors are expected to dedicate their best efforts to Company\n7\nbusiness and to be mindful of any conflicts with the interests of the Company. Your obligation to\nconduct the Company's business in an honest and ethical manner includes the ethical handling of\nactual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and business relationships. The following are\nsome common examples that depending upon your particular responsibilities, may create a potential\nconflict-of-interest situation:\n⚫ Serving as a director, representative, employee, partner, consultant or agent of an enterprise that is a supplier,\ncustomer or competitor of the Company, or that engages in any other business with the Company;\n⚫ Owning a material amount of stock in, being a creditor of or having other financial interest in a supplier, customer or\ncompetitor;\n⚫ Gifts, gratuities, special allowances, discounts, or other benefits not generally available, received from or given to a\nsupplier, customer or competitor;\n⚫ Any other direct or indirect personal interest or interest of a family member in a transaction involving the Company;\n⚫ Obtaining or using for personal benefit confidential information regarding a supplier, customer or competitor, or\nConfidential Information includes, but is not limited to, decisions, plans, procedures, personal data on employees, customer and\nsupplier information including proposals and pricing, contractual terms and arrangements, financial or business results, evaluations,\nanalyses and forecasts or any non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its customers,\nif disclosed.\nA conflict of interest occurs when your private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere, with the interests of the\nCompany. A conflict situation can arise when you take actions or have interests that make it difficult for you to perform your\ncompany work objectively and effectively.\n5 -\nCode of Business Conducts and Ethics\nDOCUMENT NO.: CP01/05\nproviding confidential information regarding the Company or its business to a supplier, customer or competitor;\n⚫ Appropriating for personal benefit a business opportunity that the Company might reasonably have an interest in\npursuing, without first making the opportunity available to the Company;\n⚫ Outside activities that materially detract from or interfere with the full and timely performance by an employee of his\nor her services for the Company.\n3.2 Competitive Intelligence\nTo effectively compete in the business world requires an understanding of competitors’ strategies. In\ncollecting data on its competitors, the Company utilizes all legitimate sources, but avoids any actions\nwhich are illegal, unethical, or which would cause embarrassment.\n3.3 Fair Dealing\nEvery employee, including officers and directors, is required to deal fairly with the Company’s\ncustomers, suppliers, competitors and employees.
