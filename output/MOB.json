          "content": "Letter to shareholders – Delisting conversion process update\n12 October 2023\nDear Shareholder,\nFurther to our previous notification concerning the Delisting of Mobilicom Limited (the Company) from the\nAustralian Stock Exchange (ASX), we wish to provide the following additional information concerning the\nprocess for conversion of your shares into American Depositary Shares (ADS) prior to the Delisting\nDate.\nIf you choose to wait until after the Delisting Date of 19th October 2023 to convert your shares to\nADS, a different process will apply. Details to be provided with your share certificate which will be\nposted within 2-3 business days of delisting.\nDo I need to have a US broker to be able to convert to ADS?\nIn order to settle any sale of ADSs you are issued you will need to have an account with a US broker who\nis a DTC Participant and who can hold the ADS on your behalf in DTC. It is possible to have the ADS\nregistered into your own name, however holding the securities via a US broker is considered the most\nefficient from an investor perspective (refer to the section below for information in respect of this option).\nWhat is DTC?\nDTC is the Depository Trust Company, and is the standard electronic settlement system for equity\nsecurities in the US. Similar to the CHESS settlement system in Australia, broker participants use DTC to\nsettle trades and hold securities on behalf of their clients.\nI do not have an account with a US Broker. How do I get one?\nAs a first step you can talk to your Australian broker to see if they can assist, as many offer trading and\nsettlement options for international securities. Your Australian broker may have a relationship with a US\nbroker, which would allow you to establish and account.\nOtherwise, you could visit the:\nMoomoo Website - click here and establish an account.\nPlease note this is for information only. We are not providing a recommendation. You should make your\nown enquiries to determine whether they suit your requirements.\nOnce I have the account with a US broker, what should I do?\n(a) Prior to Delisting from ASX\nIf you are a shareholder whose shares are held in a holding sponsored by your broker, after you have\nestablished your account (or if you had an existing account) you can ask that they make arrangements\nwith HSBC Australia, the Australian custodian appointed to hold shares on behalf of the Bank of New\nYork Mellon, the issuer of the ADS, to transfer your shares to HSBC. Your broker will also have to provide\nHSBC with details of the ADS delivery instructions: the name of your US broker, the broker's DTC\nParticipant number and your account number with that US broker.\nIf you have established an account with Moomoo, the DTC details are shown below:\nDTC Participant Firm Name: Futu Clearing Inc.\nDTC Participant ID: 4272\nDTC Account Number: 6801014\nClient ID: (This will be provided to you by Moomoo once your account is established.)\nHolder Account Name - DTC participant/broker: FUTU Securities (AU) Ltd\nEmail Address of the DTC participant/broker: transfers@futuclearing.com\nOnce BNY Mellon receives confirmation from HSBC that your underlying ordinary shares have been\ndeposited, new ADSs are issued and delivered to your nominated U.S. broker, in accordance with the\nprogram's \"Deposit Agreement\". To help facilitate this process, BNY Mellon has agreed to waive the ADS\nissuance fees until 30 November for investors.\nIf your shares are not held in a holding sponsored by a broker but are held on the Issuer Sponsored sub-\nregister, you will need to complete the form previously provided. You must include on the form all of the\nrequested information; including the DTC Participant number and your account number. Return that form\nto the Company's share registrar; Boardroom Pty Limited. Please do not send the form directly to the\nADS issuer (the Bank of New York Mellon) or their Australian custodian (HSBC). The Company's registrar\nwill check the form for correct completion and, if appropriate, pass the information onto the Bank of New\nYork Mellon, the ADS issuer.\n(b) After delisting from ASX\nYou will be contacted after the proposed Delisting date of 19 October 2023 with further instructions.\nI want the ADS to be registered into my name\nConversion of Mobilcom ordinary shares into ADSs can be registered under the investor?s name (non-\nbroker account) in the Direct Registration System (DRS).\nWhat is the Direct Registration System (DRS)?\nUnder DRS, you can elect to have your ADS securities registered directly on the ADS records in book-\nentry form. With DRS, you do not receive a physical certificate. Instead, you will receive periodic account\nstatements (at least yearly) from the ADS registry, Computershare.\nWhat do I have to do\nIf you are unable to open a US brokerage account, please provide name and address in the ADS delivery\ninstructions section of the transfer form submitted to Boardroom.\nBoardroom will check the form and pass the information onto the relevant party for processing.\nOnce BNY Mellon (the ADS issuer) receives confirmation that your ordinary shares have been deposited\nwith your name and address, BNY Mellon will issue the ADSs in your name and address in the Direct\nRegistration System (DRS) of the ADS registrar Computershare. DRS advice will be mailed to the\naddress on record confirming the credit of the ADSs.\nNote: ADSs held in this form can be more of an administrative burden for investors (and take longer to\nsell) compared to ADSs held via a US broker in DTC.\nCopies of relevant forms are attached to this announcement.\nAbout Mobilicom\nMobilicom is a leading provider of cybersecure robust solutions for the rapidly growing defense and\ncommercial drones and robotics market.

          "content": "Corporate\nPresentation\nSeptember 2024\nNASDAQ: MOB\n1\nForward Looking Statements\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation of the Company contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and other securities\nlaws. Words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates\" and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to\nidentify forward-looking statements. For example, the Company is using forward-looking statements when it discusses market size forecasts, strategy, market\nposition and ability to compete, anticipated developments in its operations and future financial and operating performance. Forward-looking statements are not\nhistorical facts, and are based upon management's current expectations, beliefs and projections, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain. Such\nexpectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith. However, there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections\nwill be achieved and actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the\nforward-looking statements including the Company’s ability to implement its strategies, its competitive advantages, the development of new products and\nservices, the impact of competitors, changes in laws, rules and regulations, its ability to maintain its product certifications, its ability to maintain good relationships\nwith customers, suppliers and other strategic partners, its ability to protect its intellectual property, its ability to retain key personnel and the absence of material\nadverse changes in the industry or global economy. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting the Company, reference is made to the\nCompany's Registration Statement on Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Before you invest you should read the\npreliminary prospectus in that registration statement for more complete information about the Company and the offering.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to\nreflect actual results, subsequent events or circumstances, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information except to the\nextent required by applicable securities laws. If the Company does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that the\nCompany will make additional updates with respect thereto or with respect to other forward-looking statements.\n2\nNasdaq:MOB\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition • A significant growth in the number of personnel would place a strain upon our management and\n• We have a history of losses. resources.\n• We expect that we will need to invest significant time and raise substantial additional capital • We are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations in other countries.\nbefore we can expect to become profitable from sales of our products.
