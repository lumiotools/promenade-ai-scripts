Before that, with an MBA from Kellogg, I worked for more than a decade on Wall Street with several banks, notably Goldman Sachs.\n\nBut over the past 15 years, I have been an editor, analyst, and now senior partner and board member of MarketWise. My affiliation with this company stretches back to 2004, when our founder and outgoing CEO, Porter Stansberry, convinced me to consult with Stansberry Research. Soon after my residency in Ophthalmology, in 2008, I joined him and the company full-time. \n\nToday, my team and I produce the investment advisories Retirement Millionaire, Retirement Trader, Income Intelligence, and Prosperity Investor, as well as the daily letter called The Health and Wealth Bulletin.\n\nAs you may know, Porter announced his decision to step away from the CEO and Chairman positions on Friday. Now, the MarketWise board has asked me to step into the role of interim CEO.\n\nAs I mentioned, MarketWise currently faces a number of challenges that I’m confident we can overcome by continuing some of the initiatives Porter was working on and tackling a few other forward-looking items. I want you to understand where I will be focusing my attention and the energies of our company.\n\nWhile we are making lots of fundamental progress, these efforts have not yet materialized in our financial results. Worse, in February, we uncovered serious mismanagement inside our Legacy Research business. We opted to dissolve that business, which has resulted in a big decline in revenue and operational changes that have demanded the attention of our top executives. Fortunately, the wind-down of Legacy Research is now largely complete. It’s time to again focus on our mission to reassert MarketWise as the leading platform for high-quality, independent investment research.\n\nHere’s where we are now.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, MarketWise generated net income of $21.2 million on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net revenue of $105.0 million. This compares with last year’s second-quarter net income of $9.7 million on GAAP net revenue of $103.6 million. Our Paid Subscriber file size was 645,259 as of June 30, 2024, compared with 750,287 as of June 30, 2023.\n\nIn prior letters, we have described our ongoing efforts to review our products, people, and processes to ensure we are delivering high-quality and valuable research and products. Underpinning everything is trust and credibility, and our commitment to being good stewards of your trust.\n\nWhere we go from here: a return to our original strategy\n\nIn his first letter to shareholders in November 2023 after returning as CEO, Porter laid out the principles upon which he built our business. At our core is the fundamental idea that: \n\n“Our culture of putting the subscribers first – even if doing so harms our revenues (in the short term) or even when doing so may put us in jeopardy of offending powerful corporate and political interests – has allowed us to attract dedicated customers and talented financial analysts.”\n\nNothing about that vision will change. We remain dedicated to a few simple principles that might seem naive to “professional” money managers.\n\nWe want to give investors the information we’d most want to know, if our roles were reversed. We believe that doing so, consistently, is the key to earning our customers’ trust. This well-earned trust is the real secret to our business. As Porter once wrote:\n\nSticking with our founding principles allowed us to create what Charlie Munger would have described as a “virtuous circle.” Producing consistently valuable research and having a totally transparent business model (no conflicts of interest), allowed us to attract and retain both valuable customers and the most talented analysts. More affluent and sophisticated customers led to bigger editorial budgets and higher and higher quality research, which attracted still more customers. And at the root of this success was the earned trust of our customers. \n\nThis isn’t hypothetical. Over 25 years in business, we’ve achieved fantastic results following this formula.\n\nBy the end of 2017, Stansberry Research - one of MarketWise's subsidiaries - was producing Billings in excess of $100 million with extremely strong margins. It did so with very little capital, because it was a business based on earned trust. Most of our profits came from renewal income, not new sales. We produced a return on invested capital that year that was tremendous.\n\nBy 2020, we were producing Billings in excess of $548 million, but our return on invested capital declined by nearly half. In 2021, the “COVID bubble” year, Billings reached an incredible $730 million, but despite this massive increase, our return on invested capital declined further. \n\nAcross virtually all of our brands, we lowered our prices, increased our marketing spending, and chased one hot investment fad after another – no matter how risky or ridiculous. We also adopted a host of marketing tactics (endless upsell funnels, huge quantities of email promotions, dozens of co-registrations) that drove near-term revenue at the expense of lifetime value. Driving your best customers away with aggressive marketing only works for a short period of time.\n\nThese changes produced huge amounts of churn in our subscriber files and brought to our business exactly the wrong kind of customers. When you do what’s best for the customer, you attract high-quality customers and employees; when you do the opposite, the opposite occurs.\n\nMaking progress\n\nWhat we are doing today is trying to produce higher per-share intrinsic value. \n\nWe believe the best way for us to do that is by creating high-quality investment research brands, like Stansberry Research. We’ve changed the compensation structure across the company to reward executives who can produce high margin renewal income. We’re going to reward people for earning the trust of our customers and building sustainable brands, not for driving revenue churn.\n\nBut it will take time because we’ve done a lot of damage to some of our brands, and we’ve undermined some of the trust that took us decades to build. It will also take time because we are not going to be driven purely by marketing decisions, but instead by the hard rule that we only do what we genuinely believe is in the best interest of our customers. So, for example, rather than piling into the mania for Nvidia this summer, we published a timely warning that the market for tech stocks was \n\nabout to crash. (See July 12 Stansberry Digest [1] and my Income Intelligence issue from July 18, titled “I Can’t Bite My Tongue Any Longer” [2])\n\nPart of our strategy includes acquiring other outstanding financial brands, when we can get them at a fair price. We want to make MarketWise the holding company of choice for excellent independent financial writers.\n\nWe have also completed the relaunch of Wide Moat Research. The business is led by Brad Thomas, who has long been among the widely read real estate investors in the world. Brad is also famously well-connected to Donald Trump, having written a book about the former president’s real estate empire. We believe that working closely with Brad, we’ll be able to build an extremely high-quality and high-margin research group that’s focused on real estate and other blue-chip investments.\n\nLikewise, Porter successfully recruited Jeff Brown back to Brownstone Research and promoted him to become a partner in the business. Jeff’s resume in technology is unmatched by any other financial newsletter writer, having been a senior executive at Qualcomm, NXP Semiconductor, and Juniper Networks. We’re confident that no one has written to more technology investors over the last decade with more skill than Jeff Brown. We intend to rebuild Brownstone Research into the highest-quality source of tech investment research in the world.\n\nFinally, at the end of the second quarter we also launched a new “ultra-premium\" global travel and financial research club called The MarketWise Fellowship (marketwisefellowship.com). We’d encourage all shareholders to check out this group. \n\nWe believe that these efforts will begin to yield new Billings and profitability beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and growing substantially next year.\n\nOur plan is to focus our efforts on providing high-quality investment research across our customers’ investment lifetimes. By focusing on the customer’s experience and providing a long-term customer journey in our brands, we can maximize the utility of our products for our customers and maximize their lifetime value to our business.\n\nCapital Allocation\n\nAfter fixing the focus toward better customers, implementing a matching incentive structure, and building (and rebuilding) our brands, my most important goal is making sure that we re-invest our earnings wisely, or distribute them if no such opportunities present themselves.\n\nWe are also exploring a range of ways we might repurchase a large number of our shares. Whether or not this happens, you should know that I have more than 6 million reasons to do everything I can to improve the intrinsic value per share of our company.\n\nThe next best investment we can make is acquiring similar high-quality brands in our industry, where we can use our marketing know-how, technology, and distribution network to rapidly grow the acquired business. The relaunch of Wide Moat, and re-signing of Jeff Brown at Brownstone Research are just our first two examples. While these moves include small amounts of shares (for bonuses and incentives) they were essentially all-cash deals that we believe will be extremely accretive on a per share basis. \n\n[1] https://members.stansberryresearch.com/articles/stansberry-digest/a-warning-from-porter-stansberry\n\n[2] https://members.stansberryresearch.com/articles/income-intelligence/i-cant-bite-my-tongue-any-longer\n\nWhen we execute well our company can produce hundreds of millions of dollars in float, which is capital we will eventually have to pay in taxes but can be invested profitably in the interim. Currently, we remain invested 100% in only short-term fixed-income assets, but we look forward to the day when we find more attractive opportunities in other long-term investments. Of course, we also need to return to growth to increase the size of this float, which we expect will begin to decrease this year as various taxes come due. \n\nI thank you for your interest in our company and the trust you’ve placed in me as the company’s CEO. I look forward to updating you on our progress in November. \n\nSincerely, \n\nDavid “Doc” Eifrig\n\nP.S. I would be remiss in not thanking our outgoing Chairman and CEO Porter Stansberry for his leadership, vision, and assistance in this past year. I’m excited to have him on the board, in a place where we can continue our business fellowship and our nearly 20-year friendship: thank you Porter.\n"

          "content": "EX-99.1 2 a1q2024marketwiseceoletter.htm EX-99.1  Document\n\nMarketWise Inc.\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nTo the Shareholders of MarketWise, Inc.:\n\nRonald Reagan was an optimist. \n\nOne of his favorite jokes was about a little boy, who, on Christmas morning, came down to discover nothing under the tree but a large pile of manure. His parents were shocked to find him enthusiastically shoveling the manure out from under the tree. The boy, smiling ear to ear, said: “Isn’t this great! With all this manure in the house, there’s got to be a pony down here somewhere!” \n\nI’m an optimist too. Let’s start shoveling. \n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, MarketWise generated net income of $22.7 million on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net revenue of $109.0 million. This compares with last year’s first-quarter net income of $30.6 million on GAAP net revenue of $126.2 million. Our Paid Subscriber file size was 683,000 as of March 31, 2024, compared with 777,000 as of March 31, 2023.\n\nThere’s gotta be a pony down here somewhere. \n\nClearing a Path to Growth\n\nOur business continues to work through the impact of the “Covid bubble.” \n\nDuring 2020-2021, we experienced a huge increase in response to our marketing efforts as many investors, some for the very first time, entered the financial markets. This led our publishers to spend unprecedented amounts of money on marketing and brought to our company a huge number of new subscribers.\n\nAs I’ve explained in previous letters, these new subscribers were “stimulus check-sporting speculators chasing momentum.” And “like the tide,” they washed into our business and then, just as quickly, receded. While our marketers spent aggressively to add these subscribers, this large cohort of new subscribers didn’t convert into long-term customers at anything like the expected rate. This left our company with disappointing results in 2022 and 2023. \n\nIn October of 2023, I returned to the company after nearly a three-year absence. \n\nMy immediate focus was on normalizing our operations to restore our margins and, ideally, return us to profitable growth. We reduced General and Administrative costs by more than $4 million, or about 15%, on a year-over-year basis. We eliminated poorly performing products. And across our entire company, we reduced staffing levels substantially. Our headcount declined more than 20% from 672 as of September 30, 2023, to 535 as of the end of April 2024.\n\nI was hopeful that after these difficult decisions, I’d be able to spend the first quarter working exclusively on growth initiatives. But as Warren Buffett is fond of saying, “only when the tide goes out do you learn who has been swimming naked.” \n\nAs I disclosed in my last letter, we had to wind down and reorganize one of our three main publishing groups because of serious departures from our ethical standards, including an editor who was being paid surreptitiously to recommend low-quality stocks to our readers. We are still in the process of strategically realigning and reorganizing our Legacy Research Group business (Legacy Research) and transitioning Legacy Research customers to comparable products within other MarketWise brands. I expect most of this work to be essentially complete in the first half of this year. \n\nThe direct consequences of this realignment will be expensive. The billings from the Legacy Research business, which were already in rapid decline throughout 2023, declined from $30 million in Q4 2023 to $16 million in Q1 2024. We expect these revenues will continue to decline for some time. As a result, even if we’re able to make substantial progress in our other brands, we will, most likely, still see further declines in our key metrics (Paid Subscriber size, Billings, and Renewal Billings) in 2024. \n\nThe direct impact of the Legacy Research situation can be seen in our quarterly Billings. After a period of stabilization in our Billings, we experienced a meaningful decline in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n![quarterlybillings.jpg](quarterlybillings.jpg)\n\nThe reality for our shareholders is that we have a lot of work to do to replace the customers, the Billings, and the Renewal Billings we have lost because of the failures at Legacy Research. I assure you that is happening with urgency. I’ll detail some of those efforts below. \n\nFirst, though, I am pleased to report only one thing about this entire situation. Unlike previous management, we have not paid extra for failure.\n\nThe managers and senior personnel who failed in their obligation to supervise the employees at Legacy Research were terminated.\n\nAdditionally, we bought back all the MarketWise equity owned by two of Legacy Research’s senior managers who were terminated. In total, the Company repurchased 7.2 million MarketWise LLC units at a discount to the market (and at a wide discount from our own estimate of intrinsic value) for a total cost of $10.8 million. Buying this equity is in line with our broader capital-allocation strategy will reward our shareholders, and allows us to move on from these problems. It is important to note that the purchases will not impact our public float, because we purchased LLC Units (not Class A Common Stock). \n\nI believe this sets an important new precedent in our Company: We aren’t going to reward anyone for failure and, if you do anything to hurt our customers, we will be ruthless.\n\nNew Growth Initiatives\n\nWe believe transparent free markets are the most powerful engine for human cooperation. They are the key to creating a wealthier and more peaceful world.\n\nAt MarketWise, our mission is to explain the transformative power of free markets and to teach individuals how to use them effectively to empower and enrich their lives. \n\nWhen we do this well, I believe the results are frequently exceptional, both for our subscribers and for our shareholders. \n\nAt the core of our business is the exceptional value proposition we offer to investors. The information our analysts produce can be extraordinarily valuable; yet we offer it for nominal subscription rates that are a pittance compared with the wealth that can be produced through investing in these ideas. The result is a scalable business that’s capable of producing high returns on invested capital.\n\nAs we look to rebuild our business from the troubles at Legacy Research, we will focus on our existing brands that have a proven ability to both attract and retain valuable subscribers. We will also continue to acquire similar businesses where there is a proven track record of excellent editorial that we can introduce to our large audience. \n\nOur goal in building these businesses is to earn our customers’ continuing subscription and membership fees over an investment lifetime. We’re going to judge our success going forward, not merely by the initial billings (produced by marketing) but instead by the growth of recurring revenues. \n\nI’m pleased to tell you that we’re launching a few of these kinds of high-quality businesses into MarketWise over the next few weeks.\n\nWe are re-launching Brownstone Research, which was, until recently, a leading franchise within MarketWise. Jeff Brown is one of the most recognized and trusted voices for investors in new technologies. At certain points over the last decade, Brownstone Research was among our very best businesses, both in terms of its financial results and in the quality of its products. Jeff left the business in early 2023 because of conflicts with our previous management team. \n\nI am very excited to announce Jeff’s return to our company. I believe this franchise will soon grow into one of our biggest and best businesses. \n\nI have also worked hard to relaunch Wide Moat Research, whose founder, Brad Thomas, has long been the most widely read expert in America on real estate investing through REITS. We intend to work with Brad to expand Wide Moat’s branded coverage to include long-term investing across the entire financial landscape. \n\nThese new (and re-born) franchises will be characterized by a few simple attributes: \n\n1.Ultra-high-quality content, designed to serve real investors at premium subscription rates.\n\n2.Analysts with decades of experience and bona fide expertise to share with their readers.\n\n3.Marketing campaigns designed to build brand value and provide immediate return on investment.\n\nThese new franchises, along with our existing franchises, position MarketWise to build an extraordinary business in the years ahead. \n\nWith the talent we have in our company, with our incredible content libraries, with our large Subscriber files, and with our proprietary technologies, we have the opportunity to create an entirely new kind of consumer financial service company. \n\nUnlike mainstream publishers, we are not beholden to advertisers. Unlike financial firms, we do not depend on (or collect) any kind of underwriting fees. And unlike individual fiduciaries, we do not craft our products to suit the expectations or the investment style of individual customers. Instead, we can craft investment research products and risk management tools that are optimized for the markets as we find them, pursuing results for our subscribers without fear or favor. \n\nNewspapers, magazines, encyclopedias — virtually every form of publishing that historically relied on direct response marketing has nearly disappeared during the last 25 years. But our company flourished. Why? Because while our business form may have been publishing, we were not selling entertainment or news. We’ve educated an entire generation of investors, investors who, like us, have been independent from the beginning. \n\nThe business that pioneered this model, Stansberry Research, never looked like a traditional financial newsletter. Stansberry Research’s products were primarily designed to be used by individuals, folks who wanted to do their own research and manage their own assets.\n\nStansberry Research’s evolution followed other changes in the market for financial services. In the 1990s, people began to think about investing in new ways. It started with online brokers offering much cheaper forms of trading and allowing individuals to effectively become their own portfolio managers. Those changes continued with an explosion in exchange-traded funds. \n\nToday, people are picking what they invest in and who they invest with as an expression of their own mindsets and values. Think about how using Robinhood, for example, says something about you as a person and as an investor far more than who you chose to use as your broker would have back in the 1980s or 1990s. \n\nThis ongoing “democratization” of finance is a major opportunity for us. The public no longer sees investing as something that can only happen in some Ivy Tower called “Wall Street.” More and more, people see investing as part of their identity. And more and more, people want to invest alongside a community that shares their beliefs and their values. \n\nMarketWise will continue to be a leader of this trend by helping people identify who they are as investors by joining our brands as members. Going forward, far more of our marketing spending will be focused on this kind of branding and by offering tools and research products designed for specific types of investors.\n\nTo further our company’s pursuit of leadership in these ongoing trends, it’s critical that we change our compensation structure to align our company’s incentives with our strategic goals.\n\nOur New Compensation Structure\n\nWe have, historically, paid our most valuable employees (our leading writers) with fully vested, annual cash bonuses based on fixed-rate royalty payments. \n\nMany of these payments were not based on net income, but instead, on net Billings. Thus, the value of these payments depended heavily on marketing spending. \n\nAs a result, our employees have had an incentive to produce marketing campaigns that maximized marketing spending, even when those sales did not produce any return. These incentives, which were common in the industry, were particularly insidious for our company because we depend, entirely, on attracting investors who will renew and upgrade their subscriptions with our various operating companies over the long term. Thus, there’s been a long-standing mismatch between our company’s most important strategic goal and our employee’s incentives.\n\nThe result? Inefficient marketing spending. \n\nAn analysis of our marketing spending over the last several years shows that we spent hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing offering investment ideas to people at $49. While it must be said that some of our analysts saw these higher-risk recommendations provide truly incredible results for subscribers, it will not surprise any of our shareholders that selling such ideas at $49 to folks looking for lottery tickets doesn’t often lead to satisfied customers happy to pay up for high-quality, reliable, and sophisticated financial research. \n\nAs a result, most of these initial sales didn’t create any further business. And overall, the entire cohort of subscribers who entered our business at the $49 price didn’t produce any return for our company. \n\nSolving this problem requires more than better marketing managers. We will never get the kind of marketing we need if our incentives are structured the way they are now. I can’t blame our employees for doing exactly what we incentivized them to do. Thus, I have restructured the entire compensation regime at the company. \n\nI started at the top. \n\nRather than simply paying a fixed royalty bonus based on net income, our senior operators will now be paid primarily in the form of a salary. Their bonuses will be derived from a formula that rewards revenue growth combined with operating margin. We will no longer pay for growth at any cost. \n\nSalaries for these senior operators will be set according to the scope of their business’s “renewal file.” That’s measured by adding up the annual billings derived from ongoing subscriptions or memberships, amortized appropriately. In this way, our senior operators will only have incentive to grow our repeat business, through marketing that’s efficient. Additionally, all bonus and incentive pay, across the entire company (with only a few exceptions), will be paid half in cash and half in stock, with a four-year vesting schedule. \n\nUnderneath these senior employees, everyone else in the company will be put into a salary band and will receive a specific key performance metric (KPM) to determine their annual bonus. Hopefully the wisdom of these changes will be obvious to you: We should reward our employees according to the specific contributions they make to our company, not solely according to the results of our marketing efforts.\n\nFinally, in addition to rewarding our employees with shares (in lieu of cash) as part of their bonus pay, I plan to reward all of our employees with an initial grant of stock on July 1. All of our employees will be eligible for additional grants of stock each year provided that both their operating group and MarketWise as a whole produces an increase in our internal estimate of per-share intrinsic value. \n\nWe do not believe these changes will materially increase our annual cash compensation costs or have a materially dilutive effect on our shareholders.\n\nI believe, when this chapter of our company’s history is written, these changes to compensation will be viewed as the single most important shift in strategy that led to our subsequent success. As a company, we can easily afford to be generous to all our employees and we can afford to pay up for great talent. What we can’t afford to do (and what I will not tolerate) is rewarding failure.\n\nCapital Allocation \n\nOur recent results have been poor. Thus, it might surprise you to know that I believe my most important job is capital allocation. I expect our results to improve dramatically and our company to produce far more cash than we can efficiently invest in our business, as has been the case almost every year I’ve been in this business. \n\nWhat we decide to do with our cash flows will be critical to determining whether MarketWise is merely a good business or can become a great business.\n\nWe have four choices: We can invest in building our own brands and acquiring similar businesses; we can repurchase our own shares; we can invest in other industries; or we can pay cash dividends. \n\nBuying back our shares at a wide discount from intrinsic value is, in my view, the very best use of our excess cash. However, given that so much of our stock (B-shares represent about 85% of all shares) is still privately held – and quite reluctant to sell – there simply isn’t enough of a liquid market yet to make buying shares practical. Conducting a significant buyback today in our A-shares would be tantamount to taking the company private. \n\nBeyond this instantly accretive use of capital, I am optimistic that, over time, we can use a portion of our “float” – that’s the cash that we hold on to our balance sheet from billings that haven’t yet been recognized as revenue from an accounting perspective – to make successful long-term investments in common stocks. In the meantime, we continue to enjoy the high interest rate environment by earning income of nearly $2 million during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWe plan to continue paying our regular quarterly dividend and will evaluate, at the end of the year, whether paying another special dividend is warranted. \n\nAdditional Performance Measures\n\nOur quarterly letters will always begin with our GAAP accounting results. These numbers are important and should form the basis of your evaluation of our company.\n\nIn addition to the GAAP numbers, I believe you should also consider the performance measures that I use to evaluate businesses like ours in the industry, which is based on Billings. I’m not suggesting my model is superior to GAAP, but I believe my intrinsic-value model is useful to evaluate our business and other potential acquisitions, primarily because of the way GAAP accounting delays revenue recognition, in some cases for five years.\n\n(In millions)| 2018| 2019| 2020| 2021| 2022| 2023| TTM 3/31/24  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNew \"Marketing\" Billings (1)| $| 192.6| $| 222.2| $| 450.0| $| 596.7| $| 333.6| $| 278.3| $| 266.3  \nNet \"Renewal\" Billings (2)| 70.4| 70.3| 90.1| 121.2| 120.3| 96.8| 89.1  \nOther (3)| 17.5| 17.6| 8.7| 12.0| 5.6| 7.4| 7.1  \nTotal Billings| $| 280.5| $| 310.1| $| 548.8| $| 729.9| $| 459.5| $| 382.4| $| 362.5  \n(1) Includes billings from all new subscription sales to new and existing subscribers.  \n(2) Includes billings attributable to renewal and maintenance fee payments. Excludes Membership sales.  \n(3) Includes primarily billings from Revenue Share, Advertising, and Conferences.  \n  \nMy model (above) is focused on “Billings,” not “Revenue.” Billings are the cash we receive when a customer buys a membership or subscription. These cash receipts become “GAAP revenue” only after they’re earned over the life of a subscription. And because most of our memberships and subscriptions have multiple-year durations, this can produce a significant “lag” between the company’s receipt of cash and its recognition of revenue.\n\nIntrinsic Value\n\nTo estimate the intrinsic value of the Company, I suggest using the different billings categories described above and ascribing a different multiple to each source of revenue.\n\nOur New or “Marketing” Billings relate to initial subscriptions and produce modest profit margins (and in good years immodest ones). When evaluating businesses in our industry, I typically assign a conservative multiple to these initial subscriptions.\n\nOn the other hand, our Renewal Billings are higher margin, and when we are doing our jobs well, should always grow. I believe few, if any, financial publishers can match our record of growing and sustaining renewals. When I evaluate companies in our industry, renewals are the most important factor. \n\nIn addition to the Billings view above, I also look at Renewals, inclusive of our Membership billings. This method of looking at the revenue side of our business is a useful measure of “repeat” revenue and our ability to both retain our customers and upgrade them to our Membership products. \n\n![annualbillings.jpg](annualbillings.jpg)\n\nIncreasing Recurring and Membership Billings is critical to increasing the overall intrinsic value of our business. As I mentioned above, the new compensation structure directly links incentives to increasing these Recurring and Membership Billings.\n\nIn closing, let me reiterate that I have confidence in the people, the products, and the processes we have in this business. Dozens of our employees worked long hours during the wind-down of Legacy Research to support our subscribers and thereby minimize the damage to our company. I’m sure most shareholders will never know how these efforts have significantly benefited our company – but I do. I’m more certain of our company’s future success today than I was at the start of this year. It’s always darkest before the dawn. But the dawn comes. \n\nI look forward to updating you on our progress in August.\n"

(NASDAQ: MKTW) (“MarketWise” or the “Company”), a leading multi-brand digital subscription services platform that provides premium financial research, software, education, and tools for self-directed investors, today reported financial results for third quarter 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights****(1)**\n\n  * Paid Subscribers were 592 thousand as of September 30, 2024 compared with 774 thousand as of September 30, 2023\n  * Total Net Revenue was $97.2 million in third quarter 2024 compared with $106.2 million in third quarter 2023\n  * Total Billings was $48.9 million in third quarter 2024 compared with $95.5 million in third quarter 2023\n  * Net Income was $22.7 million in third quarter 2024 compared with $12.0 million in third quarter 2023\n  * Cash and Cash Equivalents were $94.1 million as of September 30, 2024\n\n\n\n(1) See “Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. For a reconciliation of Adjusted CFFO and Adjusted CFFO margin, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below.\n\nDr. David “Doc” Eifrig, Interim Chief Executive Officer, commented, “I have been around this Company for two decades and have seen many business cycles and changes along the way. One thing that has remained constant is our commitment to providing high-quality independent research that empowers our customers. My deepest gratitude goes to the more than 400 employees dedicated to the experience of our subscribers. During my first 90 days, I have focused on evaluating the culture, capabilities, products, and processes at our Company. And while not yet evident in our Q3 financial results, I feel confident we are making progress.”\n\nEifrig continued, “During the third quarter, we began to optimize parts of our business, which we believe will improve revenue and margins going forward. Further, we believe our new brand launches coupled with a strong product pipeline in Q4 will result in an inflection point in our Billings, after several quarters of sequential declines. Specifically, while our average monthly Billings during Q3 were approximately $16 million, our October Billings totaled approximately $19 million. While not yet a trend, we believe seedlings like these will bear fruit. Lastly, we are in the process of advancing our strategic priorities which will guide our Company’s efforts around revenue growth, margin expansion, and inorganic opportunities. I remain bullish and honored to lead our Company and the team we have in place to deliver for our customers, shareholders, and employees. We sell trust and honest ideas with innovative technology to help our subscribers learn, invest, and lead a healthier and wealthier life.”\n\n**YTD 3Q 2024 Highlights****(****1)**\n\n  * Total Net Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $311.2 million, a decrease of 7% compared with the same period in prior year.\n  * Total Billings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $183.7 million, a decrease of 36.4% compared with the same period in prior year.\n  * Net Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $66.7 million, an increase of 27% compared with the same period in prior year.\n  * Net Cash Used in Operating Activities was $28.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $44.9 million for the same period in prior year.\n\n\n\nOur summary results are as follows:\n\n**_(Unaudited)_**| **3Q 2023**| **4Q 2023**| **1Q 2024**| **2Q 2024**| **3Q 2024**| **TTM 3Q2024**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPaid Subscribers (in thousands)| 774| 737| 683| 645| 592| 592  \nTotal net revenue (in millions)| $| 106.2| $| 112.2| $| 109.0| $| 105.0| $| 97.2| $| 423.4  \nNew \"Marketing\" Billings (1)| $| 73.7| $| 67.7| $| 54.8| $| 38.7| $| 32.3| $| 193.5  \nNet \"Renewal\" Billings (2)| $| 20.8| $| 21.6| $| 21.4| $| 17.1| $| 15.7| $| 75.9  \nOther Billings (3)| $| 1.0| $| 4.2| $| 1.0| $| 1.8| $| 0.9| $| 7.9  \nTotal Billings| $| 95.5| $| 93.6| $| 77.2| $| 57.6| $| 48.9| $| 277.3  \nARPU| $| 496| $| 503| $| 492| $| 456| $| 417| $| 417  \nNet income (in millions)| $| 12.0| $| 1.9| $| 22.7| $| 21.2| $| 22.7| $| 68.6  \nCFFO (in millions)| $| 12.1| $| 15.7| $| (18.5| )| $| (3.8| )| $| (5.8| )| $| (12.4| )  \nAdjusted CFFO (in millions)| $| 12.1| $| 19.7| $| (18.5| )| $| (3.8| )| $| (5.8| )| $| (8.4| )  \n**(1)** Includes billings from all new subscription sales to new and existing subscribers.  \n**(2)** Includes billings attributable to renewal and maintenance fee payments.

The majority of the decline in cash related to activity that occurred in the first half of this year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income earned totaled $4.8 million.\n\nConsistent with previous disclosure, the Company began making required tax distribution payments in the third quarter of 2024. Tax distributions of approximately $6 million were made during the quarter and are reflected in our statement of cash flows as cash used in financing activities. We will continue to make required quarterly tax distributions in future periods, which we expect to be significant. The amount of future tax distributions however, will be dependent on a variety of factors.\n\nThe Company’s $150 million credit facility matured on October 29, 2024, with no amounts outstanding. While the Company currently has no immediate needs for external capital, and the business plan is fully funded, the Company may in the future consider entering into a new credit facility to enhance optionality around capital allocation alternatives.\n\nMarketWise Inc.’s Class A common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “MKTW.” As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 39,381,380 Class A common shares and 279,890,147 Class B common shares issued and outstanding.\n\n**About MarketWise**\n\nFounded with a mission to level the playing field for self-directed investors, today MarketWise is a leading multi-brand subscription services platform providing premium financial research, software, education, and tools for investors.\n\nWith more than 25 years of operating history, MarketWise serves a community of millions of free and paid subscribers.

MarketWise has a proven, agile, and scalable platform and our vision is to become the leading financial solutions platform for self-directed investors.\n\n**Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn this release we discuss certain key business metrics, which we believe provide useful information about the Company’s business and the operational factors underlying the Company’s financial performance. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating these key metrics, which may hinder comparability with other companies who may calculate similarly titled metrics in a different way.\n\n_Billings_ is defined as amounts invoiced to customers.\n\n_Free Subscribers_ are defined as unique subscribers who have subscribed to one of our free investment publications via a valid email address and continue to remain directly opted in, excluding any Paid Subscribers who also have free subscriptions. Active Free Subscribers are those Free Subscribers with whom we have engaged during the most recent quarter and represent those individuals who have received and/or consumed our content on a regular basis during that same quarter.\n\n_Paid Subscribers_ are defined as the total number of unique subscribers with at least one paid subscription at the end of the period.\n\n_Average revenue per user_ or _ARPU_ is defined as the trailing four quarters of net Billings divided by the average number of quarterly total Paid Subscribers over that period.\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the below non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our ability to generate cash. We use the below non-GAAP financial measures, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided above for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n_Adjusted CFFO_ is defined as cash flow from operations plus or minus any non-recurring items.\n\n_Adjusted CFFO Margin_ is defined as Adjusted CFFO as a percentage of Billings.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted CFFO and Adjusted CFFO Margin are useful indicators that provide information to management and investors about our ability to generate cash (without the effects of non-recurring items), and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\n\nWe expect Adjusted CFFO and Adjusted CFFO Margin to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to execute our growth strategy. These activities, along with any non-recurring items as described above, may result in fluctuations in Adjusted CFFO and Adjusted CFFO Margin in future periods.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted CFFO, and net cash provided by operating activities margin as a percentage of total net revenue to Adjusted CFFO Margin, in each case, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”):\n\n**_(In thousands)_**| **Third Quarter**| **Year to Date September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| ** _% Change_**| **2024**| **2023**| ** _% Change_**  \nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities| $| (5,829| )| $| 12,055|  _(148.4_ _)%_|  $| (28,135| )| $| 44,901|  _(162.7_ _)%_  \nNon-recurring expenses| —| —|  _NM_|  —| —|  _NM_  \nAdjusted CFFO| $| (5,829| )| $| 12,055|  _(148.4_ _)%_|  $| (28,135| )| $| 44,901|  _(162.7_ _)%_  \nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities| $| (5,829| )| $| 12,055|  _(148.4_ _)%_|  $| (28,135| )| $| 44,901|  _(162.7_ _)%_  \nTotal net revenue| 97,186| 106,150|  _(8.4_ _)%_|  311,223| 336,027|  _(7.4_ _)%_  \nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities margin| (6.0| %)| 11.4| %| (9.0| %)| 13.4| %  \nAdjusted CFFO| $| (5,829| )| $| 12,055|  _(148.4_ _)%_|  $| (28,135| )| $| 44,901|  _(162.7_ _)%_  \nBillings| 48,929| 95,513|  _(48.8_ _)%_|  183,728| 288,854|  _(36.4_ _)%_  \nAdjusted CFFO margin| (11.9| %)| 12.6| %| (15.3| %)| 15.5| %  \n  \nNM: Not meaningful\n\n**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, and the plans and objectives of management for future operations of MarketWise. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections, and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including, but not limited to: our ability to attract new subscribers and to persuade existing subscribers to renew their subscription agreements with us and to purchase additional products and services from us; our ability to adequately market our products and services, and to develop additional products and product offerings; our ability to manage our growth effectively, including through acquisitions; failure to maintain and protect our reputation for trustworthiness and independence; our ability to attract, develop, and retain capable management, editors, and other key personnel; our ability to grow market share in our existing markets or any new markets we may enter; adverse or weakened conditions in the financial sector, global financial markets, and global economy; current macroeconomic events, including heightened inflation, rise in interest rates and the potential for an economic recession; failure to comply with laws and regulations or other regulatory action or investigations, including the Advisers Act; our ability to respond to and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior; failure to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions, or dispose of assets and businesses; our public securities’ potential liquidity and trading; the impact of the regulatory environment and complexities with compliance related to such environment; our future capital needs; our ability to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, and to address and remediate existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; and other factors beyond our control.\n\nThe foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this press release may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\n\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and we assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We do not give any assurance that we will achieve our expectations.\n\n**_Table 1.
