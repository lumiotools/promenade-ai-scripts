Oct. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enovix Corporation (“Enovix”) (Nasdaq: ENVX), a global high-performance battery company, announced today financial results for third quarter 2024, which included the summary below from its President and CEO, Dr. Raj Talluri.\n\nFellow Shareholders,\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we made significant progress on our journey to scale. The unveiling of Fab2 was a major boost in confidence with multiple customers now indicating a desire to launch products with us starting from late 2025.\n\nOther recent highlights include:\n\n  * **Revenue growth:** Revenues were $4.3 million in the third quarter, above our guidance midpoint and up from $3.8 million in the second quarter.\n  * **Manufacturing:** The Company formally opened Fab2 in Malaysia and within weeks commenced shipping battery cells to customers.\n  * **Commercialization:** A leading smartphone OEM signed a development agreement for qualification of our battery product and mass production launch in late 2025.\n  * **Cost reduction:** We are on track to further reduce cash consumption by leveraging our new Malaysia operations which will provide runway into 2026.\n\n\n\nWe are laser-focused on execution as we see increasing demand across our target markets. The strategy we established early last year prioritized large, high-value segments, such as smartphones and AR/VR headsets, where the need for higher energy density commands a premium. This approach has proven to be visionary, with the recent surge in AI-enabled smartphones further validating our strategy and driving significant pull for our products. We are confident that our go-to-market strategy positions Enovix on an expedient path to profitability while maintaining a competitive edge in innovation.\n\nOur analysis of recent smartphone launches highlights a critical shortfall in conventional batteries. Energy density improvements in flagship devices released in 2024 have stagnated, with a mere 1% year-over-year increase. We believe this trajectory is insufficient to meet escalating demands of modern devices, especially those powered by AI.\n\nIn contrast, our battery technology roadmap offers a generational leap in energy density. With our Malaysia Fab now gearing up for production, we are in a full sprint to commercialize this transformative technology and meet the pressing needs of the industry. Our focus on rapid execution will enable us to offer substantial benefits to our customers and consumers alike, positioning us as a leader in next-generation battery solutions.\n\n**Business Update**\n\n**Manufacturing.** We formally opened Fab2 in Malaysia with various stakeholders including several leading smartphone OEMs that provided decidedly positive feedback on ramp quality and speed, as well as the level of automation. A total of 11 customers have now inspected our new facility. The Agility Line is fully operational with initial yields comparable to final levels we achieved with our first manufacturing line in California, with expected improvements on the horizon. Consistent with our plans, we commenced shipping EX-1M cells to customers in the third quarter, supporting their qualification and mass production timelines. We are on track to complete Site Acceptance Testing (SAT) of the High-Volume Line in Q4 2024.\n\n**Commercialization.** Our business team has made significant progress toward profitability by securing demand across multiple high-growth markets. We are excited to announce that we have formalized a strategic partnership with a second leading smartphone OEM. This agreement outlines key milestones, and upon meeting them, we are poised to enter the smartphone market in late 2025 with high-volume production from our Fab2 facility. This marks a major step forward in our journey to scale.\n\nIn parallel, we have aligned on a production schedule with a leading IoT customer, which includes a mass production purchase order also slated for 2025. This partnership underscores our ability to diversify into high-value sectors beyond smartphones. Further, we are aggressively expanding our pipeline by engaging with strategic IoT customers to unlock high-growth opportunities and accelerate top-of-the-funnel momentum.\n\nIn the EV space, we are advancing our targeted strategy of developing customized products with two of the world’s largest automotive OEMs. In Q4, we expect to complete our first milestone pursuant to the agreement with one of the major automakers in the EV market, which is a major milestone in our efforts to enter and grow within the EV market. Looking ahead, we are focused on expanding these relationships in 2025, leveraging a capital-efficient, licensing-based business model in the EV space that aligns with the long-term scalability of our technology.\n\n**Products:** Our product development team is advancing toward the 2025 mass production of EX-1M, which will highlight the capabilities of our breakthrough active silicon technology. In Q3, we successfully achieved UN38.3 certification, marking a critical milestone for market entry and a strong validation of our products' safety.\n\nIn addition, we are on track to sample EX-2M to select customers in Q4. We’re now making samples and have identified the product’s advanced electrochemistry. These early samples will be instrumental in accelerating the timeline to full-scale production. Finally, we have made progress on the comprehensive product definition of EX-3M, reaffirming our commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation and delivering industry-leading solutions to customers across a range of industries.\n\n**Financials:** Revenue was $4.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, near the high end of our guidance range and up from $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nOur GAAP cost of revenue was $5.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 representing a slight reduction sequentially as a percentage of sales and leading to a similar gross income level.\n\nOur GAAP operating expenses of $48.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 were down from $88.1 million in the second quarter, due largely to lower restructuring costs which were concentrated in the previous quarter as the Company shifted our manufacturing operations from the U.S. to Malaysia. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $27.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 12% from $30.9 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nOur GAAP net loss attributable to Enovix of $22.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 was down from $115.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 due to lower restructuring costs. Our GAAP net loss attributable to Enovix for the third quarter of 2024 also included $29.9 million of income due to a decrease in the fair value of our common stock warrants during the quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 was a loss of $21.6 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $23.1 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nEarnings per share loss in the third quarter of 2024 was $0.30 on a GAAP basis and $0.17 on a non-GAAP basis compared to second quarter earnings per share loss of $0.67 on a GAAP basis and $0.14 on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nWe exited the third quarter of 2024 with $200.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments due to cash used in operating activities of $30.7 million and capital expenditures of $19.5 million during the quarter.\n\nA full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is available later in this report.\n\n**_Outlook_**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue between $8.0 million and $10.0 million, a GAAP EPS loss of $0.23 to $0.29, an adjusted EBITDA loss of $19.0 million to $25.0 million, and a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.15 to $0.21.\n\n**_Summary_**\n\nWe are very pleased with our accomplishments in the third quarter. Fab2 is now operational and shipping samples to customers. We secured a 2025 launch commitment from a major smartphone OEM. And we made progress on our product roadmap for EX-2M and beyond. For the remaining months of 2024, the key objectives are completing SAT for the High-Volume Line and shipping EX-2M samples.\n\n**_Conference Call Information_**\n\nEnovix will hold a video conference call at 2:00 PM PT / 5:00 PM ET today, October 29, 2024, to discuss the company’s business updates and financial results.

Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they exclude certain expenses that are required under GAAP, which adjustments reflect the exercise of judgment by management. Reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the tables at the end of this shareholder letter.\n\nWhile Enovix provides fourth quarter 2024 guidance for adjusted EBITDA loss and non-GAAP EPS loss, we are unable to provide without unreasonable effort a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these projected non-GAAP measures. Such qualitative reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty in accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjustments that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, including but not limited to warrant liabilities and stock-based compensation. For the same reasons, we are unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis letter to shareholders contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we also utilize and present certain financial measures that are not based on GAAP. We refer to these financial measures as “non-GAAP” financial measures. In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures in evaluating its financial and operational performance distinct and apart from financing costs, certain non-cash expenses and non-operational expenses.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nWe use non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning, budgeting and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors in assessing its operating performance and comparing its performance with competitors and other comparable companies. You should review the reconciliations below but not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\n“EBITDA” is defined as earnings (net loss) attributable to Enovix adjusted for interest expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization expense. “Adjusted EBITDA” includes additional adjustments to EBITDA such as stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of common stock warrants, inventory step-up, impairment of equipment and other special items as determined by management which it does not believe to be indicative of its underlying business trends.\n\nBelow is a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Enovix on a GAAP basis to the non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA financial measures for the periods presented below (in thousands):\n\n**Quarters Ended**| **Fiscal Years-to-Date Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 29, 2024**| **October 1, 2023**| **September 29, 2024**| **October 1, 2023**  \nNet loss attributable to Enovix| $| (22,536| )| $| (16,185| )| $| (184,776| )| $| (154,094| )  \nInterest expense| 1,718| 1,557| 5,068| 2,827  \nIncome tax expense (benefit)| 2,194| —| (2,544| )| —  \nDepreciation and amortization| 6,500| 2,900| 37,417| 10,000  \nEBITDA| (12,124| )| (11,728| )| (144,835| )| (141,267| )  \nStock-based compensation expense (1)| 16,722| 13,274| 47,414| 57,473  \nChange in fair value of common stock warrants| (29,899| )| (31,320| )| (17,359| )| (4,140| )  \nInventory step-up| —| —| 1,907| —  \nImpairment of equipment| —| —| —| 4,411  \nRestructuring cost (1)| 3,661| 3,021| 41,807| 3,021  \nAcquisition cost| —| 1,115| —| 1,115  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (21,640| )| $| (25,638| )| $| (71,066| )| $| (79,387| )  \n(1) $0.1 million and $1.2 million of stock-based compensation expense are included in the restructuring cost line of the table above for the quarter and fiscal year-to-date ended September 29, 2024, respectively. $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense is included in the restructuring cost line of the table above for the quarter and fiscal year-to-date ended October 1, 2023.  \n  \n**Free Cash Flow Reconciliation**\n\nWe define “Free Cash Flow” as (i) net cash from operating activities less (ii) capital expenditures, net of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment, all of which are derived from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. The presentation of non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flows from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that this financial measure is useful to investors because it provides investors to view our performance using the same tool that we use to gauge our progress in achieving our goals and it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives. Below is a reconciliation of net cash used in operating activities to the Free Cash Flow financial measures for the periods presented below (in thousands):\n\n**Fiscal Years-to-Date Ended**  \n---

of Dr. Hongwei Yan as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), reporting directly to CEO Dr. Raj Talluri. In this role, Dr. Yan will work in concert with the CEO and the leadership team to drive technology development, customer qualification and the 2025 scale up of the company’s Malaysia high-volume manufacturing plant.\n\n“This hire is a big win for us,” said T.J. Rodgers, Enovix Chairman. “We all know that Korea and China lead the world in lithium-ion batteries. Now, we have a top scientist who has worked at both Korea’s No. 1 battery company, Samsung SDI, and China’s No. 1 battery company, Amperex Technology Limited (ATL) where he led over 30 battery qualifications with a 100% success rate for a Tier 1 US mobile customer. He brings us deep technical relationships with the battery experts at our top customers, an in-depth understanding of their qualification processes, and a successful track record in working with them to scale their production.”\n\nEnovix CEO Dr. Raj Talluri added, “I personally run our commercialization effort, and I’m thrilled to welcome Hongwei, an experienced technical expert, to my staff. Hongwei’s extensive technical background in lithium-ion battery technology – demonstrated by his 8 patents and 21 peer-reviewed publications, and hands-on Tier 1 qualification experience at smartphone OEMs – will greatly strengthen our commercialization effort.”\n\nDr. Yan said, “I am excited to join Enovix and contribute to the company’s mission. Based on my experience at ATL and Samsung, I know there is significant demand among Tier 1 smartphone OEMs for a high energy density battery that meets cycle life and charge time requirements. Enovix’s innovative architecture is the only one to enable 100% active silicon anode technology, making it an ideal solution for this market. My interactions with the Enovix team show it has the capabilities to drive successful qualification and manufacturing to scale. I look forward to being part of this team.”\n\n**About Enovix**\n\nEnovix is on a mission to deliver high-performance batteries that unlock the full potential of technology products.
