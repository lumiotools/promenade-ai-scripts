Sustainability Ratings\n\nNovember 25, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/23896/pdf)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Silicon Labs, a leader in secure, intelligent wireless technology, today announced that they scored in the top 1 percent of companies in EcoVadis's [Environment, Sustainability, and Governance](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4311279-1&h=3407316996&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.silabs.com%2Fabout-us%2Fenvironmental-social-governance&a=Environment%2C+Sustainability%2C+and+Governance) (ESG) ratings with an overall score of 83 out of 100.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Silicon Labs\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/457128/silicon_labs_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/457128/silicon_labs_Logo.html)\n\n\"EcoVadis is a widely recognized assessor of business and supply chain sustainability and governance best practices,\" said Dean Butler, Chief Financial Officer at Silicon Labs. \"By scoring in the 99th percentile, Silicon Labs demonstrates to our customers, partners, and communities that we are dedicated to operating with transparent business practices in all that we do.\"\n\nTrajectory of Growth and Improvement\n\nSilicon Labs joined the EcoVadis program in 2021, ranking in the top 35 percent of companies. Since that time, the company has implemented new sustainability programs and data collection processes and made significant improvements in public ESG disclosures. Silicon Labs teams and sustainability consultants came together in a multiyear effort to improve those scores, and the results are acknowledged by the improved Ecovadis and other rater scores in 2024.\n\nEcoVadis measures across four categories: Environment, Labor and Human Rights, Ethics, and Sustainable Procurement. Silicon Labs improved their scores across all four categories, and the company scored highest in the Environment metric, with 90 out of 100. This score reflects and aligns with Silicon Labs' overall ESG journey, where the company has taken great strides to advance lower emissions and energy plans to reduce its overall global carbon footprint.\n\nCommitment to Transparency in Reporting\n\nSilicon Labs plans to release its annual Corporate Sustainability Report (CSR) in Spring 2025, providing continued transparency around its ESG efforts. The report will highlight both the company's overall ESG initiatives in 2024 and the role of Silicon Labs' low-energy products in enabling customers to design more sustainable, energy efficient IoT products.\n\nDownload a copy of the company's current [Corporate Sustainability Report](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4311279-1&h=1163471046&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.silabs.com%2Fdocuments%2Fpublic%2Fcorporate%2F2023-corporate-sustainability-report.pdf&a=Corporate+Sustainability+Report).\n\n**About Silicon Labs**Silicon Labs is a trailblazer in wireless connectivity for the Internet of Things. Its integrated hardware and software platform, intuitive development tools, and unmatched ecosystem support make Silicon Labs the ideal long-term partner in building advanced industrial, commercial, and home and life applications.

Version](/node/23856/pdf)\n\n_Wireless IoT leader delivers third-quarter results above the midpoint of its guidance_\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --  _Silicon Labs_ (NASDAQ: SLAB), a leader in secure, intelligent wireless technology for a more connected world, reported financial results for the third quarter, which ended September 28, 2024.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Silicon Labs\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/457128/silicon_labs_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/457128/silicon_labs_Logo.html)\n\n\"Silicon Labs delivered solid sequential revenue growth as several key design wins began ramping in the quarter,\" said Matt Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer at Silicon Labs. \"Looking ahead, progress on inventory destocking and demand recovery remains uneven across our end markets. Despite the uncertain market backdrop in the near-term, we remain well-positioned for long-term growth and market share expansion.\"\n\n**Third****Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $166 million\n  * Industrial & Commercial revenue for the quarter was $96 million, up 10% sequentially\n  * Home & Life revenue for the quarter was $70 million, up 22% sequentially\n\n\n\nResults on a GAAP basis:\n\n  * GAAP gross margin was 54.3%\n  * GAAP operating expenses were $120 million\n  * GAAP operating loss was $30 million\n  * GAAP diluted loss per share was $(0.88)\n\n\n\nResults on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of stock compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and certain other items as set forth in the below GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation tables were as follows:\n\n  * Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.5%\n  * Non-GAAP operating expenses were $99 million\n  * Non-GAAP operating loss was $8 million\n  * Non-GAAP diluted loss per share was $(0.13)\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * Silicon Labs' 5th annual IoT developers conference, _Works With_ , expanded its footprint this year with in-person events in key global regions, including Austin, San Jose, Hyderabad, and Shanghai. This signature event series unites device manufacturers, wireless experts, engineers, and industry leaders, and attracted over 500 companies – among them Amazon, Google, Samsung, and Nvidia. Notably, over 60% of attendees were new to Silicon Labs, with one-third from top strategic customer segments. Silicon Labs will further extend _Works With_ virtually on November 20 & 21, reaching thousands of potential and existing customers worldwide.\n  * Announced the general availability of its first Wi-Fi 6 solution: the SiWx917. The 917 family of SoC's is designed from the ground-up for ultra-low-power applications using Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, Matter, and IP networking for secure cloud connectivity while offering up to 2 years battery life on a single AAA battery in select IoT applications.\n  * Announced support for Bluetooth Channel Sounding technology on its current xG24 platform, significantly enhancing the accuracy, interoperability, and security of distance measurement between two Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) devices in applications like building access controls, keyless entry, and asset tracking.\n  * Announced that Silicon Labs' MG26 device for Bluetooth and 15.4 connectivity was awarded one of the IoT Evolution's Product of the Year awards. This multiprotocol wireless SoC was announced earlier this year and is built to be future proof as the needs of the IoT grow, featuring the same Matrix Vector Processor for dedicated machine learning as the upcoming Series 3.\n\n\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nThe company expects fourth-quarter revenue to be between $161 to $171 million. The company also estimates the following results:\n\nOn a GAAP basis:\n\n  * GAAP gross margin to be between 54% to 55%\n  * GAAP operating expenses of approximately $118 million to $122 million\n  * GAAP diluted loss per share per share between $(0.75) to $(1.05)\n\n\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of stock compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and certain other items as set forth in the reconciliation tables:\n\n  * Non-GAAP gross margin to be between 54% to 55%\n  * Non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $97 million to $99 million\n  * Non-GAAP diluted loss per share between $(0.01) to $(0.21)\n\n\n\n**Earnings Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nSilicon Labs will host an earnings conference call to discuss the quarterly results and answer questions at 3:30 pm CDT today. An audio webcast will be available on Silicon Labs' website ([www.silabs.com](http://www.silabs.com)) under Investor Relations. In addition, the company will post an audio recording of the event at [investor.silabs.com](http://investor.silabs.com) and make a replay available through December 4, 2024.\n\n**About Silicon Labs**\n\nSilicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB) is a leader in secure, intelligent wireless technology for a more connected world.
