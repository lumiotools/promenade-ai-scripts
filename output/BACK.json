(“IMAC” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: BACK) today announced that it received an expected deficiency notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on November 22, 2024 (the “Notice”). The Notice indicated that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”) as a result of its failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 (the “Form 10-Q”), as described more fully in the Company’s Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing (the “Form 12b-25”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 15, 2024. The Listing Rule requires Nasdaq-listed companies to timely file all required periodic reports with the SEC.\n\nThe Company continues to work diligently to file the Form 10-Q as soon as practicable.\n\nThe Notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\nThe Company has until January 21, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule (the “Plan”). Pursuant to the Notice, if Nasdaq accepts the Plan, Nasdaq has the discretion to grant the Company an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Form 10-Q, or until May 19, 2025, to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. The Company intends to take the necessary steps to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules as soon as practicable.\n\nWhile the Company can provide no assurances as to timing, the Company intends to take action to submit a plan to regain compliance within the 60 calendar day submission period, and, if Nasdaq accepts the plan to regain compliance, to subsequently regain compliance within the extended time granted by Nasdaq. While the Company is exercising diligent efforts to maintain the listing of its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance within the applicable time period. In addition, if the Company does not regain compliance within the applicable time period, Nasdaq could provide notice that the Company’s securities will become subject to delisting. If the Company receives notice that its securities are being delisted, Nasdaq rules permit the Company to appeal any delisting determination by Nasdaq staff to a hearings panel.\n\n**About IMAC Holdings, Inc.**\n\nIMAC Holdings, Inc. is headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee.

Launches Subsidiary Ignite Proteomics and Announces Groundbreaking Precision Oncology Case Study Utilizing RPPA Technology\n\nSeptember 19, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/8341/pdf)\n\nNashville, TN, Sept. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMAC Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: BACK) (“IMAC Holdings” or the “Company”), a leader in innovative healthcare solutions, proudly announces the launch of an entirely new precision oncology assay for breast cancer treatment decision making utilizing the Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) technology through its newly established subsidiary, Ignite Proteomics LLC (“Ignite Proteomics”). This launch follows IMAC Holdings’ strategic acquisition of key assets from Theralink Technologies, Inc., and is underscored by a landmark clinical case study _“_** _Proteomics based selection achieves complete response to HER2 therapy in HER2 IHC 0 breast cancer”,_** demonstrating the power of RPPA technology in precision oncology published in npj Precision Oncology, an international, peer-reviewed journal focused on precision oncology.\n\nRevolutionizing Cancer Care with Precision OncologyIgnite Proteomics introduces the only commercialy available and clinically validated assay that can measure both the expression and activated protein drug target levels in breast tumors, a superior way to measure the potential effectiveness of targeted cancer therapies. The clinical utility of the Ignite proteomic assay is highlighted by this recent case study involving a 57-year-old woman with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who exhibited an exceptional response to treatment guided by Ignite’s RPPA-based analysis.\n\nCase Study Highlights: A Breakthrough in Precision MedicineDespite previous extensive treatments including chemotherapy and targeted therapies, the patient experienced disease progression across multiple sites (brain, mediastinal lymph nodes, lungs, chest wall, liver, and skin). A clinical trial at the Inova Schar Cancer Institute (ISCI) allowed for a comparative analysis using both current next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays and Ignite’s novel assay on the same biopsy. After Ignite Proteomics RPPA assay identifed the expression and activation of an important protein called HER2, which was missed by both the NGS analysis and current approaches to measure HER2 the patient was treated with the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) , which relies on HER2 expression and activation to work. After 9 cycles no measurable disease was observed, representing a complete response to therapy.\n\n“The RPPA technology and our novel proteomics assay represent a transformative advancement in the management of breast cancer, providing critical insights that enable us to tailor treatments with greater precision and effectiveness,” said Faith Zaslavsky, CEO of IMAC Holdings and Ignite Proteomics. “The remarkable response observed in this case study underscores the role our assay can play in significantly impacting patient outcomes.”\n\nAbout IMAC Holdings, Inc.IMAC Holdings, Inc. is dedicated to advancing healthcare through innovative solutions that improve patient outcomes. With a focus on strategic acquisitions and pioneering technologies, IMAC Holdings is at the forefront of precision medicine.\n\nAbout Ignite ProteomicsIgnite Proteomics LLC, a subsidiary of IMAC Holdings, Inc., specializes in advanced RPPA technology for cancer diagnostics. As the only provider of a CLIA-accredited RPPA assay for breast cancer, Ignite Proteomics is setting new benchmarks in protein-based testing and personalized oncology care.\n\n**For additional information, please contact:** [Investors@imacholdings.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dW9EnOQ9jl1dBiowMcFM5lmHCCUj6iRgFpTwUjgDqC1mwHIAeLPsyCbkSp6mIYPNmNNLmR-kxdQI15vjn9g220NMv-oBWXlsTHYpbb0JFsK8tn8VODRZgZYcjd7TY4lG)\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTIzMzUyMyM2NDg2NjcxIzUwMDA1MTI5Ng==)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZTQwZWRjMTAtZjQyNC00NmI5LWE3NDktYWQ3YjM2MDIyNzAyLTUwMDA1MTI5Ng==/tiny/IMAC-Holdings-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/d9d470ab-37da-4264-8b8d-58130636968b/small/logo-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d9d470ab-37da-4264-8b8d-58130636968b)\n\nSource: IMAC Holdings, Inc.\n\n[](#)\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://imacregeneration.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/imac-holdings-inc-launches-subsidiary-ignite-proteomics-and&t=IMAC Holdings, Inc. - IMAC Holdings Inc.
