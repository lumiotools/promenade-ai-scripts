(“Bitcoin Depot” or the “Company”), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator and leading fintech company, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Bitcoin Depot will host a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET today. An earnings presentation and link to the webcast will be made available at [ir.bitcoindepot.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EbRig5EnsAfflYexZ4TzGzL1e0x8LXWmr_-O1jWhnp0En040--xMVOnKJE4Fecw4wSjFk-oRO7Qz--AhMpXg4ky9mQ7sHSaVg-Y4DNd4800= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n“During the third quarter, we made significant strides in expanding our Bitcoin ATM network while working to optimize existing machines for greater profitability,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot. “We ended the quarter with 8,300 machines, surpassing our goals and reflecting our team's execution and vision to enhance Bitcoin’s accessibility.\n\n“In the past year, we’ve focused on relocating underperforming BTMs to more promising locations, a strategy that historically boosts average profitability per kiosk over time. While this improvement may not be fully visible in our consolidated quarterly numbers, the strategy is proving effective. With our extensive kiosk footprint and these initiatives in place, we are confident in our ability to drive shareholder value moving forward.\n\n“As a result of our continued cash flow generation, we believe that beginning a cash dividend to common shareholders in 2025 will be one of the ways we create value for shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $135.3 million, down 25% from $179.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decline was largely driven by the impact of unfavorable legislation that was passed in California that went into effect in January 2024, along with the Company’s continued process of relocating underperforming kiosks in order to optimize fleet profitability.\n\nTotal operating expenses declined 13% to $16.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to costs of going public in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 116% to $2.3 million, compared to net income of $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to lower operating expenses in 2024, and expenses associated with the PIPE financing in the third quarter of 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 was $22.4 million, down 17% from $26.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross profit margin, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 increased approximately 160 basis points to 16.6% compared to 15.0% in the third quarter of 2023. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 34% to $9.2 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decline was due to the lower revenue. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $32.2 million as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. The Company generated $5.8 million in cash flows from operations in the third quarter and $17.3 million for the first nine months of 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company generated $5.8 million of cash flow from operations compared to $7.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nBitcoin Depot will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time) today to discuss its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nCall Date: Wednesday, November 13, 2024 Time: 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time) U.S. dial-in: 646-968-2525International dial-in: 888-596-4144Conference ID: 7631242\n\nThe conference call will broadcast live and be available for replay [**here**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R-HVzeT6XLjd-kqv5f_Whd-4Z20z47F3NkMhAGzG2PoKWqQOZo0Tjw9NOPvOXpCedushXujNq98i6Bop46NV9CLcTBuRAqATYQ4iohHshRY= \"Opens in a new window\") following the call.\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number approximately 10 minutes before the start time.

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the expectations of plans, business strategies, objectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance, including our growth strategy and ability to increase deployment of our products and services, our ability to strengthen our financial profile, and worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current beliefs, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as “anticipate,” “appears,” “approximately,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “designed,” “effect,” “estimate,” “evaluate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “initiative,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,“ ”plan,“ ”potential,“ ”priorities,“ ”project,“ ”pursue,“ ”seek,“ ”should,“ ”target,“ ”when,“ ”will,“ ”would,” or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. In making these statements, we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond our control.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination; risks relating to the uncertainty of our projected financial information; future global, regional or local economic and market conditions; the development, effects and enforcement of laws and regulations; our ability to manage future growth; our ability to develop new products and services, bring them to market in a timely manner and make enhancements to our platform; the effects of competition on our future business; our ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities; the outcome of any potential litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries; and those factors described or referenced in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect our expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our assessments to change.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or other factors that affect the subject of these statements, except where we are expressly required to do so by law. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\n\n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **December 31, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 32,229 | $ | 29,759  \nCryptocurrencies | 1,311 | 712  \nAccounts receivable | 380 | 245  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 7,453 | 6,554  \nTotal current assets | 41,373 | 37,270  \nProperty and equipment:  \nFurniture and fixtures | 635 | 635  \nLeasehold improvements | 172 | 172  \nKiosk machines - owned | 32,086 | 24,222  \nKiosk machines - leased | 20,004 | 20,524  \nTotal property and equipment | 52,897 | 45,553  \nLess: accumulated depreciation | (25,350 | ) | (20,699 | )  \nTotal property and equipment, net | 27,547 | 24,854  \nIntangible assets, net | 2,698 | 3,836  \nGoodwill | 8,717 | 8,717  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net | 2,814 | 484  \nDeposits | 736 | 412  \nDeferred tax assets | 3,562 | 1,804  \n**Total assets** | $ | 87,447 | $ | 77,377  \n  \n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **December 31, 2023**  \n**Liabilities and Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity**  \nCurrent:  \nAccounts payable | $ | 11,965 | $ | 8,337  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities | 20,196 | 21,545  \nNotes payable, current portion | 4,860 | 3,985  \nIncome taxes payable | 1,355 | 2,484  \nDeferred revenue | 201 | 297  \nOperating lease liabilities, current portion | 887 | 279  \nCurrent installments of obligations under finance leases | 3,931 | 6,801  \nOther non-income tax payable | 2,236 | 2,297  \nTotal current liabilities | 45,631 | 46,025  \nLong-term liabilities  \nNotes payable, non-current | 41,864 | 17,101  \nOperating lease liabilities, non-current | 1,983 | 319  \nObligations under finance leases, non-current | 2,856 | 2,848  \nDeferred income tax, net | 852 | 846  \nTax receivable agreement liability due to related party, non-current | 2,126 | 865  \n**Total Liabilities** | 95,312 | 68,004  \n**Commitments and Contingencies (Note 19)**  \n**Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity**  \nSeries A Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value;

This press release includes both historical and projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and certain ratios and other metrics derived therefrom such as Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Gross Profit margin, which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBitcoin Depot defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses, share-based compensation, expenses related to the PIPE financing and miscellaneous cost adjustments. Such items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. In addition, Bitcoin Depot defines Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and depreciation and amortization adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. Bitcoin Depot believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit each provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Bitcoin Depot’s results of operations, as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Bitcoin Depot’s business performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are each key measurements used internally by management to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial planning. However, you should be aware that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Bitcoin Depot’s financial results, and further, that Bitcoin Depot may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Bitcoin Depot primarily relies on GAAP results and uses both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Neither Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Gross Profit should be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP and may not be indicative of Bitcoin Depot’s historical or future operating results. Bitcoin Depot’s computation of both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate such measures in the same fashion. As such, undue reliance should not be placed on such measures.\n\nDue to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from the projections of Adjusted EBITDA, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, Bitcoin Depot is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: \n\n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** RECONCILIATION OF NET (LOSS) INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA(UNAUDITED)  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**_(in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet (loss) income | $ | 2,299 | $ | 1,065 | $ | 2,421 | $ | 3,143  \nAdjustments:  \nInterest expense | 2,907 | 2,769 | 10,731 | 10,120  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) | 347 | 337 | 479 | (977 | )  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,245 | 3,260 | 8,184 | 9,554  \nExpense related to the PIPE transaction (1) | — | 2,700 | — | 12,281  \nNon-recurring expenses (2) | 297 | 2,873 | 1,204 | 7,664  \nShare-based compensation | 412 | 944 | 3,037 | 1,326  \nSpecial bonus (3) | 675 | — | 675 | 3,915  \nExpenses associated with the termination of the phantom equity participation plan | — | — | — | 350  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 9,182 | $ | 13,948 | $ | 26,731 | $ | 47,376  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin (4) | 6.8 | % | 7.8 | % | 6.1 | % | 8.8 | %  \n  \n(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, amount includes the recognition of a non-cash expense of $2.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, related to the PIPE transaction.

(“Bitcoin Depot” or the “Company”), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator and leading fintech company, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Bitcoin Depot will host a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET today. An earnings presentation and link to the webcast will be made available at [ir.bitcoindepot.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EbRig5EnsAfflYexZ4TzGzL1e0x8LXWmr_-O1jWhnp0En040--xMVOnKJE4Fecw4wSjFk-oRO7Qz--AhMpXg4ky9mQ7sHSaVg-Y4DNd4800= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n“During the third quarter, we made significant strides in expanding our Bitcoin ATM network while working to optimize existing machines for greater profitability,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot. “We ended the quarter with 8,300 machines, surpassing our goals and reflecting our team's execution and vision to enhance Bitcoin’s accessibility.\n\n“In the past year, we’ve focused on relocating underperforming BTMs to more promising locations, a strategy that historically boosts average profitability per kiosk over time. While this improvement may not be fully visible in our consolidated quarterly numbers, the strategy is proving effective. With our extensive kiosk footprint and these initiatives in place, we are confident in our ability to drive shareholder value moving forward.\n\n“As a result of our continued cash flow generation, we believe that beginning a cash dividend to common shareholders in 2025 will be one of the ways we create value for shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $135.3 million, down 25% from $179.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decline was largely driven by the impact of unfavorable legislation that was passed in California that went into effect in January 2024, along with the Company’s continued process of relocating underperforming kiosks in order to optimize fleet profitability.\n\nTotal operating expenses declined 13% to $16.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to costs of going public in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 116% to $2.3 million, compared to net income of $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to lower operating expenses in 2024, and expenses associated with the PIPE financing in the third quarter of 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 was $22.4 million, down 17% from $26.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross profit margin, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 increased approximately 160 basis points to 16.6% compared to 15.0% in the third quarter of 2023. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 34% to $9.2 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decline was due to the lower revenue. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $32.2 million as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. The Company generated $5.8 million in cash flows from operations in the third quarter and $17.3 million for the first nine months of 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company generated $5.8 million of cash flow from operations compared to $7.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nBitcoin Depot will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time) today to discuss its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nCall Date: Wednesday, November 13, 2024 Time: 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time) U.S. dial-in: 646-968-2525International dial-in: 888-596-4144Conference ID: 7631242\n\nThe conference call will broadcast live and be available for replay [**here**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R-HVzeT6XLjd-kqv5f_Whd-4Z20z47F3NkMhAGzG2PoKWqQOZo0Tjw9NOPvOXpCedushXujNq98i6Bop46NV9CLcTBuRAqATYQ4iohHshRY= \"Opens in a new window\") following the call.\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number approximately 10 minutes before the start time.

Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the expectations of plans, business strategies, objectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance, including our growth strategy and ability to increase deployment of our products and services, our ability to strengthen our financial profile, and worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current beliefs, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as “anticipate,” “appears,” “approximately,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “designed,” “effect,” “estimate,” “evaluate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “initiative,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,“ ”plan,“ ”potential,“ ”priorities,“ ”project,“ ”pursue,“ ”seek,“ ”should,“ ”target,“ ”when,“ ”will,“ ”would,” or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. In making these statements, we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events or financial results. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond our control.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination; risks relating to the uncertainty of our projected financial information; future global, regional or local economic and market conditions; the development, effects and enforcement of laws and regulations; our ability to manage future growth; our ability to develop new products and services, bring them to market in a timely manner and make enhancements to our platform; the effects of competition on our future business; our ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities; the outcome of any potential litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries; and those factors described or referenced in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect our expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our assessments to change.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or other factors that affect the subject of these statements, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.

This press release includes both historical and projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and certain ratios and other metrics derived therefrom such as Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Gross Profit margin, which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBitcoin Depot defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses, share-based compensation, expenses related to the PIPE financing and miscellaneous cost adjustments. Such items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. In addition, Bitcoin Depot defines Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and depreciation and amortization adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. Bitcoin Depot believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit each provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Bitcoin Depot’s results of operations, as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Bitcoin Depot’s business performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are each key measurements used internally by management to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial planning. However, you should be aware that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Bitcoin Depot’s financial results, and further, that Bitcoin Depot may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Bitcoin Depot primarily relies on GAAP results and uses both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Neither Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Gross Profit should be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP and may not be indicative of Bitcoin Depot’s historical or future operating results. Bitcoin Depot’s computation of both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate such measures in the same fashion. As such, undue reliance should not be placed on such measures.\n\nDue to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from the projections of Adjusted EBITDA, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, Bitcoin Depot is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: \n\n**BITCOIN DEPOT INC.** RECONCILIATION OF NET (LOSS) INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA(UNAUDITED)  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**_(in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet (loss) income | $ | 2,299 | $ | 1,065 | $ | 2,421 | $ | 3,143  \nAdjustments:  \nInterest expense | 2,907 | 2,769 | 10,731 | 10,120  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) | 347 | 337 | 479 | (977 | )  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,245 | 3,260 | 8,184 | 9,554  \nExpense related to the PIPE transaction (1) | — | 2,700 | — | 12,281  \nNon-recurring expenses (2) | 297 | 2,873 | 1,204 | 7,664  \nShare-based compensation | 412 | 944 | 3,037 | 1,326  \nSpecial bonus (3) | 675 | — | 675 | 3,915  \nExpenses associated with the termination of the phantom equity participation plan | — | — | — | 350  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 9,182 | $ | 13,948 | $ | 26,731 | $ | 47,376  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin (4) | 6.8 | % | 7.8 | % | 6.1 | % | 8.8 | %  \n  \n(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, amount includes the recognition of a non-cash expense of $2.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, related to the PIPE transaction.

(“Bitcoin Depot” or the\n“Company”), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator and leading fintech company, today\nreported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Bitcoin Depot will\nhost a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET today. An earnings presentation and\nlink to the webcast will be made available at ir.bitcoindepot.com.\n“During the third quarter, we made significant strides in expanding our Bitcoin ATM network\nwhile working to optimize existing machines for greater profitability,” said Brandon Mintz,\nCEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot. “We ended the quarter with 8,300 machines, surpassing\nour goals and reflecting our team's execution and vision to enhance Bitcoin’s accessibility.\n“In the past year, we’ve focused on relocating underperforming BTMs to more promising\nlocations, a strategy that historically boosts average profitability per kiosk over time. While\nthis improvement may not be fully visible in our consolidated quarterly numbers, the strategy\nis proving effective. With our extensive kiosk footprint and these initiatives in place, we are\nconfident in our ability to drive shareholder value moving forward.\n“As a result of our continued cash flow generation, we believe that beginning a cash dividend\nto common shareholders in 2025 will be one of the ways we create value for shareholders.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $135.3 million, down 25% from $179.5 million in\nthe third quarter of 2023. This decline was largely driven by the impact of unfavorable\nlegislation that was passed in California that went into effect in January 2024, along with the\nCompany’s continued process of relocating underperforming kiosks in order to optimize fleet\nprofitability.\nTotal operating expenses declined 13% to $16.9 million for the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared to $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to costs of going public in 2023\nthat did not recur in 2024.\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 116% to $2.3 million, compared to net\nincome of $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to lower operating\nexpenses in 2024, and expenses associated with the PIPE financing in the third quarter of\n2023 that did not recur in 2024.\nAdjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 was $22.4 million,\ndown 17% from $26.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross profit margin, a\nnon-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 increased approximately 160 basis points to\n16.6% compared to 15.0% in the third quarter of 2023. Please see “Explanation and\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 34% to $9.2\nmillion, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The\ndecline was due to the lower revenue. Please see “Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-\nGAAP Financial Measures” below.\nCash and cash equivalents were $32.2 million as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. The\nCompany generated $5.8 million in cash flows from operations in the third quarter and $17.3\nmillion for the first nine months of 2024.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company generated $5.8 million of cash flow from\noperations compared to $7.0 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nConference Call\nBitcoin Depot will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time)\ntoday to discuss its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nCall Date: Wednesday, November 13, 2024\nTime: 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time)\nU.S. dial-in: 646-968-2525\nInternational dial-in: 888-596-4144\nConference ID: 7631242\nThe conference call will broadcast live and be available for replay here following the call.\nPlease call the conference telephone number approximately 10 minutes before the start\ntime.

This press release includes both\nhistorical and projected Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, and certain ratios and\nother metrics derived therefrom such as Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Gross Profit\nmargin, which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nBitcoin Depot defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax\nexpense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses, share-based\ncompensation, expenses related to the PIPE financing and miscellaneous cost adjustments.\nSuch items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in\nnature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core\nresults of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less\nmeaningful. In addition, Bitcoin Depot defines Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and\ndepreciation and amortization adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. Bitcoin\nDepot believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit each provide useful information\nto investors and others in understanding and evaluating Bitcoin Depot’s results of\noperations, as well as provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Bitcoin\nDepot’s business performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are each key\nmeasurements used internally by management to make operating decisions, including those\nrelated to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial\nplanning. However, you should be aware that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit\nare not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP and may\nexclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing Bitcoin Depot’s financial\nresults, and further, that Bitcoin Depot may incur future expenses similar to those excluded\nwhen calculating these measures. Bitcoin Depot primarily relies on GAAP results and uses\nboth Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Neither Adjusted\nEBITDA or Adjusted Gross Profit should be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative\nto, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or\nperformance under GAAP and may not be indicative of Bitcoin Depot’s historical or future\noperating results. Bitcoin Depot’s computation of both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross\nProfit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other\ncompanies because not all companies calculate such measures in the same fashion. As\nsuch, undue reliance should not be placed on such measures.\nDue to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some\nof the information excluded from the projections of Adjusted EBITDA, together with some of\nthe excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, Bitcoin Depot is unable to\nquantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no\ndisclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included and no reconciliation of the\nforward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the\nperiods indicated:\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NET (LOSS) INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA\n(UNAUDITED)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income $ 2,299 $ 1,065 $ 2,421 $ 3,143\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense 2,907 2,769 10,731 10,120\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 347 337 479 (977)\nDepreciation and amortization 2,245 3,260 8,184 9,554\nExpense related to the PIPE\ntransaction (1) — 2,700 — 12,281\nNon-recurring expenses (2) 297 2,873 1,204 7,664\nShare-based compensation\n412 944 3,037 1,326\nSpecial bonus (3) 675 — 675 3,915\nExpenses associated with the\ntermination of the phantom equity\nparticipation plan — — — 350\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 9,182 $ 13,948 $ 26,731 $ 47,376\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (4) 6.8% 7.8% 6.1% 8.8%\n(1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, amount includes the\nrecognition of a non-cash expense of $2.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, related to\nthe PIPE transaction.\n(2) Comprised of non-recurring professional service fees.\n(3) For nine months ended September 30, 2023, amount includes (A) Transaction bonus\nand related taxes to employees of approximately $2.3 million and (B) Founder Transaction\nbonus of approximately $1.6 million.

Pursuant to a transaction with GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. (“GSRM”),\na Delaware corporation formed on October 14, 2021, Legacy Bitcoin Depot merged with and into GSRM and GSRM was renamed Bitcoin Depot Inc. (“Bitcoin Depot”, or\nthe “Company”) (see Note 2(a)). Bitcoin Depot owns and operates a network of cryptocurrency kiosks (“BTMs”) across North America, Puerto Rico, and Australia where\ncustomers can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. In addition to the BTM network, Bitcoin Depot also sells cryptocurrency to consumers at a network of retail locations through its\nBDCheckout product offering and through its website. The BDCheckout offering allows users similar functionality to the BTM kiosks, enabling users to load cash into their\naccounts at the checkout counter at retail locations, and use those funds to purchase cryptocurrency. The Company’s website allows users to purchase cryptocurrency online\nfor which the Company earns a commission. Bitcoin Depot also offers a software solution to other BTM operators through its controlled subsidiary, BitAccess Inc.\n(\"BitAccess\").\n(b) Background\nSeveral factors affect the price of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to: (a) global supply and demand; (b) investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;\n(c) interest rates; (d) currency exchange rates, including the rates at which cryptocurrencies may be exchanged for fiat currencies; (e) fiat currency withdrawal and deposit\npolicies of electronic market places where traders may buy and sell cryptocurrencies based on bid-ask trading activity with the various exchanges and the liquidity of those\nexchanges; (f) interruptions in service from or failures of major cryptocurrency exchanges; (g) investment and trading activities of large investors, including private and\nregistered funds, that may directly or indirectly invest in cryptocurrencies; (h) monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations; (i)\nregulatory measures, if any, that restrict the use of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment; (j) the maintenance and development of the open-source protocol governing the\ncryptocurrency’s network; (k) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; (l) expectations among market participants that the value of a\ncryptocurrency will soon change; and (m) the reduction in mining rewards of Bitcoin, including block reward halving events, which are events that occur after a specific\nperiod of time and reduce the block reward earned by miners.\nGlobal supply for a particular cryptocurrency is determined by the asset’s network source code, which sets the rate at which assets may be awarded to network participants.\nGlobal demand for cryptocurrencies is influenced by such factors as the increase in acceptance by retail merchants and commercial businesses of a cryptocurrency as a\npayment alternative, the security of online exchanges and digital wallets, the perception that the use of cryptocurrencies is safe and secure, and the lack of regulatory\nrestrictions on their use. Additionally, there is no assurance that any cryptocurrency will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power. Any of these events could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and the results of its operations.\n(c) Liquidity\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had current assets of $41.4 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $32.2 million, current liabilities of $45.6 million, total\nstockholders’ (deficit) of $(7.9) million and an accumulated deficit of $37.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized net income of\n$2.4 million, generated positive cash flows from operations of $17.3 million and had cash flows used in financing activities of $4.3 million, primarily due to the issuance of\nnotes payable, distributions and payments on finance leases. The Company expects its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operations, to be\nsufficient to fund its operations for a period of 12 months from the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued.\n(d) Risks and Uncertainties\nThe operations of Bitcoin Depot are subject to various regulatory challenges and uncertainties. The Company's ability to operate and expand its cryptocurrency kiosk services\nin compliance with applicable laws and regulations is a significant risk that may impact its financial performance and overall business prospects. The regulatory landscape\nsurrounding cryptocurrencies, including the operation of crypto kiosks, is rapidly evolving and can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. The impact of\nheightened regulatory oversight is not yet known. For example, recent legislation in California regulates digital financial asset transaction kiosks (“crypto kiosks”) by\nimposing (i) a limit of $1,000 per day on the amount of funds the kiosk operator can accept from or dispense at its crypto kiosks; (ii) a limit on the direct and indirect charges\nan operator may collect from a customer for a single transaction to the greater of\n-9-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n$5 or 15% of the dollar equivalent of the digital assets involved in the transaction; (iii) requirements that specific information (including the amount of fees, expenses and\ncharges, as well as any spread between the dollar price of the digital asset charged to the customer and the dollar price for that asset listed by a digital asset exchange) be\ndisclosed both prior to a transaction and on transaction receipts printed by crypto kiosks following the transaction; and (iv) requiring operators to provide the California\nDepartment of Financial Protection and Innovation with a list of all locations of the crypto kiosks that the operator owns, operates or manages in California. Other state\nagencies may propose and adopt new regulations (or interpret existing regulations) in ways that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for\ncryptocurrencies, regardless of whether these or other new laws are adopted.\nThe Company's financial performance and ability to achieve its business objectives may be significantly impacted by the outcome of ongoing regulatory discussions and\npotential changes in the regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies in California and in other states that have passed, or may pass, similar legislation. These\nuncertainties have resulted in lower revenue and may continue to result in lower revenue and margin, increased compliance costs, operational restrictions, or limitations on the\nCompany's ability to expand its services or enter new markets. Compliance with current and proposed legislation that has not yet been published may be more challenging\nand costly than anticipated.\nIn addition, the Company's ability to obtain and maintain the necessary licenses, permits, and approvals from state regulatory authorities is subject to various factors beyond\nits control, including changes in laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in penalties, fines, or even the suspension or\ntermination of the Company's operations in the state.\n(2) Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Presentation\n(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)\nThe unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”) with respect to interim reporting. The unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2023 on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. The Company has included all normal\nrecurring items and adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim period. The Company’s interim unaudited consolidated financial statements are\nnot necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year.\nThe Company consolidates business enterprises that it controls by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required\neven though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. An enterprise must consolidate a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”)\nif it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact\nthe entity’s economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The\nCompany consolidates all entities that it controls by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Bitcoin Depot Inc. and its controlled subsidiaries: BT HoldCo LLC (\"BT HoldCo\"), Bitcoin\nDepot Operating, LLC, Mintz Assets, Inc., Express Vending, Inc., Intuitive Software, LLC, Digital Gold Ventures, Inc. (“Digital Gold”), BitAccess Inc., AUS BTM Pty Ltd,\nand BTM Solutions India Private Limited. BT HoldCo is a holding company with ownership of Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC. Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC is a holding\ncompany with ownership of Mintz Assets, Inc. and Intuitive Software, LLC. Mintz Assets, Inc. is a holding company that holds the ownership of Express Vending, Inc.\nExpress Vending, Inc. is a Canadian corporation whose business activities include owning and operating a network of BTM kiosks in Canada. Intuitive Software, LLC is a\nholding company that holds an 82.14% equity interest (through its ownership of Digital Gold) in BitAccess Inc., a Canadian corporation. The non-controlling interests held\nby investors directly in BT HoldCo and BitAccess are presented separately as further discussed in Note 10.

(“GSRM”) was a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on October 14, 2021, for the purpose of effecting a\nmerger or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On March 1, 2022, GSRM\n-10-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nconsummated its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). On August 24, 2022, GSRM entered into a Transaction Agreement, as subsequently amended (the “Transaction\nAgreement”), by and among GSRM, GSR II Meteora Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), Lux Vending, LLC (dba Bitcoin Depot) (“Legacy Bitcoin Depot”) and BT Assets, Inc.\n(“BT Assets”) (the “Transaction Agreement”). Prior to the events contemplated in the Transaction Agreement (collectively, the \"Merger\"), BT Assets was the sole owner\nand member in Legacy Bitcoin Depot (the \"Member\").\nOn June 30, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), Legacy Bitcoin Depot merged with and into Bitcoin Depot Operating LLC (“BT OpCo”), with BT OpCo surviving the Merger as the\npost-transaction operating company owned solely by a newly formed entity, BT HoldCo with common units (the “BT HoldCo Common Units”), preferred units (the “BT\nHoldCo Preferred Units”) and earnout units (the “BT HoldCo Earnout Units”) outstanding and issued to BT Assets. In connection with the Merger, GSRM changed its name\nto Bitcoin Depot Inc., purchased BT HoldCo Common Units owned by BT Assets and was issued BT HoldCo Earnout Units and warrants to purchase a number of BT\nHoldCo Common Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock that may be purchased upon the exercise in full of all Warrants outstanding immediately\nafter Closing (“BT HoldCo Matching Warrants”). The former owners of Legacy Bitcoin Depot (i.e., BT Assets and the owners thereof) were issued 44,100,000 non-\neconomic, super voting shares of Class V common stock in Bitcoin Depot. The Class V common stock held by BT Assets corresponds to units held by BT Assets in BT\nHoldCo and represents non-controlling interests in the Company, as described in Note 11. Following the closing of the Merger, the Company is organized under an “Up-C”\nstructure in which the business of the Company is operated by BT HoldCo and its subsidiaries, and Bitcoin Depot’s only material direct asset consists of equity interests in\nBT HoldCo. At June 30, 2023, the Company had issued and outstanding 12,358,691 common units, 4,300,000 Series A Preferred Units and 43,848,750 warrants in BT\nHoldCo. Also at June 30, 2023, BT Assets owned 41,200,000 common units, 2,900,000 Founder Preferred Units, 5,000,000 Class 1 Earnout Units, 5,000,000 Class 2\nEarnout Units and 5,000,000 Class 3 Earnout Units in BT HoldCo.\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Merger pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. The Merger was\naccounted for as a common control transaction and reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), as BT\nAssets controls BT OpCo both before and after the transactions. Legacy Bitcoin Depot is determined to be the predecessor and represents a continuation of BT OpCo’s\nbalance sheet and consolidated statement of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income, reflective of the recapitalization of the Merger.\nAs a result of the reverse capitalization accounting, the assets and liabilities of Legacy Bitcoin Depot are reflected by the Company at their historical cost with no additional\ngoodwill or intangible assets recorded, accompanied by a recapitalization of the equity structure.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company’s Class A common stock is now listed on the National Association of Securities of Dealers Automated Quotations (“Nasdaq”)\nunder the symbol BTM and the Warrants to purchase the Class A common stock are listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol BTMWW in lieu of the GSRM Ordinary Shares\nand GSRM’s warrants, respectively. GSRM’s units automatically separated into the GSRM’s Ordinary Shares and GSRM’s warrants and ceased trading separately on the\nNasdaq following the Closing Date. Prior to the Merger, GSRM neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue. Until the Merger, based on GSRM’s business\nactivities, it was a shell company as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nThe consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations prior to the Merger reflect those of Legacy Bitcoin Depot, which represents the predecessor of the Company. All\nsuch references to the Company for periods prior to the Merger refer to the activity of Lux Vending, LLC.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company became the sole managing member of BT HoldCo, which holds all of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, and has the sole\nauthority to make the key operating decisions on behalf of BT HoldCo. As such, the Company determined that BT HoldCo is a VIE and the Company is the primary\nbeneficiary. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of BT HoldCo.\n(b) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, valuation of current and deferred income taxes, the determination of the useful\nlives of property and equipment, recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, fair value of long-term debt, present value of lease liabilities and\n-11-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nright-of-use assets, assumptions and inputs for fair value measurements used in business combinations, impairments of cryptocurrencies, share-based compensation and\ncontingencies, including liabilities that the Company deems are not probable of assertion. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n(c) Concentration of Credit Risk Arising from Cash Deposits in Excess of Insured Limits\nThe Company maintains cash in established U.S. and Canadian financial institutions that often will exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any\nlosses in such accounts that are maintained at the financial institutions.\nThe Company maintains cash balances in its BTMs and in fiat wallets with cryptocurrency exchanges to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies. The cash\nbalances in the BTMs are insured up to a specified limit. From time to time, the Company’s cash balance in the BTMs exceeds such limits. The Company had cash balances\nof $11.8 million and $12.2 million in BTMs at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Cash maintained in fiat wallets with cryptocurrency exchanges is\nnot insured. The Company had $0.1 million in cash with cryptocurrency exchanges as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nA significant customer concentration is defined as one from whom at least 10% of revenue is derived. The Company had no significant customer concentration for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash maintained at various financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, and in BTMs owned and leased by the Company.\nCash in transit consists of cash that is picked up by armored truck companies from the Company’s BTM machines but not yet deposited in the Company’s bank accounts.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash in transit of $4.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Management evaluates cash in transit\nbased on outstanding cash deposits on cash picked up by the armored truck companies, historical cash deposits and cash that is lost during transit, which is immaterial. The\narmored truck companies maintain insurance over theft and losses.\n(e) Cryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrencies are a unit of account that function as a medium of exchange on a respective blockchain network, a digital and decentralized ledger that keeps a record of\nall transactions that take place across a peer-to-peer network. The Company primarily purchases cryptocurrencies to sell to customers. The Company’s cryptocurrencies\nprimarily consisted of Bitcoin (“BTC”) as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company accounts for cryptocurrencies as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350,(cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:9)\n(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:28) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:11) , and they are recorded on the Company’s consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, less any impairments. The Company has control and ownership of its\ncryptocurrencies which are stored in both the Company’s proprietary hot wallets and hot wallets hosted by a third-party, BitGo, Inc.\nThe primary purpose of the Company’s operations is to buy and sell Bitcoin using the BTM kiosk network and other services. The Company does not engage in broker-\ndealer activities. The Company uses various exchanges and liquidity providers to purchase, liquidate and manage its cryptocurrency positions; however, this does not\nimpact the accounting for these assets as intangible assets.\nIn June 2024, the Company announced plans to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to Bitcoin. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had Bitcoin with an adjusted cost\nbasis of $0.7 million allocated to its treasury strategy within Cryptocurrencies on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:31) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:31) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)!(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)\" (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:31)\nIn accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), the Company determined that it has a safeguarding obligation with respect to cryptocurrencies held in third-\nparty operator wallets and in a shared wallet with one of its liquidity providers. The Company has certain obligations to safeguard these assets and/or private keys from loss,\ntheft, or other misuse. The Company has adopted measures to safeguard crypto assets it secures, including establishing security around private key management to minimize\nthe risk of theft or loss. The Company measures the safeguarding obligation liability initially and subsequently at the fair value of the digital\n-12-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nasset per the principal market in accordance with ASC 820, (cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)# (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7), at midnight UTC on the last day of the reporting period. The custody asset is measured\nin the same manner, however, the carrying amount may be adjusted to reflect any actual or potential safeguarding loss events, such as those resulting from fraud or theft.\n(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:9)\nBecause the Company’s cryptocurrencies are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, the cryptocurrencies are tested for impairment annually or more frequently\nif events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired in accordance with ASC 350. The Company has determined that a decline\nin the quoted market price below the carrying value at any time during the assessed period is viewed as an impairment indicator because the cryptocurrencies are traded in\nactive markets where there are observable prices. Therefore, the fair value is used to assess whether an impairment loss should be recorded. If the fair value of the\ncryptocurrency decreases below the initial cost basis or the carrying value during the assessed period, an impairment charge is recognized at that time in cost of revenue\n(excluding depreciation and amortization). After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of the cryptocurrency becomes its new accounting basis\nand this new cost basis will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value. For purposes of measuring impairment on its cryptocurrencies, the Company\ndetermines the fair value of its cryptocurrency on a non-recurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, (cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)# (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)% based on quoted (unadjusted) prices on an\nactive exchange in the United States that the Company has determined is its principal market (Level 1 inputs).\nThe Company purchases cryptocurrencies, which are held in the Company’s hot wallets, on a just-in-time basis to facilitate sales to customers and mitigate exposure to\nvolatility in cryptocurrency prices. The Company sells its cryptocurrencies to its customers from its BTM kiosks and BDCheckout locations in exchange for cash, for a\nprescribed transaction fee applied to the current market price of the cryptocurrency at the time of the transaction, plus a predetermined markup. When the cryptocurrency is\nsold to customers, the Company relieves the adjusted cost basis of its cryptocurrency, net of impairments, on a first-in, first-out basis within cost of revenue (excluding\ndepreciation and amortization).\nThe Company also allocates a portion of its cash reserves to Bitcoin. If the fair value of the cryptocurrency decreases below the initial cost basis or the carrying value\nduring the period, an impairment charge is recognized at that time. After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of the cryptocurrency becomes its\nnew accounting basis and will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value.\nThe related cash flows from purchases and sales of cryptocurrencies are presented as cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe related cash flows from investments in and sales of cryptocurrencies are presented as cash flows from investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows.\nSee Notes 2(i) and 2(j) to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s revenue recognition and cost of revenue related to the\nCompany’s cryptocurrencies.\n(f) Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Finance leases are stated at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, less\naccumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, and the related\naccumulated depreciation are eliminated from their respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and\nComprehensive (Loss) Income upon disposition.\nDepreciation of property and equipment is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\nFurniture and fixtures 7 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or life of the lease\nKiosk machines - owned 7 years\nKiosk machines - leased 2-7 years\nVehicles 5 years\n-13-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nDepreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $7.1 million, and $8.4 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $1.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively.\nIn connection with an assessment of the estimated useful lives of the Company's owned and leased kiosks conducted in July 2024, the Company determined that the\nestimated useful lives of its owned and leased kiosks should be increased from 5 years to 7 years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning August 1,\n2024 and is being applied on a prospective basis to the owned and leased kiosks on the Company's balance sheet as of July 31, 2024, as well as to subsequent kiosk leases or\npurchases. Based on the net carrying amount of assets in use as of August 1, 2024, the impact of this change was a reduction of $0.8 million in depreciation expense during\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and no change to either basic or diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n(g) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to its fair value, which is normally determined through\nanalysis of the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If such asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured\nby the amount that the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. There were no impairments of long-lived assets for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n(h) Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and any non-controlling interest in the\nacquired entity in a business combination. The Company tests for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company performs their annual test for impairment as of December 31 at the\nreporting unit level. There was no impairment of goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nIntangible assets, net consists of tradenames, customer relationships, and software applications. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated lives and\nevaluated for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that warrants such a review. Management periodically evaluates whether changes to estimated\nuseful lives of intangible assets are necessary to ensure its estimates accurately reflect the economic use of the related intangible assets.\n(i) Revenue Recognition\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)’ (cid:0)$ (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)( (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)& (cid:0)* (cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:9)\nRevenue is principally derived from the sale of cryptocurrencies at the point-of-sale on transactions initiated by customers. These customer-initiated transactions are\ngoverned by terms and conditions agreed to at the time of each point-of-sale transaction and do not extend beyond the transaction. The Company charges a fee at the\ntransaction level. The transaction price for the customer is the price of the cryptocurrency, which is based on the exchange value at the time of the transaction, plus a\nmarkup, and a flat fee. The exchange value is determined using real-time exchange prices and the markup percentage is determined by the Company and depends on the\ncurrent market, competition, the geography of the location of the sale, and the method of purchase.\nThe Company’s revenue from contracts with customers is principally comprised of a single performance obligation to provide cryptocurrencies when customers buy\ncryptocurrencies at a BTM kiosk or through BDCheckout. BDCheckout sales are similar to sales from BTM kiosks in that, customers buy cryptocurrencies with cash;\nhowever, the BDCheckout transactions are completed at the checkout counter of retail locations, initiated using the Bitcoin Depot mobile app instead of through the BTM\nkiosks. Regardless of the method by which the customer purchases the cryptocurrency, the Company considers its performance obligation satisfied when control of the\ncryptocurrency is transferred to the customer, which is at the point in time the cryptocurrency is transferred to the customer’s cryptocurrency wallet and the transaction\nvalidated on the blockchain.\nThe typical process time for our transactions with customers is 30 minutes or less. Contract liabilities are amounts received from customers in advance of the Company\ntransferring the cryptocurrencies to the customer’s wallet and the transaction validated on the blockchain. Contract liabilities are presented in “Deferred revenue” on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and are not material as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n-14-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with customers. The Company evaluates the presentation of revenue\non a gross or net basis based on whether it controls the cryptocurrency before control is transferred to the customer (gross) or whether it acts as an agent by arranging for\nother customers on the platform to provide the cryptocurrency to the customer (net). The Company controls the cryptocurrency before it is transferred to the customer, has\nownership risk related to the cryptocurrency (including market price volatility), sets the transaction fee to be charged, and is responsible for transferring the cryptocurrency\nto the customer upon purchase. Therefore, the Company is the principal in transactions with customers and presents revenue and cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and\namortization) from the sale of cryptocurrencies on a gross basis.\n(j) Cost of Revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nThe Company’s cost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs related to selling cryptocurrencies and operating the Company’s network of BTM kiosks. The cost of\nrevenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) caption includes cryptocurrency expenses, floorspace lease expenses, and kiosk operations expenses.\n(cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:31) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:31) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)\nCryptocurrency expenses include the cost of cryptocurrencies, fees paid to obtain cryptocurrencies, impairment of cryptocurrencies, gains on sales of cryptocurrencies on\nexchange, fees paid to operate the software on the BTM kiosks, and fees paid to transfer cryptocurrencies to customers.\n(cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)\nFloorspace lease expenses include lease expense related to the placement of BTM kiosks.\n(cid:0)( (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)\nKiosk operations expenses include the cost of kiosk repair and maintenance and the cost of armored trucks to collect and transport cash deposited into the BTM kiosks.\nThe Company presents cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income exclusive of depreciation related to BTM kiosks\nand amortization of intangible assets related to software applications, tradenames and customer relationships.\n(k) Advertising\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses were $4.8 million and $4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Advertising expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Amounts are included in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.\n(l) Foreign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company is the USD. The functional currency of Express Vending, Inc. is the Canadian Dollar. All revenue, cost and expense accounts are\ntranslated at an average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate as of the\nbalance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity, identified as accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss.\n(m) Income Taxes\nBitcoin Depot Inc. is treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.\nBT HoldCo is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC is a single-member limited liability company and owned by BT\nHoldCo and with the consent of BT HoldCo, has elected under the Internal Revenue Code and similar state statutes to be a disregarded entity. In lieu of federal corporate\nincome taxes, Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC reflects its operating results on BT HoldCo’s federal tax return as a division of the partnership. As such, there were no federal\nincome taxes for these entities.\n-15-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nMintz Assets, Inc., is treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Intuitive Software, LLC., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Gold, are treated as\ncorporations for federal income tax purposes. BitAccess Inc., and Express Vending, Inc., are each taxed as Canadian corporations. For the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, there was no activity for Mintz Assets, Inc., Intuitive Software, LLC and Digital Gold. As such, there were no federal income taxes for these entities.\nDeferred taxes are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to\ntaxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe effect of any tax rate change on deferred taxes is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change. Realization of deferred tax assets is\nassessed on an annual basis and, unless a deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be utilized, a valuation allowance is recorded to write down the deferred tax assets to\ntheir net realizable value. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of\nthe deferred income tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during\nthe periods in which those deductible temporary differences reverse. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future\ntaxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. For uncertain income tax positions, the Company uses a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold\nbased on the technical merits of the income tax position taken. Income tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured in order to\ndetermine the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements. The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax\nexpense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\n(n) Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nCertain assets and liabilities are reported or disclosed at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the Company’s principal market for such transactions. If the Company has not established a\nprincipal market for such transactions, fair value is determined based on the most advantageous market. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes fair value\nmeasurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n•Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\n•Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities,\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data\nfor substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n•Level 3: Inputs that are generally unobservable, supported by little or no market activity, and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe categorization of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation\ntechniques used by the Company when measuring fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n(o) Share-Based Compensation\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:17)\nThe Company maintains an equity award plan under which the officers and employees of BitAccess were awarded various types of share-based compensation, including\noptions to purchase shares of BitAccess’ common stock and restricted stock units.\nFor stock options, share-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant, as estimated using\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model requires management to make a number of assumptions, including the fair value and expected volatility of BitAccess'\nunderlying BitAccess common stock price, expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield. The fair value of the underlying stock is the\nestimated fair value of BitAccess common stock on the date of\n-16-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\ngrant. The expected stock price volatility assumption for BitAccess' stock is determined by using a weighted average of the historical stock price volatility of comparable\ncompanies from a representative peer group, as BitAccess stock is not actively traded. The Company uses historical exercise information and contractual terms of options to\nestimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds with terms consistent\nwith the expected term of the award at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on BitAccess’ history and expectation of no dividend payouts.\n(cid:0), (cid:0)- (cid:0), (cid:0). (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:28) (cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2)\nIn conjunction with the close of the Merger the Company established the Bitcoin Depot Inc. 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) under which officers,\ndirectors, and employees may be awarded various types of share-based compensation, including but not limited to, restricted stock, stock options, and restricted stock units.\nUnder the Incentive Plan, the Company has granted time-based and issued performance-based restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"). The Company recognizes compensation\nexpense for the RSUs in accordance with ASC 718 - (cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:2) , (\"ASC 718\").\nFor RSUs, share-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the Company’s Class A common stock at the closing price on the day before the date of grant.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with time-based RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the award’s requisite service period (generally the vesting\nperiod). Share-based compensation expense associated with performance-based RSUs is determined based on the number of performance-based RSUs that are earned based\non the Company's achievement of certain adjusted EBITDA targets that are determined and approved by the Company's Compensation Committee at its sole discretion.\nForfeitures of awards granted under the Incentive Plan are accounted for at the time the forfeiture occurs.\n(p) Segment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating\nDecision Maker (the “CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the\nCompany’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a global, consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources,\nand evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment and one reportable segment.\n(q) Net Income Per Share Attributable to Class A Common Stock\nBasic earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A\ncommon stock outstanding and Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, which has similar economic rights to the Class A common stock during the same period. Diluted net\nincome per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common\nstock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities. Potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed\nexercise of stock options and warrants, vesting of RSUs, vesting of Class E common stock and Class V common stock and conversion of the Company’s preferred stock, as\napplicable. The weighted-average shares outstanding used to compute net income per common share, basic and diluted, were 20,701,447 and 18,908,391 for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The weighted-average shares outstanding used to compute net income per common share, basic and diluted, were\n16,658,691 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n(r) Litigation\nThe Company assesses legal contingencies in accordance with ASC 450 - (cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:17) and determines whether a legal contingency is probable, reasonably possible or\nremote. When contingencies become probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company records an estimate of the probable loss. When contingencies are considered\nprobable or reasonably possible but cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the contingency when the probable or reasonably possible loss could be material.\nLegal costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.\n(s) Earnouts\nAt the closing of the Merger, GSRM received a total of 1,075,761 earnout shares (“Sponsor Earnout Shares”) in the form of Class E common stock of the Company. In\ncurrent form, the Sponsor Earnout Shares are represented by the Company’s Class E-1, E-2, and E-3 common stock, each class comprising of one-third (1/3) of the total\nSponsor Earnout Shares, or 358,587 shares each. Class E-1 Shares automatically convert to Class A common stock if during the seven-year period following the closing of\nthe Merger, the Company’s stock price is greater than $12.00 over 10 trading days (which may be consecutive or not consecutive) within any 20\n-17-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nconsecutive trading days (“First Milestone”). Class E-2 and Class E-3 are subject to similar milestones. The “Second Milestone” is reached when the Company’s stock\nprice is greater than $14.00 per share over any 10 trading days (which may be consecutive or not consecutive) within any 20 consecutive trading days during the seven-year\nperiod following the Merger. The “Third Milestone” has a threshold of $16.00 per share over any 10 trading days (which may be consecutive or not consecutive) within any\n20 consecutive trading days during the 10-year period following the Merger.\nIn addition to the Sponsor Earnout Shares, certain owners of BT HoldCo are entitled to receive an additional 15,000,000 BT HoldCo Earnout Units (“BT Earnout”). The BT\nEarnout is structured similarly to the Sponsor Earnout Shares with consistent milestones and vesting conditions.\nThe Company evaluated the Sponsor Earnout Shares and BT HoldCo Earnout Shares under ASC 815-40, (cid:0)* (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)1 (cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:31) (cid:0)3(cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:28) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)4 (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:31) , and\nconcluded equity classification is appropriate. As equity-classified contracts, the Sponsor Earnout Shares are not subject to remeasurement provided the conditions for\nequity-classification continue to be met. The Sponsor Earnout Shares have been recorded in connection with the reverse recapitalization accounting as part of the adjustment\nto accumulated deficit due to the absence of additional paid in capital.\nIn connection with the Merger, the BT Earnout will be settled in Common Units which represent non-controlling interest, to be measured under the hypothetical liquidation at\nbook value method, as described further in Note 11.\n(t) Warrants\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company assumed a total of 43,848,750 Warrants, consisting of 31,625,000 Public Warrants and 12,223,750 Private Placement Warrants\nissued by GSRM which continue to be outstanding following the Merger.

There are no other voting rights associated with the Series A\nPreferred Stock.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is only entitled to dividends when and if declared by the Company’s Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). There is no stated dividend preference.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock participate fully with respect to all distributions and dividends made to the Company’s Class A common stock, including in the event of a\nliquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holders into Class A common stock at an initial exchange ratio of 1:1, as adjusted for any dilutive\nevents. The Series A Preferred Stock is economically identical to the Company’s Class A common stock and is therefore treated as another class of common stock for\nreporting purposes (i.e., net income per share calculation),\n-30-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nand is classified in permanent equity. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 0 and 50,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, respectively were\nconverted to shares of Class A common stock.\nWarrants\nThere are 43,848,750 warrants outstanding of which 31,625,000 (“Public Warrants”) were issued by GSRM at the time of its IPO and 12,223,750 (“Private Warrants” and\ntogether the “Warrants”) were issued by GSRM to GSR II Meteora Sponsor LLC (“Sponsor”). As a result of the Merger, these Warrants became Bitcoin Depot Warrants.\nEach whole Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. A holder may exercise its warrants only for a\nwhole number of shares of Class A common stock. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The Company may\nredeem the Public Warrants at a price of $0.01 per share if the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading\ndays within a 30-trading day period. The Private Warrants cannot be redeemed, even if sold or transferred to a non-affiliate. The Warrants will expire five years after the\nClosing Date, June 30, 2028, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company also has the ability to redeem outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become\nexercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant, provided that the last reported sale price of Class A common stock for any 20 trading days\nwithin a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the Public Warrant holders equals or exceeds\n$18.00 per share and provided certain other conditions are met.\nThe Private Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Public Warrants, except the Private Warrants are not subject to redemption, and do not\nbecome subject to redemption after transfer to a non-affiliate (a distinction from other private placement warrants issued in connection with GSRM transactions).\nThe Warrants are accounted for as freestanding equity contracts and are classified in equity under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Warrants were recorded in connection with the reverse recapitalization accounting as part of the adjustment to accumulated deficit on the\nconsolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity.\nEarnouts\nIn connection with the Merger, the Sponsor received the Sponsor Earnout Shares, divided into three classes of Class E common stock: E-1, E-2, and E-3, respectively. All\nclasses of Class E common stock are held by a single party. Upon achieving certain milestones (described below), each share of Class E common stock is automatically\nconverted into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Class E common stock shares do not have any voting or economic rights, and\nthey represent the right to receive shares of Class A common stock.\nIn addition to the Sponsor Earnout Shares described above, BT HoldCo also issued earnout units (“BT HoldCo Earnout Units”), of which 1,075,061 were issued to the\nCompany and 15,000,000 were issued to BT Assets, Inc. The BT HoldCo Earnout Units issued by BT HoldCo are subject to the same vesting conditions as the Sponsor\nEarnout Shares. Upon vesting, these units will be automatically exchanged into common units of BT HoldCo. BT HoldCo Earnout Units held by the Company mirror the\nSponsor Earnout Shares arrangement as they are intended to maintain the UP-C corporation structure of the consolidated reporting group (i.e., for every share of Class A\ncommon stock outstanding, the Company will own a corresponding common unit in BT HoldCo). BT HoldCo Earnout Units issued to BT Assets, will impact the non-\ncontrolling interest recognized by the Company when they vest.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the market price of the Company's Class A common stock did not exceed the required price per share. Additionally, in\naccordance with the earnout provisions, the market price of the Company's Class A common stock did not exceed $12.00 per share for any 10 trading days within any\nconsecutive 20 trading day period after the Merger to achieve the 1st vesting hurdle.\n(cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:12)\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company announced that its Board has authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to\n$10.0 million of outstanding shares of its Class A common stock through and including September 30, 2024. The Company made an accounting policy election to measure\nthe fair value of purchases or sales of securities, including purchases of its own shares as part of the share repurchase program, as of the trade date.\n-31-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 69,976 shares at a total cost of $0.2 million with an average cost per share of $2.26. No shares\nwere repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. No shares were repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024. From the date of\nauthorization through September 30, 2024, 190,620 shares of the Company's Class A common stock had been repurchased with a total cost of $0.4 million.

In connection with any redemption or exchange, the Company receives a corresponding number of\nLLC Interests, increasing its total ownership interest in BT HoldCo. Simultaneously, and in connection with a redemption, the corresponding number of shares of Class V\ncommon shares and Common BT HoldCo units are surrendered and cancelled. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, BT Assets exchanged 0 and\n2,906,976 Class V shares. This exchange in the second quarter of 2024 resulted in a transfer of 4.3% ownership interest in BT HoldCo from BT Assets to the Company.\n(15) Income Taxes\nPrior to the closing of the Merger, Lux Vending, LLC was wholly-owned by BT Assets, which elected to be taxed as an S Corporation. Lux Vending, LLC elected to be taxed\nas an S Corporation subsidiary and was not directly subject to US Federal income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively was (16.52%) and 45.1%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nand 2023, the Company recognized income tax (expense) benefit of $(0.5) million and $1.0 million, respectively, on its share of pre-tax book income (loss), of which $0.9\nmillion and $(0.7) million was attributed to non-controlling interest.\nBitAccess Inc. and Express Vending, Inc. are taxed as Canadian corporations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, there was no activity for Mintz\nAssets, Inc., Intuitive Software, LLC and Digital Gold. As such, there were no federal income taxes for these entities.\nThe effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate of 21.0% primarily due to the income or loss not being taxed due to the income and loss flowing through to\nits partners, and differences related to the foreign operations, and valuation allowance adjustments for the Company’s outside basis in BT HoldCo.\nAs of September 30, 2024, management determined based on applicable accounting standards and the weight of all available evidence, it was not more likely than not\n(“MLTN”) that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets for the difference in tax basis in excess of the financial reporting value for its investment in BT HoldCo.\nConsequently, the Company has established a full valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax asset related to its investment in BT HoldCo, as of September 30, 2024.\nIn the event that management subsequently determines that it is MLTN that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future over the recorded amount, a decrease\nto the valuation allowance will be made, which will reduce the provision for income taxes. Additionally, the Company has an uncertain tax position of $1.1 million due to\nstate tax filings. The Company plans to settle open filings during 2024.\n(cid:0)’ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:9)\nUpon the completion of the Merger, Bitcoin Depot is party to the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”). Under the terms of that agreement, Bitcoin Depot generally will be\nrequired to pay BT Assets 85% of the tax savings, if any, that Bitcoin Depot Inc. realizes, or in certain circumstances is deemed to realize, as a result of certain tax attributes\nthat are created as part of and after the Merger. The payment of cash consideration to BT Assets in connection with the transaction will result in aggregate payments under the\nTax Receivable Agreement of approximately $2.1 million as of September 30, 2024. This amount does not take into account any future exchanges of BT HoldCo Common\nUnits by BT Assets pursuant to the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement. The future amounts payable, as well as the timing of any\npayments, under the Tax Receivable Agreement are dependent upon significant future events, including (but not limited to) the timing of the exchanges of BT HoldCo\nCommon Units and\n-32-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nsurrender of a corresponding number of shares of Bitcoin Depot Class V common stock, the price of Bitcoin Depot Class A common stock at the time of each exchange, the\nextent to which such exchanges are taxable transactions, the depreciation and amortization periods that apply to any increase in tax basis resulting from such exchanges, the\ntypes of assets held by BT HoldCo, the amount and timing of taxable income Bitcoin Depot generates in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rate then applicable and the\nportion of Bitcoin Depot’s payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. The Company\nhas recognized a Tax Receivable Agreement liability of $0.9 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. Changes in this liability will be recognized\nin future periods through the other income/(expense) benefit caption on the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income, the Company\ninitially recorded $0.7 million on September 30, 2023 through equity, an additional adjustment $0.2 million was made on December 31, 2023, which was recorded to the\nincome statement, for a total TRA of $0.9 million.\nPursuant to the Company's election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the\nnet assets of BT HoldCo when units are redeemed or exchanged by the other members of BT HoldCo. The Company plans to make an election under Section 754 of the Code\nfor each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of BT HoldCo units occurs. The Company intends to treat any redemptions and exchanges of BT HoldCo units as\ndirect purchases of the units for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that would otherwise be paid in the future to various\ntax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.\nOn April 24, 2024, the Company acquired an aggregate of 2.9 million units in connection with an exchange with BT HoldCo (see Note 14), which resulted in an increase in\nthe tax basis of its investment in BT HoldCo subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Company also recorded an additional liability of $1.3 million for\nthe TRA Payments due to the redeeming members, representing 85% of the aggregate tax benefits the Company expects to realize from the tax basis increases related to the\nexchange of units, after concluding it was probable that such TRA Payments would be paid based on estimates of future taxable income. No payments were made to the\nmembers of BT HoldCo pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\n(16) Share-Based Compensation\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0);\nBitAccess maintained a stock option plan for its employees under the Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan, (the “BitAccess Plan”).

As a result, the weighted average Series A Preferred Stock outstanding during the period was included in the calculation of weighted average\ncommon stock outstanding. No other classes of shares with economic rights were outstanding during the period, and therefore, EPS was not presented for such classes. The\nPublic and Private Warrants along with the BitAccess options were considered in diluted EPS under the treasury stock method, if dilutive. The Class E common stock\nrepresents earnout arrangements that are contingently issuable into Class A common stock, and are only considered in the calculation of EPS once the stock price milestones\nhave been achieved. The non-controlling interest was considered in diluted EPS under the if-converted method, if dilutive.\nThe share-based compensation expense related to Class A shares has been attributed entirely to Bitcoin Depot Inc. for purposes of the net income (loss) per share calculation\nwithin the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Additionally, for purposes of the net income (loss) per share calculation, because\nsuch amounts pertain to compensation expense that do not affect the net assets of BT HoldCo available for liquidation, they are not further attributed to the non-controlling\ninterest holders under the HLBV method described in Note 11.\nManagement determined that EPS for periods prior to the Merger was not considered meaningful due to the complexities of determining the weighted average stock\noutstanding as a result of the recapitalization.

The new leases commenced on March\n31, 2023, June 30, 2023 or September 30, 2023 and have three year noncancellable periods. Total fixed payments due on an undiscounted basis over the three year\nnoncancellable period of the leases are $7.1 million. The Company will acquire the assets for a bargain purchase price of $1 at the end of the term. Due to the bargain purchase\noption, the Company classified the new leases as finance leases. The Company recognized a finance lease liability of $5.7 million discounted at an interest rate implicit in the\nlease and a corresponding right-of-use asset of $5.7 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company entered into lease agreements for the lease of 1,186 new BTMs. The leases have noncancellable lease terms\nranging from 24 months to 36 months.

Except as noted below,\nthere are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.\nThe Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably\nestimable. These contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.\nThe Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect\non its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.\nOn January 13, 2023, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (“Canaccord”) commenced proceedings against the Company by filing a claim with the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto,\nOntario which named Lux Vending, LLC and Bitcoin Depot LLC as the defendants. Canaccord is a financial services firm in Canada that the Company previously had hired\nto perform advisory services related to a potential initial public offering or sales transaction. The claim asserts that Lux Vending, LLC breached the contract by terminating\nthe contract to avoid paying fees for their services and that Canaccord is entitled to approximately $22.3 million in damages equivalent to the fees alleged to be payable for\nbreach of contract that would have been owed upon the closing of a transaction to acquire control, the sale of substantially all the Company’s assets, or a merger transaction\npursuant to the previously terminated engagement letter for advisory services. Canaccord proposes that the amount of fees would be calculated on the total transaction value of\nthe business combination that Canaccord now values at $655 million.. The claim also seeks an award for legal and other costs relating to the proceeding. On October 25,\n2023, Canaccord amended their complaint to increase the amount of the claim by $0.7 million to roughly $23 million and to add Bitcoin Depot Operating LLC as a defendant\nto account for the name change following the closing of the merger. The increase in the claim is the result of Canaccord changing the estimated transaction value from $615 to\n$655 million.\nBitcoin Depot does not believe the allegations made against it are valid and intends to vigorously defend against them. The range of potential loss related to the identified\nclaim is between $0 and $23.0 million, the amount of damages that Canaccord is seeking in the lawsuit. The additional costs mentioned in the claim are not able to be\nestimated at this time. The discovery phase of the litigation involving documentary productions and oral examinations is largely completed. A mediation of the dispute will\nbe held at the end of fourth quarter of 2024.\n(cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:7)(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:9)\nLegislation or guidance may be issued by U.S. and non-U.S. governing bodies, including Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCen”) and the Internal Revenue\nService (“IRS”), that may differ significantly from the Company’s practices or interpretation of the law, which could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and\nresults of operations, and accordingly, the related impact on our financial condition and results of operations is not estimable.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which Bitcoin Depot’s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of consolidated results\nof operations and financial condition. You should read the following discussion and analysis of Bitcoin Depot’s financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with\nthe unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCertain information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to plans and\nstrategy for Bitcoin Depot’s business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in\n“Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements Safe Harbor Statement,” our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-\nlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company”\nor “Bitcoin Depot” refer to Bitcoin Depot Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nBusiness Overview\nBitcoin Depot owns and operates the largest network of Bitcoin ATMs (“BTMs”) across North America where customers can buy and sell Bitcoin. Bitcoin Depot helps power\nthe digital economy for users of cash.\nOur mission is to bring Crypto to the Masses™. Digital means and systems dominate the way that consumers send money, make purchases, and invest; however, we believe that\nmany people utilize cash as their primary means of initiating a transaction, either as a necessity or as a preference. These individuals have largely been excluded from the digital\nfinancial system and associated technological advancements in our global and digitally interconnected society. Bitcoin Depot’s simple and convenient process to convert cash\ninto Bitcoin via our BTMs and feature-rich mobile app enables not only these users, but also the broader public, to access the digital financial system.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our offerings included approximately 8,304 BTMs in retail locations throughout the U.S. and Canada, our BDCheckout product, which is accepted at\napproximately 7,723 retail locations, and our mobile app. We maintain a leading position among cash-to-Bitcoin BTM operators in the U.S. and Canada.\nKiosk Network and Retailer Relationships\nBitcoin Depot operates a network of kiosks that allow users to purchase Bitcoin with cash. Upon using a Bitcoin Depot kiosk for the first time, users will be prompted to provide\ncertain information for account creation and verification. Users are required to select from three ranges of cash amounts to be inserted in the kiosk for purchasing Bitcoin. The\nuser then provides the address of his or her digital wallet by scanning a QR code or manually inputting his or her unique wallet address; the user can create and use a Bitcoin\nDepot-branded wallet (un-hosted and non-custodial), or his or her own other existing digital wallet. Cash is then inserted by the user into the kiosk, and the kiosk will confirm\nthe dollar amount and other details of the transaction, including quantity of Bitcoin being purchased. Once the transaction is complete, the Bitcoin is electronically delivered to\nthe user’s digital wallet and the user is provided with a physical receipt as well as a receipt via SMS text.\nBitcoin Depot’s largest BTM deployment as of September 30, 2024 is with Circle K, a convenience store chain of over 9,000 stores in North America and over 4,800 stores in\nEurope and other international markets. We are the exclusive provider and operator of BTMs for Circle K in the U.S. and Canada, and as of September 30, 2024 we have\ninstalled our BTMs in approximately 1,200 Circle K stores. We also have kiosks deployed in other convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies, and shopping\nmalls.\nCryptocurrencies\nOur revenues, $436.9 and $540.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, have not been correlated to the price of Bitcoin historically,\neven in light of volatile Bitcoin prices. For example, our revenue during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 declined by 15.2% compared to the same period\nended September 30, 2023, while the market price of Bitcoin increased by 127% during the same period. Based on our own user surveys, a majority of our users use our\nproducts and services for non-speculative purposes, including money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases, among others.\nWe use a sophisticated Bitcoin management process to reduce our exposure to volatility in Bitcoin prices by maintaining a relatively low balance (typically less than $0.6\nmillion) of Bitcoin at any given time, which we believe differentiates us from our competition. Our typical practice is to purchase Bitcoin through a liquidity provider such as\nCumberland DRW or Abra. We replenish our Bitcoin only through purchases from leading Bitcoin liquidity providers and do not engage in any mining of Bitcoin ourselves.\nOur\n-40-\nTable of Contents\nsophisticated replenishment process enables us to satisfy our users’ Bitcoin purchases with our own Bitcoin holdings yet maintain relatively small balances of Bitcoin to\neffectively manage our principal risk related to our operations. There are two main components of the working capital required in our operations. On the Bitcoin side, we\nmaintain Bitcoin in our hot wallets to fulfill orders from users while we are automatically placing orders with liquidity providers and exchanges to replenish the Bitcoin we have\nsold to users. The second component to working capital is the cash that accumulates in the BTM kiosks. As users insert cash into the BTM kiosks, cash accumulates until\narmored carriers collect the cash and process it back to our bank accounts. We typically maintain a variable level of cash in the BTM kiosks at all times. Cash in BTM kiosks as\nof September 30, 2024 was approximately 24.2% of average monthly revenues for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024.\nIn June 2024, the Company announced plans to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to Bitcoin. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held approximately $ 0.7 million of\nBitcoin allocated to its treasury strategy.\nThe Merger\nOn June 30, 2023, we consummated the Merger. GSRM’s stockholders approved the Merger at a special meeting of the stockholders held on June 28, 2023 (the “Special\nMeeting”).\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the following occurred:\n•GSRM filed a Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, pursuant to which GSRM changed its\nname to “Bitcoin Depot Inc.” and the number of authorized shares of our common stock was increased to 2,272,250,000 shares, consisting of (i) 800,000,000 shares of\nClass A common stock, (ii) 20,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, (iii) 300,000,000 shares of Class M common stock, (iv) 800,000,000 shares of Class O\ncommon stock, (v) 300,000,000 shares of Class V common stock, (vi) 2,250,000 shares of Class E common stock, consisting of three series: (a) 750,000 shares of\nClass E-1 common stock, (b) 750,000 shares of Class E-2 common stock and (c) 750,000 shares of Class E-3 common stock, and (vii) 50,000,000 shares of Preferred\nStock;\n•A restructuring was consummated, consisting of (a) the merger of BT OpCo with and into a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company known as “Bitcoin\nDepot Operating LLC”, with Bitcoin Depot Operating LLC surviving the merger and (b) the formation of BT HoldCo LLC (“BT HoldCo”) and contribution of all of\nBT Assets’ equity in BT OpCo to BT HoldCo, pursuant to which BT HoldCo issued BT HoldCo Common Units, BT HoldCo Preferred Units and BT HoldCo Earnout\nUnits to BT Assets; (ii) we paid cash to BT Assets in exchange for certain BT HoldCo Common Units; (iii) we contributed (a) cash to BT HoldCo in exchange for BT\nHoldCo Common Units, (b) warrants issued by BT HoldCo to purchase a number of BT HoldCo Common Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common\nstock that may be purchased upon the exercise in full of all warrants of GSRM outstanding immediately after the closing of the Merger and (c) a number of BT\nHoldCo Earnout Units equal to the number of newly issued shares of Class E common stock issued to Sponsor; (iv) Sponsor exchanged all shares of Class B common\nstock for newly issued shares of Class A common stock and Class E common stock, subject to the terms of conversion or forfeiture and cancellation set forth in that\ncertain Sponsor Support Agreement, dated as of August 24, 2022, by and among Sponsor, GSRM and BT Assets, as amended by the First Amendment to the Sponsor\nSupport Agreement, dated as of June 7, 2023; (v) BT Assets was issued 44,100,000 newly issued shares of Class V common stock, convertible at BT Assets’ election\ninto Class A common stock; and (vi) we issued 500,000 shares of Class A common stock under the Incentive Plan to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company; and\n•upon the execution and delivery to BT OpCo and GSRM of Phantom Equity Award Termination Agreements by the holders of Phantom Equity Awards (as defined\nin the Phantom Plan) outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger were converted into the right to receive, in aggregate cash payments in an amount\nequal to $350,000 and 35,000 restricted stock units, which vest quarterly over one year from the date of grant.\nRegulatory Environment\nWe operate internationally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry,\nincluding countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those\nenacted prior to the advent of digital payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and\nregulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, on October 13, 2023, Governor Newsom signed the California Digital\nFinancial Assets Law and Senate Bill 401, which together will regulate virtual currency activities within the state when the laws become fully effective on July 1, 2025. Some of\nthe\n-41-\nTable of Contents\nprovisions became effective January 1, 2024. These provisions aim to regulate digital financial asset transaction kiosks (“crypto kiosks”) by imposing a daily limit of $1,000 on\nthe amount of funds that the operator can accept from, or dispense to a California resident at its crypto kiosks, which has negatively impacted the Company’s revenue in\nCalifornia.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe monitor and evaluate the following key business metrics to measure performance, identify trends, develop and refine growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We\nbelieve these metrics and measures are useful to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our business, and to facilitate comparisons of our performance to that of our\ncompetitors.\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems. While the\nmeasurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key\nmetrics internationally. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment and we regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from\ntime to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30 June 30 March 31 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31 December 31 September 30\n2024 2023 2022 2021\nInstalled kiosks (at period end) 8,304 8,068 7,061 6,334 6,404 6,351 6,441 6,530 6,787 6,955 6,711 6,220 4,520\nReturning user transaction count 7.3 7.1 7.7 8.3 9.1 9.2 10.0 10.5 11.2 11.5 11.9 12.3 11.5\nMedian kiosk transaction size (in $) 250 230 205 200 200 200 200 200 180 170 176 168 160\nBDCheckout locations (at period end) (1) (3) 7,723 7,441 6,734 5,681 5,681 5,195 2,754 8,661 8,661 8,395 — — —\nKiosks held with logistics providers (2) 2,506 758 587 898 842 981 891 795 — — — — —\n(1)BDCheckout was launched in the second quarter of 2022.\n(2)Includes kiosks held with our logistics providers, the manufacturer, or kiosks that are in-transit to new locations, which we believe will result in higher transaction volume\nand revenue per kiosk once deployed.\n(3)During the first quarter of 2023, one of our retail partners discontinued all BDCheckout and cryptocurrency transactions in its stores.\nInstalled Kiosks\nThis metric provides an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our potential future business opportunities. We define installed kiosks as the number\nof kiosks installed at the end of the quarter in a retail location that are connected to our network. We monitor transaction volume at our kiosks on a continuous basis to maximize\ntransaction volumes from each kiosk. Based on these monitoring activities, we may re-deploy certain of our kiosks, using third-party logistics providers, to new locations (e.g.,\nthose available with our new retail partners) that we believe will maximize transaction volumes and revenues.\nReturning User Transaction Count\nThis metric provides an indicator of user retention and our competitive advantage relative to our peers, as well as the trajectory of cryptocurrency adoption, and allows us to\nmake strategic decisions. We define returning user transaction count as the average number of aggregate transactions completed at any kiosk in the four quarters trailing the\nquarter in which a given user’s first transaction occurred, measured only for users who complete more than one transaction. For example, as of September 30, 2024, users who\nfirst transacted at one of our kiosks during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and who subsequently completed a second transaction completed an average of 7.3\ntransactions over the twelve months following their initial transaction.\nMedian Kiosk Transaction Size\nThis metric provides information to analyze user behavior as well as evaluate our performance and formulate financial projections. We calculate median kiosk transaction size\nbased on the dollar value of all purchases and sales of Bitcoin at our kiosks, including transaction fees, during the rolling twelve month period.\nBDCheckout Locations\nThis metric provides an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our potential future business opportunities. We calculate BDCheckout locations as\nthe number of locations where BDCheckout is available at the end of the quarter. We are currently in discussion with other retail partners to expand our BDCheckout offering\ninto additional locations.\n-42-\nTable of Contents\nSegment Reporting\nOur financial reporting is organized into one segment. We make specific disclosures concerning our products and services because such disclosure facilitates our discussion of\ntrends and operational initiatives within our business and industry. Our products and services are aggregated and viewed by management as one reportable segment due to the\nsimilarity in the nature of the customers and overall economic characteristics, the nature of the products and services provided and the applicable regulatory environment.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the cash paid by customers to purchase Bitcoin from our kiosks. For example, approximately 99.9% of our revenue in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 was derived from the sale of our cryptocurrency, including the markup at which we sell cryptocurrency to users (which can vary\nbetween BDCheckout and BTM kiosks) and a separate flat transaction fee. These user-initiated transactions are governed by terms and conditions agreed to at the time of each\npoint-of-sale transaction and do not extend beyond the transaction.\nFor the periods presented, the markup percentage for BTM kiosk transactions ranged between 15% and 42%, of the USD amount of the transaction with such markup rates\nhistorically having been, and continuing to be, subject to fluctuation as a result of our ongoing price strategy testing. The markup percentage for BDCheckout transactions has\nbeen 15% since the rollout of this type of transaction in 2022. Finally, the Company receives a commission as a percentage for our website transactions which was 12.0%\nthrough September 30, 2024. Markup percentages are determined by examining user transaction patterns in various geographic locations, based on ongoing markup rate testing,\nwith the ultimate aim of optimizing profitability, growth and user base.\nFor each Bitcoin transaction on our kiosks and within BDCheckout, the cryptocurrency price displayed to users includes the exchange rate at which we sell Bitcoin to users as\nwell as a separate flat transaction fee. As of September 30, 2024, we charge (i) a flat $3.00 fee on all transactions at BTM kiosks, which generally corresponds to the costs\nunderlying such transactions and (ii) a flat $3.50 fee on BDCheckout transactions, which is what InComm charges us to facilitate transactions using InComm’s network.\nWe support the sale of Bitcoin by users at only 34 kiosks, or less than 1.0% of our total kiosks as of September 30, 2024, and currently do not have plans to expand the ability of\nour users to sell Bitcoin to us in exchange for cash. We charge the same fees on Bitcoin we purchase from users via our kiosks as we do for Bitcoin we sell to users at our\nkiosks.\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nOur cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization), which is primarily driven by transaction volume, consists primarily of direct costs related to selling Bitcoin and\noperating our network of kiosks. Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) includes the cost of Bitcoin, fees paid to obtain Bitcoin, impairment of\ncryptocurrencies, gains on sales of Bitcoin on an exchange, fees paid to operate the software on the BTMs, rent paid for floorspace for BTMs, fees paid to transfer Bitcoin to\nusers, cost of BTM repair and maintenance, and the cost of armored trucks to collect and transport cash deposited into the BTMs.\nOur costs associated with a BDCheckout transaction are lower than costs associated with a BTM transaction, primarily due to significantly greater operating expenses associated\nwith the BTMs, including cash collection fees and short-term lease payments to the retail locations where the kiosks are placed. However, the profitability of the two services is\nsimilar because of the higher markup that Bitcoin Depot applies to BTM transactions to support the higher costs associated therewith.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our customer support, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, operations, human resources,\nand administrative personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related to fees paid for professional services, including legal, tax, and accounting\nservices.\nDepreciation and amortization include depreciation on computer hardware and software, BTMs (including both BTMs owned by us and those subject to finance leases), office\nfurniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets.\nOther income (expense)\n-43-\nTable of Contents\nOther income (expense) includes interest expense, the impact of lease modifications, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nInterest expense consists primarily of the interest expense on our borrowings and our finance leases and loss on extinguishment of debt.\nResults of Operations\nComparison between Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nStatements of Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income Information:\nRevenue $ 135,271 $ 179,483 $ (44,212) (24.6)%\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization\nreported separately below) 112,853 152,545 (39,692) (26.0)%\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative 14,694 16,242 (1,548) (9.5)%\nDepreciation and amortization 2,245 3,260 (1,015) (31.1)%\nTotal operating expenses $ 16,939 $ 19,502 $ (2,563) (13.1)%\nIncome from operations $ 5,479 $ 7,436 $ (1,957) (26.3)%\nOther income (expense)\nInterest (expense) (2,907 (2,769\n) ) (138) 5.0%\nOther income (expense) 103 (3,111) 3,214 (103.3)%\n(Loss) on foreign currency transactions (29) (154) 125 (81.2)%\nTotal other (expense) $ (2,833) $ (6,034) $ 3,201 (53.0)%\n(Loss) income before provision for income taxes and\nnon-controlling interest 2,646 1,402 1,244 88.7%\nIncome tax benefit (347) (337) (10) 3.0%\nNet (loss) income $ 2,299 $ 1,065 $ 1,234 115.9%\nNet (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest in\nsubsidiary 3,238 8,163 (4,925) (60.3)%\nNet (loss) attributable to Bitcoin Depot Inc. $ (939) $ (7,098) $ 6,159 (86.8)%\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\nNet (loss) income 2,299 1,065 1,234 115.9%\nForeign currency translation adjustments (19) 87 (106) (121.8)%\nTotal comprehensive (loss) income $ 2,280 $ 1,152 $ 1,128 97.9%\nComprehensive (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest $ 3,225 $ 8,249 $ (5,024) (60.9)%\nComprehensive (loss) attributable to Bitcoin\nDepot Inc. $ (945) $ (7,098) $ 6,153 (86.7)%\nRevenue\nRevenue decreased by $44.2 million, or 24.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to\ndecreases in kiosk transaction revenue which was related to decreases in the number of transactions offset slightly by higher average transaction sizes. Additionally, regulatory\nchanges limiting the transaction size in California resulted in lower kiosk revenue in California. In the last quarter of 2023, we uninstalled approximately 1,000 BTMs, which\nwere subsequently reinstalled during the later part of February and March 2024 during our kiosk optimization plan, leading to lower revenue compared to the prior period. In the\nsecond quarter of 2024, the Company activated approximately 1,000 additional kiosks.

Our\nkiosk operations consisted of armored cash collection, bank fees, software costs, insurance and repair and maintenance. These costs were lower during the first quarter of 2023\nprimarily related to repairs and maintenance as a result of the kiosks being in the field for longer periods and needing less repairs, compared to the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 which had more relocation costs. due to the kiosk optimization plan and installing additional kiosks.\n-49-\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million, or 1.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs increased primarily due to higher payroll costs due to headcount increasing from 115 at\nSeptember 30, 2023 to 130 at September 30, 2024 to support our operations.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther expenses decreased by approximately $13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily\ndriven by the recognition of PIPE expenses in the three and nine ended September 30, 2023, which did not recur in 2024. Interest expense increased during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 as a result of an increase to the amount of principal under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The increase of debt principal balance was\nconsidered an extinguishment of our prior debt agreement under US GAAP. This change resulted in the write-off of prior capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.7 million during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 which did not occur in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet income (loss) attributable to Legacy Bitcoin Depot unit holders\nPrior to the close of the Merger, net income was allocated to the Legacy Bitcoin Depot unit holders. After the close of the Merger on June 30, 2023, the Legacy Bitcoin Depot\nunit holders no longer receive any income allocation as they are owners of BT HoldCo.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\nPrior to the close of the Merger, the non-controlling interest reflected Bitcoin Depot’s ownership in BitAccess. Subsequent to the close of the Merger, the non-controlling\ninterest reflect both Bitcoin Depot's ownership in BitAccess and BT HoldCo. After the close of the Merger, up to $29.0 million of the net income from BT OpCo will be\nallocated to BT HoldCo as a result of the preferred return to BT Assets related to their preferred interest in BT HoldCo. If net income exceeds $29.0 million, such excess income\nwill be allocated to Bitcoin Depot and BT HoldCo based on their pro rata economic ownership interest in BT OpCo. Additionally, when losses are incurred, BT HoldCo\nallocates the losses based on the economic ownership. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net Loss of BT OpCo was allocated to BT HoldCo and Bitcoin\nDepot Inc utilizing the HLBV methodology.\nNet income (loss) attributable to Bitcoin Depot Inc.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net Loss was allocated to Bitcoin Depot Inc from BT HoldCo. In addition to losses allocated under the HLBV\nmethodology, the public entity incurred direct legal and professional services in maintaining its operations resulting in a Net Loss attributable to Bitcoin Depot Inc.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn September 30, 2024, we had negative working capital of approximately $(4.3) million, which included cash and cash equivalents and other current assets of approximately\n$41.4 million, offset by accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately $45.6 million. We reported net income of approximately $2.4 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nOn December 31, 2023, we had negative working capital of approximately $(8.8) million, which included cash and cash equivalents and other current assets of approximately\n$37.3 million, offset by accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately $46.0 million. We reported net income of approximately $1.5 million during the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nFor each of the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, approximately 99.9% of our total transaction volume was attributable to transactions in Bitcoin and, as\nof the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, transactions in Bitcoin account for 100% of our transaction volumes. We purchase Bitcoin through liquidity providers on a\njust-in-time basis based on expected transaction volumes in order to maintain a balance at a specified amount. Our ability to dynamically rebalance the levels of Bitcoin we hold\nat any given time based on transaction volumes and the market price of Bitcoin means that there are limited working capital requirements related to our Bitcoin management\nactivities. There are two main components of the working capital required in our operations. We maintain Bitcoin (currently in an amount which, at any given time, is typically\nless than $0.6 million) in our hot wallets to fulfill orders from users while we are automatically placing orders with liquidity providers and exchanges to replenish the Bitcoin we\nhave sold to users. The second component of working capital is cash and cash equivalents generated from sales at our BTM kiosks. As users insert cash into the BTM kiosks,\ncash accumulates until armored carriers collect the cash and process it back to our bank accounts. While not required, we typically maintain a variable level of cash in the BTM\nkiosks at all times. As of September\n-50-\nTable of Contents\n30, 2024, cash in the BTM kiosks was approximately 24.2% of average monthly revenues for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts\nand the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to purchase additional kiosks and invest in the expansion of our products and services. We may in the future enter\ninto arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional\nequity or debt financing. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional\ncapital when desired, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\n(cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:12)\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company announced that its Board has authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to\n$10.0 million of outstanding shares of its Class A common stock beginning immediately and continuing through and including September 30, 2024. The Company made an\naccounting policy election to measure the fair value of purchases or sales of securities, including purchases of its own shares as part of the share repurchase program, as of the\ntrade date. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 69,976 shares at a total cost of $0.2 million with an average cost per share of $2.26. No\nshares were repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024. From the date of authorization through September 30, 2024, 190,620 shares of the Company's\nClass A common stock had been repurchased with a total cost of $0.4 million. The program was not renewed upon expiration.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nWe define Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and depreciation and amortization\nadjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our\nresults of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included Adjusted Gross Profit in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measurement used internally by management to measure the efficiency of our business. This non-GAAP financial\nmeasure should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations\nby relying primarily on U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Our computation of Adjusted Gross Profit may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate this measure in the same fashion. You should review the reconciliation of Gross\nProfit to Adjusted Gross Profit below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of revenue to Adjusted Gross Profit for the periods indicated (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 135,271 $ 179,483 $ 436,876 $ 540,561\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) (112,853) (152,545) $ (370,848) (461,087)\nDepreciation and amortization excluded from cost of revenue (2,233) (3,260) (8,090) (9,554)\nGross Profit $ 20,185 $ 23,678 $ 57,938 $ 69,920\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization excluded from cost of revenue $ 2,233 $ 3,260 $ 8,090 $ 9,554\nAdjusted Gross Profit $ 22,418 $ 26,938 $ 66,028 $ 79,474\nGross Profit Margin (1) 14.9% 13.2% 13.3% 12.9%\nAdjusted Gross Profit Margin (1) 16.6% 15.0% 15.1% 14.7%\n(1)Calculated as a percentage of revenue.\n-51-\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income before interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses, PIPE\nrelated expenses, share-based compensation, and miscellaneous cost adjustments.\nThese items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by\ncore results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors\nand others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance.\nMoreover, we have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measurement used internally by management to make operating\ndecisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial planning. However, you should be aware that when\nevaluating Adjusted EBITDA, we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. The presentation of this measure should not be\nconstrued as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Further, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in\nisolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on U.S. GAAP\nresults and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by\nother companies because not all companies calculate this measure in the same fashion.

Under the Amended and Restated Note,\nthe Company refinanced $20.8 million of the note which is subject to an annual interest at a rate of 17% per annum. The Company is required to make monthly interest\npayments and fixed principal payments every six months beginning on December 15, 2023 through June 15, 2026. In connection with the Amended and Restated Note, the\nCompany repaid approximately $16.4 million of the outstanding principal balance, refinanced $20.8 million of the outstanding principal balance and paid an exit fee of $2.3\nmillion. The Amended and Restated Note matures on June 23, 2026, at which time, any\n-52-\nTable of Contents\noutstanding principal balance and any accrued interest become due. Additionally, the Company is required to pay an exit fee of $1.8 million upon maturity or prepayment and\naccordingly, has included this amount in the note payable, non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In conjunction with the transaction, Legacy Bitcoin Depot and BT\nAssets, Inc. were substituted for BT OpCo and BT HoldCo, LLC respectively. The Amended and Restated Note is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of BT HoldCo,\nLLC and Mintz Assets, Inc., Express Vending, Inc., Intuitive Software, LLC, Digital Gold Ventures, Inc. and BitAccess Inc. The Company is subject to certain financial\ncovenants contained in the Amended and Restated Note, which require BT HoldCo and certain of its subsidiaries to maintain certain cash balances, and a maximum\nconsolidated total leverage ratio, in addition to customary administrative covenants. The Company accounted for the Amended and Restated Note as a debt modification in\naccordance with ASC 470, (cid:0)* (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:7).\nOn March 26, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Note dated June 23, 2023 to provide an additional $15.7 million in principal\nfinancing. This amendment increased the aggregate principal amount of the term loan facility to $35.6 million which consists of $19.9 million outstanding on the original loan\nand $15.7 million in additional principal resulting in net cash flow of $15.2 million related to the amendment. The Company accounted for the amended and restated note as an\nextinguishment of debt in accordance with ASC 470, (cid:0)* (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:7). As such, the Company recognized the outstanding deferred financing costs of $3.2 million as a loss on\nextinguishment of debt in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income which consisted of a $2.7 million write off\nunamortized deferred loan costs and $0.5 million in loan origination fees related to the amendment.\n(cid:0)/ (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)2 (cid:0)(cid:9)(cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:23)\nOn June 23, 2023, GSRM entered into a private placement agreement with certain subscribers (“Subscribers”). For purposes of settlement under the PIPE Agreement, the\nnotional amount of 5,000,000 shares consisted of (a) the 4,300,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock sold at the closing of the Merger, and (b) 700,000 shares of Class A\ncommon stock that were held by the Subscribers prior to the consummation of the Transaction. In connection with the Transaction, the Subscribers entered into non-redemption\nagreements with the Company and received additional shares of Class A common stock in exchange for their commitments not to redeem.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The exposure to these risks is managed\nthrough normal operating and financing activities.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWith the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on their evaluation, the Company’s principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide\nreasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the\nCompany’s management, including its Chief\n-55-\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, solely as a result of the material weaknesses in our\ninternal control over financial reporting below.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nIn connection with the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses in its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. The material weaknesses had not been remediated as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of\ndeficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not\nbe prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified related to (i) the fact that the Company did not have formalized system of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting in place to ensure that risks are properly assessed, controls are properly designed and implemented and internal controls are properly monitored\nand functioning, (ii) the Company’s reliance on IT systems and the use of service organizations to initiate, process, and record transactions, for which it did not evaluate or test\nthe respective control objectives and data provided by the service organizations, and did not maintain a sufficient complement of formally documented general IT controls over\naccess, segregation of duties, security, and change management, (iii) the Company’s lack of technical accounting resources to analyze and apply technical accounting\nconsiderations, (iv) the Company having insufficient controls in place to prevent potential unauthorized activity related to cryptocurrencies, and (v) ineffective reconciliation\ncontrols over cash in transit. Management has concluded that these material weaknesses arose because, as a private company (prior to the closing of the Merger), the Company\ndid not have the necessary business processes, personnel and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public\ncompany.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud, and material weaknesses could limit the ability to prevent or detect a\nmisstatement of accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements. To address the material weaknesses, the Company\nwill need to add personnel as well as implement additional financial reporting processes and related internal controls. Management intends to continue to take steps to remediate\nthe material weaknesses described above through hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel, further enhancing their accounting processes and risk\nassessment, and by designing, implementing and monitoring the respective controls. Management will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps\nhave been completed and the controls have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there\nis no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects or that the actions that management may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the\ncontrol deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or detect potential future material weaknesses. The\nCompany’s current controls and any new controls that management develops may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in the business and weaknesses in\ndisclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties\nencountered in their implementation or improvement could harm the operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet the reporting obligations and may result in a\nrestatement of the Company’s financial statements for prior periods.\nAny failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual\nindependent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting required to be included in Bitcoin\nDepot’s periodic reports that are filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose\nconfidence in Bitcoin Depot’s reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of the Class A common stock. In\naddition, we would not be able to continue to be listed on Nasdaq, which could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of your investment.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n-56-\nTable of Contents\nPART II -\nOTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nOn January 13, 2023, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (“Canaccord”) commenced proceedings against the Company by filing a claim with the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto,\nOntario which named Lux Vending, LLC and Bitcoin Depot LLC as the defendants. Canaccord is a financial services firm in Canada that the Company previously had hired to\nperform advisory services related to a potential initial public offering or sales transaction. The claim asserts that Lux Vending, LLC breached the contract by terminating the\ncontract to avoid paying fees for their services and that Canaccord is entitled to approximately $22.3 million in damages equivalent to the fees alleged to be payable for breach\nof contract that would have been owed upon the closing of a transaction to acquire control, the sale of substantially all the Company’s assets, or a merger transaction pursuant to\nthe previously terminated engagement letter for advisory services. Canaccord proposes that the amount of fees would be calculated on the total transaction value of the business\ncombination that Canaccord now values at $655 million. The claim also seeks an award for legal and other costs relating to the proceeding. On October 25, 2023, Canaccord\namended their complaint to increase the amount of the claim by $0.7 million to roughly $23 million and to add Bitcoin Depot Operating LLC as a defendant to account for the\nname change following the closing of the merger. The increase in the claim is the result of Canaccord changing the estimated transaction value from $615 to $655 million.\nBitcoin Depot does not believe the allegations made against it are valid and intends to vigorously defend against them. The range of potential loss related to the identified claim\nis between $0 and $23.0 million, the amount of damages that Canaccord is seeking in the lawsuit. The additional costs mentioned in the claim are not able to be estimated at this\ntime. The discovery phase of the litigation involving documentary productions and oral examinations is largely completed. A mediation of the dispute will be held at the end of\nfourth quarter of 2024.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business. We believe these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nFor a complete discussion of the Company’s risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023.\nIf the following risk occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the market price of our\nclass A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n•Further reductions in mining rewards of Bitcoin, including due to block reward halving events, which are events that occur after a specific period of time (the most recent\nof which occurred on April 19, 2024) that reduce the block reward earned by “miners” who validate Bitcoin transactions, or increases in the costs associated with Bitcoin\nmining, including increases in electricity costs and hardware and software used in mining, or new or enhanced regulation or taxation of Bitcoin mining, which could\nfurther increase the costs associated with Bitcoin mining, any of which may cause a decline in support for the Bitcoin network.\nItem 2.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or the Company's future financial or operating performance, including pro forma and estimated financial information, and other \"forward-looking\nstatements\" (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). The recipient can identify forward-looking statements because they typically contain words such as \"outlook,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\"\n\"will,\" \"projected,\" \"continue,\" \"increase,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"seeks,\" \"predicts,\" \"intends,\" \"trends,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates,\" \"anticipates\" or the negatives or variations of these words or other comparable words and/or\nsimilar expressions (but the absence of these words and/orsimilar expressions does not mean thatastatement is not forward-looking).

Forward-looking statements, opinions and projections are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on the\nCompany's currentbeliefs, expectations andassumptions regarding the future ofits business,future plans andstrategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and otherfuture conditions. Because forward-\nlooking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. These uncertainties\nand risks may be known or unknown. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: changes in domestic and foreign business, financial, political and legal\nconditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination; risks relating to the uncertainty of the Company’s projected financial information; future global, regional or local economic and market\nconditions; the development, effects and enforcement of laws and regulations; the financial performance of the Company following the Business Combination; the Company’s ability to manage future growth; the Company’s\nability to develop new products and services, bring them to market in a timely manner, and make enhancements to its business; the effects of competition on the Company’s future business; the ability of the Company to\nissue equity or equity-linked securities, to obtain debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness onsatisfactory terms, orotherwise raise financing in the future; the Company’s public securities liquidity and trading; market\nadoption and future performanceof cryptocurrencies; the outcome of any potential litigation, governmentand regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries; and those factors described or referenced in the Company’s\nForm10-K, filed onApril15, 2024,underthe heading \"Risk Factors,\"and otherdocuments ofthe Company filed, orto befiled, fromtime to time withthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Ifany oftheserisks\nmaterialize or the Company's assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect the\nCompany's expectations and views as of the date of this presentation. The Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its assessments to change. However, while the Company may elect to\nupdate these forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, except as may be required by applicable law. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking\nstatements,whichspeakonly asof thedatetheyaremade.\n2\nDisclaimer\nNon-GAAP Measures: This presentation includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") including, but not limited to, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,\nAdjusted Gross Profit and certain ratios and other metrics derived therefrom. The Company defines (i) EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA\nfurtheradjusted bythe removalofcertainnon-recurring costsand assumed public companycosts. The Company defines Adjusted Gross Profit as revenue less costof revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization). These\nnon-GAAP financial measures are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing the Company's financial results. Such measures\nmay not be indicative of the Company's historical operating results nor are such measures meant to be predictive of future results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net\nincome, cashflows fromoperations orothermeasures ofprofitability, liquidity orperformance underGAAP. Youshould beaware thatthe Company's presentation ofthese measures maynotbecomparable tosimilarly-titled\nmeasuresusedbyothercompanies.Assuch,unduerelianceshouldnotbeplacedonthesenon-GAAPfinancialmeasures.\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and\nresults of operations. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in and in comparing the\nCompany's financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the\nexercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to footnotes where presented on each page of this\npresentation and/or to the appendix found at the end of this presentation for more details regarding the calculations of such measures and/or for a reconciliation of these measures to what the Company believes are the\nmostdirectly comparablemeasuresevaluatedinaccordancewithGAAP.\nTrademarks and Trade Names: The Company owns or has rights to various trademarks, service marks and trade names that they use in connection with the operation of their respective businesses.

Our forward-looking statements\ninclude, but are not limited to, statements regarding our and our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any\nstatements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.\nThe words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,”\n“would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These\nforward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a\nprediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual\nevents and circumstances are beyond the control of Bitcoin Depot Inc. (the “Company” or “Bitcoin Depot”). Some risks of achieving any of these forward-looking statements\ninclude:\n•failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger;\n•the ability to maintain the listing of the Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \"Class A common stock\"), and the warrants to purchase the Class A\ncommon stock (the \"Warrants\") on Nasdaq;\n•the Company’s ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, to obtain debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness on satisfactory terms, or otherwise raise\nfinancing in the future;\n•the liquidity and trading of the Class A common stock and the Warrants;\n•members of the Company’s management team allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with the Company’s business;\n•the Company’s future financial performance;\n•the Company’s success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, its officers, key employees or directors;\n•the Company’s ability to manage future growth;\n•the Company’s ability to develop new products and services, bring them to market in a timely manner, and make enhancements to its business;\n•the effects of competition on the Company’s business;\n•market adoption and future performance of cryptocurrencies;\n•changes in domestic and foreign business, financial, political and legal conditions;\n•future global, regional or local economic and market conditions;\n•the outcome of any potential litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries;\n•the development, effects and enforcement of laws and regulations; and\n•other risks noted in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” and other documents that the Company will file, from time to time with the\nSecurities Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nIf any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There\nmay be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the\nforward-looking statements.\nIn addition, forward-looking statements reflect our expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date hereof. We anticipate that subsequent events and\ndevelopments will cause our assessments to change. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by\napplicable law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our assessment as of any date subsequent to the date hereof.\nThese statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and\nuncertainties, actual results or our performance of the Company may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n3\nTable of Contents\nYou should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents that we reference in and have filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K completely and with\nthe understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary\nstatements.\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOur Business\nBusiness Overview\nBitcoin Depot owns and operates the largest network of BTMs (or, \"kiosks\") across North America where customers can buy and sell Bitcoin. Bitcoin Depot helps power the\ndigital economy for users of cash.\nOur mission is to bring Crypto to the Masses TM. Digital means and systems dominate the way that consumers send money, make purchases, and invest; however, we believe that\nmany people still utilize cash as their primary means of initiating a transaction, either as a necessity or as a preference. These individuals have largely been excluded from the\ndigital financial system and associated technological advancements in our global and digitally interconnected society. Bitcoin Depot’s simple and convenient process to convert\ncash into Bitcoin via our BTMs and full-service mobile app enables not only these users, but also the broader public, to access the digital financial system.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our offerings included approximately 6,300 BTMs in retailer locations throughout the U.S. and Canada, our BDCheckout product, which is accepted\nat approximately 5,700 retail locations, and our mobile app. We maintain the leading position among cash-to-Bitcoin BTM operators in the U.S., representing an approximate\n23% market share in the U.S., and a leading position in Canada. Our BTMs offer one-way exchange of cash-to-Bitcoin, with the limited exception of approximately 29 BTMs\n(representing less than 1% of our total kiosks as of December 31, 2023) which also provide customers the ability to sell Bitcoin to us in exchange for cash. Currently, we do not\nhave plans to expand our users’ ability to sell Bitcoin to us in exchange for cash. We also operate a leading BTM device and transaction processing system, BitAccess, which\nprovides software and operational capabilities to third-party BTM operators, which generates software revenue for the Company.\nThe charts below illustrate the number of BTMs and corresponding market shares for the leading BTM operators in the U.S. and Canada, as of December 31, 2023: (Note data\nis delayed from our actual active kiosks, please see Section 7, Management discussion and analysis for additional information regarding kiosk information.)\n4\nTable of Contents\n(1) Source: Coinatmradar.com as of December 31, 2023. Figures only account for cash-to-Bitcoin ATMs, which results in the exclusion of LibertyX.\n5\nTable of Contents\nOur diverse retail locations and intuitive transaction process make us a convenient option for our users, and our predictable minimum monthly rent payments to our retail\npartners where our kiosks are located make us an attractive option for these retailers. We have locations across the U.S. and Canada at, among others, the following type of\nretailers:\n•Convenience Stores and Gas Station Chains: Our largest BTM deployment to date is with Circle K, a convenience store chain with over 9,000 locations in North\nAmerica and over 4,800 stores in Europe and other international markets. We are the exclusive provider and operator of BTMs for Circle K in the U.S. and Canada, and as\nof December 31, 2023, we have installed our BTMs in approximately 1,300 Circle K stores.\n•Pharmacies and Grocers: In addition to our installed BTMs at pharmacy and grocery chains, we have thousands of additional access points via our BDCheckout\nproduct. Our BDCheckout locations are sourced and connected through our relationship with a leading global payments technology company. See \"Our Products\".\n•Mall Operators: Further, we have installed our BTMs at shopping malls across North America, including those operated by Simon Property Group, CBL Properties and\nothers.\nThe following map illustrates the number of BTMs we operate by U.S. state and Canadian province as of March 11, 2024:\nBoth our revenue and transaction volumes have historically grown despite volatility in market prices for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and we expect this trend to continue\nas Bitcoin becomes increasingly accepted across the world.\nOur focus on robust compliance procedures and ease of use of our BTMs has helped create a powerful compounding effect: the convenience and quality of our platform\nprovides a seamless experience for users transacting at our BTMs; thereby driving increased traffic and business at our retail partners; attracting more retailers to partner with\nus; and in turn driving even more users to our BTMs. Our scale and leadership position has enabled us to develop a deeper understanding of our users’ needs and continually\ninnovate and launch new products and services, such as BDCheckout, further enhancing the value of our platform.\n6\nTable of Contents\nFrom our inception in July 2016 through December 31, 2023, we have completed more than 3.3 million user transactions, equating to approximately $2.3 billion in total\ntransaction value. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we averaged approximately 21,824 monthly active users, which we define as the total number of unique\ncustomers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated approximately $689.0 million of revenue, $88.6 million of gross profit (12.9% of gross profit margin), $1.5\nmillion of net income and $56.3 million in Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), which represented 14.7% of Adjusted Gross Profit Margin (non-GAAP) for the same period. For\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately $646.8 million of revenue, $53.5 million of gross profit (8.3% of gross profit margin), $3.5 million of net\nincome and $41.2 million in Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), which represented 11.2% of Adjusted Gross Profit Margin (non-GAAP) for the same period. See the sections\ntitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations—Non- GAAP Financial Measures” for information regarding our use of Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nGross Profit and a reconciliation of such measures.\nOur Products\nAs of December 31, 2023, we operated a portfolio of approximately 6,300 owned and leased kiosks across 48 U.S. states and 10 Canadian provinces. Within the United States,\nour kiosks and BDCheckout access points are located in zip codes containing approximately 52% of the U.S. population. While we are currently not operating kiosks in New\nYork or Puerto Rico, we have obtained a license (or equivalent) to operate in Puerto Rico and have applied for the license required to operate in New York. See “—Government\nRegulation—Money transmission and virtual currency business activity” for more information.\nBTM\nOur kiosks are located in convenience stores, gas stations, pharmacies, grocery chains and shopping malls across North America. Our largest deployment across a single retail\nchain is with Circle K, which accounted for approximately 1,300 of our total number of deployed kiosks as of December 31, 2023. We continuously monitor our BTM\nperformance at each location, and at various times we relocate our BTMs to more profitable locations. The majority of our contracts contractually, allow us to move our BTMs\nwith a limited notification to our retail partners. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 900 BTMs with our logistics providers to redeploy to new locations.\nOur kiosks are primarily manufactured and supplied by Genmega, a leading global ATM company. Our BTM suppliers load the operating software on to the kiosks prior to\ndeployment. Because utilization is below that of typical cash ATMs, we believe that that the functional life of our kiosks is extended relative to manufacturer specifications. We\nhave contracted with a network of providers to service our kiosks on an as-needed basis to support kiosk up-time, but our kiosks have typically not required frequent repair or\nmaintenance.\nWe have found that a key factor affecting transaction volumes at any particular kiosk is its location. Our strategy in deploying our BTMs is to identify locations that are\nexpected to generate high visibility and high transaction volume. Site selection for kiosk deployment is also determined based on an analysis of historical business trends,\ndemographic data, and a determination of the proximity and density of competitors’ kiosks. The approximately 1,300 kiosks deployed at Circle K stores are a prime example of\nthe types of locations that we seek when deploying our BTMs. In addition to the Circle K locations, we have also entered into agreements with a number of other retail partners.\nOur retail deployments are secured through negotiation with our retail partners. Contract terms are generally similar across the portfolio of retail partners, such as payment\nterms, service level agreements, rent, placement, and access. These contracts provide a recurring and stable source of revenue for our retail partners over a typical initial term of\napproximately five years, although our terms vary because of negotiations at the time of execution. As of December 31, 2023, our contracts with our top 10 retail partners had a\nweighted average remaining life of 1.7 years. Many of our contracts include auto-renewal features providing for additional one-year terms following the expiration of the initial\nterm. Such contracts may be terminated at either party’s option by giving proper notice in accordance with the subject contract. All contracts with over a 12-month term allow\nfor kiosks to be removed at our discretion, except in one agreement. This agreement is associated with 25 BTMs, which has restrictions on the first nine months of the kiosk\nplacement. The Company has recognized a floor space lease associated with these BTMs. This overall flexibility to move our BTMs allows us to not record a liability on the\nbalance sheet related to these retail location leases.\nThe software that resides on the kiosk is designed to provide an intuitive user interface for our users. Upon using a Bitcoin Depot kiosk for the first time, users will be prompted\nto provide certain information for account creation and verification. Users are required to select from three ranges of cash amounts to be inserted in the kiosk for purchasing\nBitcoin. The user then provides the address of their digital wallet by scanning a QR code; the user can create and use a Bitcoin Depot-branded wallet (un-hosted and non-\ncustodial), or their other existing digital wallet. Bitcoin Depot’s branded wallet is facilitated through an unaffiliated third party. Bitcoin Depot\n7\nTable of Contents\nutilizes this wallet infrastructure to offer users the ability to use an un-hosted non-custodial wallet within the Bitcoin Depot mobile app or through other third-party apps which\nallow access to non-custodial wallets. Bitcoin Depot is not liable for any losses users may experience because Bitcoin Depot does not have access to users’ wallets or their\nprivate keys. Cash is then inserted by the user into the kiosk, and the kiosk will confirm the dollar amount and other details of the transaction, including quantity of Bitcoin\nbeing purchased. Once the transaction is complete, the Bitcoin is electronically delivered to the user’s digital wallet and the user is provided with a physical receipt as well as a\nreceipt via SMS text.\nPrior to the time at which a user inserts cash in the BTM to purchase Bitcoin, Bitcoin Depot has control of such Bitcoin, and maintains such control until the transaction is\ncompleted at the kiosk and Bitcoin Depot initiates a transaction on the blockchain to send Bitcoin to the user. Bitcoin Depot never custodies a user’s Bitcoin. Bitcoin Depot\ntakes custody of the user’s cash at the time the same is inserted into the BTM.\nBDCheckout\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Depot sells Bitcoin without the use of kiosks at several thousand additional retailer locations through a relationship with a leading global payments\ntechnology company. This product, called BDCheckout, allows users similar functionality to our kiosks, enabling them to load cash into their accounts at the checkout counter\nat retailer locations, and then use those funds to purchase Bitcoin. The transaction is initiated on the Bitcoin Depot mobile app, which is available for download from major app\nstores for free. We believe that BDCheckout offers an attractive value proposition for retailers, providing fee income and potentially increasing shopper foot traffic, without\nBitcoin Depot incurring upfront out-of-pocket hardware costs and certain operational expenses, such as rent.\nThe primary difference between a BDCheckout transaction and a BTM kiosk transaction is that the former is completed via interaction with a cashier at a retail location and\nrelies more heavily on the use of the Bitcoin Depot mobile app, while the latter involves a user interfacing with a kiosk. From a third-party fee perspective, there is a $3.50 flat\nfee per BDCheckout transaction charged to the user in connection with the use of payment provider integrated network of retailers’ point-of-sale systems.\nBitcoin Depot’s costs associated with a BDCheckout transaction are lower than its costs associated with a BTM transaction, primarily due to significantly greater operating\nexpenses associated with the BTMs, including cash collection fees and short-term lease payments to the retail locations where the kiosks are placed. However, the profitability\nof the two services is similar because of the higher markup that Bitcoin Depot applies to BTM transactions to support the higher costs associated therewith.\nWe regularly monitor official SEC releases and comments made by senior SEC officials, including Chairman Gensler, regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies and related\nactivities. Based on such statements, historical enforcement actions and existing regulations and laws, we have made the determination that our activities and the\ncryptocurrencies that we currently sell, which consists of only Bitcoin, do not subject us to SEC regulation, and thus we believe we are not required to be registered with the\nSEC as a broker dealer to support transactions which consist of only Bitcoin at our BTMs and via BDCheckout. We note that we have previously provided products and services\nrelated to Litecoin and Ethereum, however, based on a risk-based determination made after consideration of public statements by the SEC, historical enforcement actions, and\nexisting regulations and laws in effect at the time, we have determined to limit our activities to Bitcoin only.\nIndustry Trends\nThe adoption of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange has grown significantly since Bitcoin’s introduction in 2009 and cryptocurrency is continuing to become more\nmainstream among consumers. In 2023, centralized and decentralized exchanges reported nearly $82.0 trillion, in cryptocurrency trading volume, a 6.5% decrease from 2022\nlevels. According to New York Digital Investment Group LLC d/b/a NYDIG, Bitcoin alone was the third largest payment network in 2022 with over $3.0 trillion in transaction\nvolume, next only to Visa and Mastercard and ahead of American Express and Discover, and an estimated 22% of the U.S. adult population owns cryptocurrency.\nSeveral notable developments have contributed to this growth, including broader acceptance of cryptocurrency on payment platforms, the proliferation of financial products\noffering investors exposure to cryptocurrencies, and market participants looking for ways to simplify transactions for the everyday consumer.\nAt the same time, consumers have become attracted to the accessibility and user experience of BTMs as an entry ramp into the digital financial system. Several companies\nbegan to work on BTM prototypes as early as 2013, and the BTM market has shown rapid growth since then. According to Coin ATM Radar, from January 1, 2017 to\nDecember 31, 2023, the total number of BTMs deployed grew from 968 to 33,936, representing a CAGR of approximately 84%, with the vast majority of BTMs now located in\nNorth\n8\nTable of Contents\nAmerica. According to Coin ATM Radar, as of December 31, 2023, 90% of installed BTMs worldwide reside in the U.S. and Canada, in which Bitcoin Depot had a market\nshare of 23% and 11%, respectively. Many BTMs deployed around the world initially supported transacting only in Bitcoin. Our BTMs currently support transactions in Bitcoin.\nMarket Opportunity\nAlthough U.S. consumers continued to use credit cards and debit cards for a majority of their payments, market studies indicate there is still a significant desire to utilize cash\nfor various purposes in the U.S. The 2023 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice, a study conducted by Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that while it has declined\nover time, the share of payments in cash was 18% in 2022, which was a decrease from the data in 2021. As of October 2022, the value of currency in circulation passed $2.23\ntrillion, a 28% increase compared to February 2020, but with slower growth since 2021. In addition, according to a study by Travis Credit Union conducted in 2020, 29% of\nU.S. adults sampled prefer to use cash to purchase goods. We believe a portion of this population finds obtaining cryptocurrencies through online cryptocurrency exchanges\nchallenging and inconvenient and prefers to directly convert their cash to cryptocurrencies. The chart below shows the proportions of various methods of payments since 2016.\nThe 2023 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice also shows that a significant percentage of person-to-person payments continue to be made in cash, and credit cards, the\npercentage of these payments made with credit cards has been steadily increasing compared to the prior years. According to a user survey we conducted, many of our users\nreport that the reason they used our BTMs was to send cryptocurrency to others. This use case can represent a more efficient means of sending money for those who are using\ncash to make person-to-person payments, or an alternative means of sending money for those who are using mobile apps.\nShare of payment instrument use for all payments (1)\n(1) Source: 2023 Findings from the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice;\nFor the most up-to-date figures please consult the links in the section titled “Market, Industry and Other Data.”\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe the below competitive strengths differentiate us from our competition and enhance our ability to compete.\n•Largest BTM Operator in North America\nWe are the largest operator of BTMs in North America with an approximately 23% market share as of December 31, 2023, according to Coin ATM Radar. As of December 31,\n2023, we have approximately 6,300 active kiosks across 48 states in the U.S. and 10\n9\nTable of Contents\nprovinces in Canada across convenience stores, gas stations, pharmacies, grocery chains and shopping malls. Bitcoin Depot’s strategically placed network of BTMs and\nBDCheckout access points are located in zip codes addressing approximately 52% of the U.S. population. Our strong presence has given us increased visibility among users and\nretail partners and has helped drive user traffic to our kiosks.\n•Superior User and Retailer Experience\nIn addition to offering intuitive user interfaces at our BTMs for transactions, we believe we offer a streamlined alternative to online exchanges for transacting in Bitcoin. Online\nexchanges can in certain instances require users to wait over three business days to convert money to Bitcoin, and they also require a user to have a bank account and therefore\nprovide no cash conversion options. Our users can purchase Bitcoin without a bank account through our kiosks in typically under two minutes for new accounts and in under a\nminute for returning users. Our streamlined mobile app offers an easy way for our users to locate points-of-transaction, create a digital wallet, transfer Bitcoin between digital\nwallets and initiate BDCheckout transactions. We provide telephonic customer service almost around the clock to address questions or concerns from our users and to facilitate\na smooth transaction process.\nWe have flexible hosting contract terms with our retail partners that offer location payments tied to a predictable minimum rate monthly rent (which, for certain locations, may\nbe increased based on transaction volumes, thereby aligning partners’ success with our own performance). Based on our observations, our kiosks provide the benefit of driving\nadditional foot traffic at retail locations, which as a result potentially drives additional business to our partners, thereby increasing their revenue.\n•Robust Compliance Procedures\nWe complete our customer KYC process prior to permitting a user to transact. We have invested in and maintain robust, multi-layer compliance procedures to evaluate potential\nusers, open user accounts and monitor transactions at our BTMs. Our compliance team, comprised of 16 individuals, has over 100 years of combined experience in AML (Anti-\nMoney Laundering), KYC (Know-Your-Customer), BSA (Bank Secrecy Act), and OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) compliance. The level of user verification for any\ngiven user transacting at our kiosks is generally based on the user’s proposed transaction volume with us. Generally, verification involves collecting users’ names, email\naddresses, phone numbers, driver’s licenses or other ID, social security numbers and photos of each user. Further, our BTMs take photos throughout the transaction process,\nwhich allows us to verify that users match the identifying information that has been provided during the KYC process. We utilize blockchain analysis and work with various\nthird parties for transaction monitoring, case management and regulatory filings and reporting. We prioritize proactive reporting procedures in accordance with local, state, and\nfederal requirements. Our compliance team routinely rejects user applicants that fail authentication requirements, and bans users from transacting at our kiosks and via\nBDCheckout when our compliance team discovers suspicious activity or when the users violate our terms of service (which can be accessed on our website) to which users\nagree prior to transacting at a BTM or during the BDCheckout transaction process, as applicable. These user bans represent approximately 4% of our overall transaction\nvolumes in a given month. We do not believe there are any material challenges related to conducting KYC at a kiosk. We believe many of our retail partners have selected us to\nbe their BTM provider based on our focus and commitment to robust compliance.\n•Limited Exposure to Cryptocurrency Prices\nOur revenue has not been correlated to the price of Bitcoin historically, even in light of volatile Bitcoin prices. Based on our own user surveys, a majority of our users use our\nproducts and services for non-speculative purposes, including money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases, among others.\n•Prudent Bitcoin Management\nWe use a sophisticated Bitcoin management process to reduce our exposure to volatility in Bitcoin prices by maintaining a relatively low balance (typically less than $1 million)\nof Bitcoin at any given time, which we believe differentiates us from our competition. We do not act as an agent or exchange for users in our transactions; we maintain balances\nof Bitcoin from which we satisfy our users’ demand from kiosk or BDCheckout transactions. As we send users Bitcoin, we replenish our Bitcoin balance on an ongoing basis to\nmeet user demand. Our typical practice is to purchase Bitcoin through a liquidity provider such as Cumberland DRW. We replenish our Bitcoin only through purchases from\nleading Bitcoin liquidity providers and do not engage in any mining of Bitcoin ourselves. Our sophisticated replenishment process enables us to satisfy our users’ Bitcoin\npurchases with our own Bitcoin holdings, yet maintain relatively small balances of Bitcoin to effectively manage our principal risk.\n•Management Team With Deep Industry Experience\nWe are led by a management team that built our business from the ground up to become the largest operator of BTMs in North America. Our founder and other executive\nofficers bring extensive multidisciplinary experience in technology and business. We\n10\nTable of Contents\nbelieve our management team has a competitive advantage in their ability to attract a highly talented pool of experienced engineers and seasoned industry professionals. We\nbelieve our management team’s expertise in this industry enables them to pursue attractive and opportunistic acquisition targets to further strengthen our competitive advantage.\nOur Strategies\nWe intend to continue to grow our business by employing the following strategies:\n•Geographical and Retailer Expansion\nWe intend to continue to expand into more physical locations at our existing partners as well as build new partner relationships for further greenfield market penetration.\nAmong existing partners, our kiosks are located in approximately 1,300 out of the over 9,000 total Circle K locations in the U.S. and Canada. Our broad footprint and user base\npresents us an opportunity to offer additional products and services in the future, which we believe will further strengthen and grow our user base. To expand into new\ngeographies, we have applied for a license to operate in the state of New York, a market we believe could support thousands of kiosks, an estimate we adopted based on other\nstates with more established BTM networks and comparable populations, such as Florida. Finally, approximately 92% of BTMs worldwide are in North America, according to\nCoin ATM Radar as of March 26, 2024, presenting an attractive international expansion opportunity for us. Various countries have begun accepting cryptocurrency as a legal\nform of payment, which we believe is going to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency and offer us an opportunity to establish a presence in these countries.\n•Leverage Scale and Profitability to Reinvest in the Business\nWe operate the largest network of BTMs in North America. We have generated positive net income and cash flow from operations during every year since our inception. For\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated revenue of approximately $689.0 million and $646.8 million, respectively, gross profit of $88.6 million and $53.5\nmillion, respectively, and adjusted gross profit of $101.0 million and $72.3 million, respectively. We currently intend to reinvest the majority of the profits back in our business\nto continue to develop new products and services to address the needs of our users, such as BDCheckout, allowing us to achieve further brand recognition and brand loyalty and\ngrow our user base.\n•Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships\nWe believe the BTM market is fragmented. We plan to opportunistically evaluate acquiring other kiosk operators and complementary businesses to support our operations and\nstrategy. Provided we are able to secure appropriate opportunities, we intend to pursue inorganic growth in the form of strategic bolt-on acquisitions to build on our leading\nmarket position and to supplement our in-house capabilities in both hardware kiosks and software that run on these kiosks as well as any product or service that provides Bitcoin\naccess in a retail setting. In addition, we continue to look for potential acquisitions to enhance our capabilities in areas such as cyber security and compliance, among others.\n•Grow Volume of Retail Transactions Through BDCheckout\nWe launched BDCheckout in June 2022 and as of December 31, 2023, it is available at approximately 5,700 retail locations across North America, including convenience\nstores, gas stations, pharmacies, grocery chains and shopping malls. BDCheckout enables our users to load cash into their accounts at the checkout counter at retailer locations,\nand then use those funds to purchase Bitcoin using the same fee structure in place at our kiosks, thereby lowering our required upfront capital expenditures and operating\nexpenses and providing us with additional revenues from the sale of Bitcoin. For more information about how we generate our revenue, please see the section of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Components of Results of Operations—Revenue.”\nWe intend to fully capitalize on this by actively targeting our users with BDCheckout through online advertising and our free mobile app. We believe the expansion of\nBDCheckout to new locations across the U.S. and Canada will diversify our revenue streams as well as further grow our transaction volumes, revenue and profitability.\nRecent Highlights\nIn March 2023, we announced a partnership agreement with GetGo® Café + Market, an innovative, food-first convenience store retailer with locations throughout western\nPennsylvania, Ohio, northern West Virginia, Maryland and Indiana. We plan to install our BTMs into 125 GetGo® Café + Market stores in multiple metropolitan areas,\nstrengthening our presence throughout the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.\nIn September 2023, the Company entered into an On-Site Agreement, with Tanger Management, the property manager for the outlet centers located throughout the United\nStates and Canada. The agreement anticipates the placement of BTMs in 16 mall locations.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIn October 2023, we fostered a critical relationship, for the placement of our kiosks, with one of the foremost distributors in the ATM industry, CORD, underscoring our\nreputation as a formidable player in the market which has more than 3000+ ATMs in the US. We believe this partnership will expand our reach of connecting our BTMs with\nthose that wish to own or operate BTMs.\nIn December 2023, we announced a partnership with MAPCO for kiosk placement, which encompasses 63 of their corporate locations. With MAPCO's expansive network of\nover 145+ locations spanning six states, this collaboration presents an opportunity to bolster our market presence and engage with a wider audience. Initially commencing with\ntheir corporate sites, we have laid a robust foundation for additional expansion. Furthermore, we have a strategic alliance with Majors Management that carries the potential to\nextend our reach to an additional 570+ franchisee locations, and 200+ corporate locations. This strategic alliance holds immense promise for expanding our market positions.\nEntering January 2024, we signed a master placement agreement with EG America LLC, in one of the largest retail partner deals in the Company's history. With this\nagreement, we are set to install our BTMs in approximately 900+ locations, a significant leap forward in our expansion trajectory.\nIn February 2024, we were able to secure a deal with CEFCO for 72 out of their 200+ locations which marks a significant milestone for our company. This partnership not only\nexpands our market reach but also diversifies us within the convenience store industry. By aligning with CEFCO, a reputable and rapidly growing chain, we gain access to a\nbroader customer base and increase brand visibility.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry with an increasing number of participants. Industries adjacent to the digital financial system are highly fragmented, quickly\nevolving, intensely competitive, and subject to growing global regulatory scrutiny and oversight.\nThere are several publicly traded companies that operate cash to Bitcoin ATMs, including Athena Bitcoin Inc. and Bitcoin Well Inc. We believe we do not have any direct,\npure-play competitors, traded on major exchanges, who operate cash to Bitcoin ATMs at scale.\nSeveral private companies and wholly-owned subsidiaries of other publicly traded companies may be considered to be our competitors, including BitNational, Bitstop, Byte\nFederal, Inc., Cash2Bitcoin.com, Coin Hub, Coin Flip Bitcoin ATMs, Coinme, Instacoin, Moon Inc., dba LibertyX, a division of NCR Atleos Corporation, Localcoin,\nNationalBitcoin ATM, and RockItCoin, among others.\nSeparately, given our mission to Bring Bitcoin to the Masses™ by enabling our users to transact on everyday activities using Bitcoin, from paying bills to sending money\ntransfers to a variety of other use cases, other established payment processing and money transfer businesses may become our competitors, including PayPal, Block, Global\nPayments, Coinbase, Jack Henry, and MoneyGram, among others.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales team focuses principally on maintaining relationships with our existing retail partners and developing new relationships with national, regional and local retailers. The\nteam is organized into groups that specialize in marketing to specific retail industry segments, which allows us to tailor our offering to the specific requirements of each retail\npartner. As of December 31, 2023, our sales and marketing teams consisted of 28 employees. Those who are exclusively focused on sales typically receive a combination of\nbase salary and an incentive-based compensation.\nIn addition to targeting new business opportunities, our sales team supports our business initiatives by building and maintaining relationships with new retail partners. We seek\nto identify growth opportunities within each account by analyzing the retailer’s sales at each of its locations, foot traffic, and various demographic data to determine the best\nopportunities for new BTM placements.\nOur marketing team is focused on attracting users to our BTMs as well as to our BDCheckout retail locations. Our marketing team primarily uses digital marketing tools, such\nas Google AdWords, to acquire and retain users but also deploys email, SEO, and physical marketing presences as applicable. Our marketing team also supports the sales team\nin attracting new retail partners.\nIntellectual Property, Patents and Trademarks\n12\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we believe our success depends upon our technical and marketing expertise more than our proprietary rights, our future success and ability to compete depend in part\nupon our proprietary technology. We have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks. Most of our technology is not patented. Instead, we rely on a combination\nof contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, third-party contractors, and retail partners. Access to, and distribution of, our source code is restricted, and the disclosure and use of other proprietary\ninformation is further limited. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain, or use our products or\ntechnology. We cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not\nindependently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology in a manner that would avoid our intellectual property rights.\nResearch and Development\nWe invest in ongoing research to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure\nregulatory compliance. Product-specific enhancements are largely user-driven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through survey results, strategic initiatives\nmeetings and ongoing user contact. We also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products, services and enhancements\nto our users and reduce related costs. For instance, our research and development capabilities and efforts resulted in the successful launch and deployment of BDCheckout,\nrecently at thousands of major retailers. Associated costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and\nComprehensive Income (Loss) and are not material.\nOur Retail Partners\nIn the U.S., we have contracts with approximately 56 major national and regional retailers, including convenience stores, supermarkets, drug stores, and other high-traffic retail\nchains, which represent approximately 2,200 BTMs. We also have BTMs in approximately 3,900 independent retail locations in the U.S. In Canada, we have contracts with one\nnational merchant and approximately 100 independent merchants. Circle K is the largest retailer in our portfolio, representing approximately 27% and 32% of our total revenues\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The underlying retail agreement with Circle K has an initial term of five years. As of December 31, 2023, our\ncontracts with Circle K have a weighted average remaining life of 1.5 years. Our other top ten retail partners (excluding Circle K) comprise 7.4% of our retail locations.\nContracts with these nine other nine retail partners have a weighted average remaining life of 1.9 years as of December 31, 2023. Many of our contracts include auto-renewal\nfeatures providing for additional one-year terms following the expiration of the initial term. Such contracts may be terminated at either party’s option by giving proper notice in\naccordance with the subject contract. The terms of our retail partner contracts vary because of negotiations at the time of execution. In addition, through BDCheckout, our users\ncan now load cash into their accounts at the checkout counter at approximately 5,700 retailer locations, and then use those funds to purchase Bitcoin.\nOur Vendors/Suppliers\nCumberland DRW\nCumberland DRW (\"Cumberland\") is one of our co-primary liquidity providers from whom we purchase Bitcoin that we sell to our users. We have had a relationship with\nCumberland for over three years. Cumberland is a leading OTC liquidity provider in the digital financial system. The company has operations globally and is owned by DRW, a\ndiversified principal trading firm with more than 25 years of experience in multiple asset classes around the world.\nAbra\nAbra is one of our co-primary liquidity providers from whom we purchase Bitcoin that we sell to our users. We have had a relationship with Abra for almost one year. Abra is a\nfinancial services and technology company that operates a cryptocurrency wallet service including a trading service for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and a service for\nearning interest on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.\nGenmega\nGenmega is a global provider of kiosks and traditional cash ATMs and is currently the sole provider of our BTM kiosks. The company was founded over ten years ago and has\ncumulatively delivered more than 150,000 ATMs worldwide. Since 2016, Genmega has supplied more than 7,200 kiosks to us.\n13\nTable of Contents\nGemini\nGemini is an American cryptocurrency exchange and custodian that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets. To place orders for Bitcoin on the Gemini exchange,\nwe are required to have USD on account and available which facilitates the purchasing process. We maintain a minimum USD balance needed for anticipated Bitcoin purchases\nfor the day. We replenish the account with USD as needed. Gemini is the sole cryptocurrency exchange with which we hold USD balances. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, our average daily USD balance held in fiat wallets on the Gemini exchange was approximately $0.5 million.\nCash Transportation\nWe contract with large and reputable armored courier services to transport and transfer funds to and from our kiosks. We use leading armored couriers such as Loomis, Brinks\nand Garda in the U.S. and Canada to collect and transport cash. Under these arrangements, the armored couriers collect cash either on a regular schedule or pickups are initiated\nwhen cash in a particular kiosk has reached a specified threshold dollar amount, which we can track on a real-time basis. The armored couriers then confirm cash counts and our\nbank accounts are then credited.\nATM Operations\nWe contract with large and reputable service providers that support the various activities of our BTMs operations related to deployment, repairs and maintenance, and wireless\ncommunications. Operations vendors include, but are not limited to, Bibbeo, Burroughs, Cennox, DropPin, Fiserv, National Services, and OptConnect. We also supplement\nour vendors by insourcing some field activities with several employees who travel to various markets as needed.\nLease Providers\nWe utilize four major lessors to finance approximately 6,000 of our BTMs. We believe these lessors are experienced in lease transactions and have adequate equity reserves.\nWe have been able to negotiate with several lease providers and are able to receive market rates for these lease arrangements. As of December 31, 2023, we have lease\ncommitments to acquire all the kiosks for a bargain purchase option at the end the lease term.\nUser Transactions\nWe hold an amount of Bitcoin in a hot wallet that we own and send Bitcoin to users from that wallet when transactions are completed at a BTM or through BDCheckout. We\nreplenish our hot wallet from time to time through open market purchases of Bitcoin with certain liquidity providers. When a user buys Bitcoin from us, the purchase price is\nbased on the spot price of Bitcoin at the time of the user’s transaction. When a user sells Bitcoin to us, such Bitcoin is held in a Bitcoin Depot hot wallet for a period of time,\nwhich could be up to several days, until such Bitcoin is later sold through a liquidity provider to fund operations or is resold to users transacting at BTM kiosks or through\nBDCheckout; however, the volume of transactions of this type are de minimis. Our policy for transfers from our hot wallet (the private keys to which are stored in\ngeographically dispersed locations throughout the U.S.) that do not involve fulfilling user purchases require dual approval by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating\nOfficer. Transfers from our hot wallet to fulfill user purchases occur automatically through an application program interface that is secured by passwords and login credentials.\nWe do not custody Bitcoin for our kiosk users. Our relationship with our primary liquidity provider allows us to purchase Bitcoin to quickly replenish amounts sold to users,\nwhich means that we hold relatively small amounts of Bitcoin at any given time. Due to the minimal amount of Bitcoin held at any given time (typically less than $1 million),\ncoupled with our high transaction volumes, we do not store Bitcoin in cold wallets.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 124 full-time employees, most of whom were in the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective\nbargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe we have a positive relationship with our employees.\nWe believe that our success is driven by our employees. Our human capital strategy focuses on:\n14\nTable of Contents\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion: We recognize the value of diversity, equity and inclusion within our organization and strive to ensure that our workplace reflects the diverse\ncommunities in which we operate in order to promote collaboration, innovation, creativity and belonging. We are committed to recruiting and employing qualified candidates\nregardless of their gender or cultural background.\nEmployee Benefits: We believe in the importance of offering our employees competitive salaries and wages, together with comprehensive insurance options. We recognize the\nimportance of comprehensive healthcare benefits, including medical, prescription drug, vision and dental, and employees and their family members are provided with tools and\nresources to assist in adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. We offer medical, dental, vision, short and long-term disability, life insurance, match 401K contributions up\nto 3%, and pay for a ClassPass membership.\nTraining and Talent Development: We are committed to the education of our employees and have committed to provide our employees with a variety of learning opportunities,\nincluding, but not limited to, technical skill development, soft skills development, workplace conduct guidance, and IT security training.\nFacilities\nOur principal executive offices and headquarters are located in leased premises at 3343 Peachtree Road NE, Suite 750, Atlanta, Georgia, 30326, consisting of approximately\n5,700 square feet. We also lease office space in Canada, located at 267 Richmond Rd, 3rd Fl., Ottawa, Ontario K1Z 6X3 and consisting of approximately 1,000 square feet. We\nbelieve that these facilities are generally suitable to meet our needs.\nSeasonality and Inflation\nWe have typically experienced seasonality in the 4th quarter of the calendar year in our revenue and the related cost of cryptocurrency. We believe this trend is attributable to\nless business days in the quarter as a result of public holidays. Our costs of goods, services and labor and third-party services, have been impacted by the recent high inflationary\nenvironment. To date, we have been successful in managing these inflationary cost increases. There can be no assurance that our operating results will not continue to be\naffected by inflation in the future or that we will be successful in managing such cost increases.\nGovernmental Regulation\nCurrently, we operate in the U.S. and Canada in a complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment and are subject to a wide range of laws, rules and regulations enacted\nby U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial, and local governments and regulatory authorities. At a high-level, this evolving regulatory environment currently is\ncharacterized by a heightened focus by regulators on the cryptocurrency industry and countering terrorist financing and anti-money laundering. The scope of laws, rules, and\nregulations that can impact our business, including many laws, rules, and regulations that were enacted prior to the creation of the digital financial system, are expansive and\ninclude certain of the requirements that apply to financial services, money transmission, privacy protection, cybersecurity, electronic payments, and securities and commodities\nregulation, as well as bespoke cryptocurrency laws that have been adopted in some jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the applicability of the above-described regulatory\nframework, currently we are not supervised or examined by any banking, securities or commodities regulator such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of\nthe Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the SEC, or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nWe monitor changes to the regulatory environment closely and invest significant resources in our legal and compliance teams to ensure that we are able to design and maintain\nappropriate compliance systems and practices. However, the complexity and evolving nature of our business and the significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the\ndigital financial system and related industries, require us to exercise our judgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to us, and it is possible that regulators\nmay disagree with our conclusions. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation or implementation, as well as our failure to appreciate that\nthe laws and regulations apply to our business, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe regularly monitor official SEC releases and comments made by senior SEC officials, including Chairman Gensler, regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies and related\nactivities. Based on such statements, historical enforcement actions and existing regulations and laws, we have made the determination that our activities and the\ncryptocurrencies that we currently sell, which consists of only Bitcoin, do not subject us to SEC regulation (other than in connection with our status as a public company) and\nthus we believe we are not required to be registered with the SEC to support transactions which consist of only Bitcoin at our BTMs and via BDCheckout. We note that we have\npreviously provided products and services related to Litecoin and Ethereum, however, based on a risk-based determination made after consideration of public statements by the\nSEC, historical enforcement actions, and existing regulations and laws in effect at the time, we have determined to limit our activities to Bitcoin only.\n15\nTable of Contents\nAnti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing\nWe are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws, including the BSA in the U.S. and similar laws and regulations in Canada. In the U.S. as a\nmoney services business registered with the FinCEN, the BSA requires us to develop, implement, and maintain a risk-based anti-money laundering program, provide an anti-\nmoney laundering-related training program, report suspicious activities and transactions, comply with certain reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and collect and\nmaintain information about our users. In addition, the BSA requires us to comply with certain user due diligence requirements as part of our anti-money laundering obligations,\nincluding developing risk-based policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to verify each user’s identity. We have implemented a compliance program\ndesigned to prevent our kiosks, products and services from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activity in countries, or with persons or\nentities, included on designated lists issued by the OFAC, and equivalent foreign authorities. Our compliance program includes policies, procedures, reporting protocols,\ntraining and internal controls, and is designed to address legal and regulatory requirements as well as to assist us in managing business risks associated with money laundering\nand terrorist financing.\nMoney transmission and virtual currency business activity\nIn the U.S., we have obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter, or the equivalent, in the states where we understand such licenses or equivalent are required to conduct\nour business. In addition, we have applied for a BitLicense from the NYDFS. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to a range of legal obligations and requirements\nincluding bonding, net worth maintenance, customer notice and disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and obligations that apply to the safeguarding of third-\nparty funds and crypto assets. In addition, the licensed entity within our corporate structure is subject to inspection and examination by the state licensing agencies and certain\nactions involving that entity, such as changes in controlling equity holders, board members, and senior management, may require regulatory approval.\nPrivacy and protection of user data\nWe are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable\ninformation about our users and employees in the jurisdictions where we operate. We are subject to privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act in the U.S., as well as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada, which impose\ncertain privacy protections and require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program.\nOur business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across state and national borders. As a result, much of the personal data\nthat we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is regulated by multiple privacy and data protection laws and, in some cases, the\nprivacy and data protection laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or\namong us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity practices, and the processing of personal data is increasing in the U.S. and around the world. Regulatory\nauthorities are continuously considering numerous new legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection\nobligations. Any expansion or changes in the application of these privacy, data protection and cybersecurity laws or other regulatory requirements could increase our\ncompliance costs and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nConsumer protection\nThe FTC, the CFPB, and other U.S. federal, state, and local and foreign regulatory agencies regulate business activities, including money transfer services related to remittance\nor user-to-user transfers. These agencies, as well as certain other governmental bodies, including state attorneys general, have broad consumer protection mandates and\ndiscretion in enforcing consumer protection laws, including matters related to unfair or deceptive, and, in the case of the CFPB, abusive, acts or practices, or Unfair, deceptive,\nor abusive acts and practices (“UDAAPs”), and they promulgate, interpret, and enforce rules and regulations that affect our business. The CFPB has enforcement authority to\nprevent an entity that offers or provides financial services or products to consumers in the United States from committing or engaging in UDAAPs, including the ability to\nengage in joint investigations with other agencies, issue subpoenas and civil investigative demands, conduct hearings and adjudication proceedings, commence a civil action,\ngrant relief (e.g., limit activities or functions; rescission of contracts), and refer matters for criminal proceedings.\nAdditional regulatory developments\n16\nTable of Contents\nVarious regulatory authorities continue to evaluate and implement laws, rules and regulations governing a wide variety of issues, including cryptocurrencies, identity theft,\naccount management guidelines, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, marketing, ESG performance, transparency, and reporting, including requirements related to overall corporate\nESG disclosures and climate-related financial disclosures which may impact our business. For an additional discussion on the impact of governmental regulation on our\nbusiness, please see “Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLegal Proceedings\nOn January 13, 2023, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (“Canaccord”) commenced proceedings against Lux Vending, LLC and Bitcoin Depot Operating LLC (collectively, for\npurposes of this paragraph, “Lux Vending”) in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the “Canaccord Claim”). The Canaccord Claim asserts that Canaccord is entitled to $23.0\nmillion in fees alleged to be payable for breach of contract upon the closing of an alleged transaction pursuant to a previously terminated engagement letter between Lux\nVending and Canaccord under which Canaccord was to provide certain financial advisory services. The claim also seeks an award for legal and other costs relating to the\nproceeding. Lux Vending denies the allegations made against it and intends to vigorously defend against them. The range of potential loss related to the identified claim is\nbetween $0 and the $23.0 million, the amount of damages that Canaccord is seeking in the lawsuit. The additional costs mentioned in the claim are not able to be estimated at\nthis time. Apart from the initial exchange of pleadings, as of December 31, 2023, no further steps have been taken in the proceeding.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business. We believe these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nCorporate Information\nOur principal executive office is located at 3343 Peachtree Road NE, Suite 750, Atlanta, Georgia, 30326, which is where our records are kept and the principal business address\nfor our executive officers. Our mailing address is 2870 Peachtree Road #327, Atlanta, Georgia, 30305 and our telephone number is (678) 435-9604.\nLux Vending, LLC was incorporated as a Georgia limited liability company on June 7, 2016. In connection with the Closing, Lux Vending, LLC merged with and into Bitcoin\nDepot Operating LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company, with Bitcoin Depot Operating LLC surviving the merger.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are\nunaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating\nresults, financial condition, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of\nsignificance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you\ncould lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\n•Our transaction volume may be partially dependent on the prices of Bitcoin we sell, which can be volatile. If such prices decline, the volume of user transactions could\ndecrease and our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n•Our long-term success depends on our ability to develop new and innovative products and services to address and keep pace with the rapidly evolving market for\npayments and financial services, and, if we are not able to implement successful\n17\nTable of Contents\nenhancements and new features for our products and services, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n•Our risk management efforts may not be effective, which could expose us to losses and liability and otherwise harm our business.\n•We obtain and process a large amount of sensitive user data. Any real or perceived improper use of, disclosure of, or access to such data could harm our reputation, as\nwell as have an adverse effect on our business.\n•We face intense competition, and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively for any reason, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\n•Converting cash into cryptocurrency (and vice versa) involves risks, which could result in loss of user assets, user disputes and other liabilities, which could adversely\nimpact our business.\n•Disputes with our users could adversely impact our brand and reputation and our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n•There are a number of risks associated with our non-U.S. operations that could adversely affect our business.\n•Our products and services may be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, gambling, tax evasion, and scams. If any of our users use our\nbusiness to further such illegal activities, our business could be adversely affected.\n•If we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products and services, our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition may be significantly harmed.\n•Our products and services may be negatively characterized by consumer advocacy groups, the media or certain federal, state and local government officials, and if those\nnegative characterizations become increasingly accepted by current or potential new users and/or our retail partners, or result in restrictions or limitations on the fees we\ncharge to users, our reputation could be significantly impacted, which when coupled with required modifications to our fee model could result in decreased demand for\nour products and services and a corresponding decrease in our transaction volume, all of which could materially and adversely impact our business.\n•Our strategy and focus on delivering high-quality, compliant, easy-to-use, and secure Bitcoin-related [GL1] services may not maximize short-term or medium-term\nfinancial results.\n•Any significant disruption in our kiosks or software, information technology systems, or any of the blockchain networks related to our business, could result in a loss of\nusers or funds and adversely impact our brand and reputation and our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n•Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related\nactivities, or accept Bitcoin as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities, and we may be exposed to counterparty risk as a result.\n•Due to unfamiliarity and some negative publicity associated with cryptocurrency-related businesses, existing and potential users may lose confidence in cryptocurrency-\nrelated products and services, which could negatively affect our business.\n•We have entered into, and may in the future enter into, acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or relationships, entries into new businesses, joint ventures,\ndivestitures, and other transactions which could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing operations or result in operating difficulties, divert the attention of\nmanagement, liabilities and expenses, harm our business, and negatively impact our results of operations.\n•Our business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for Bitcoin and to adequately manage our Bitcoin balances and kiosk inventory.\n•Cryptocurrency balances, including the cryptocurrency balances we maintain for our own account or cryptocurrency balances that may be maintained for us, and any\ninvestments in cryptocurrency, is subject to volatile market prices, impairment, and other risks of loss.\n•Our failure to safeguard and manage our 3rd party operators' crypto assets could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n•Our products and services may not function as intended due to undetected errors in our software, hardware, and systems, product defects, developmental delays, or due\nto security breaches or incidents or human error in administering these systems, which could damage user or third-party relations, decrease our potential profitability and\nexpose us to liability, and materially and adversely affect our business.\n18\nTable of Contents\n•Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication; a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology\nsystems or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business, force us to incur excessive costs, cause reputational harm and adversely affect\nour business.\n•Litigation or investigations involving us, our agents or other contractual counterparties could result in material settlements, fines or penalties and may adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•Major bank failure or sustained financial market illiquidity, or illiquidity at our clearing, cash management and custodial financial institutions, could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n•Our recent rapid growth, including in our transaction volume, may not be indicative of our future growth. Our rapid growth also makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\n•The further development and acceptance of cryptocurrency networks and other cryptocurrencies, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a\nvariety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely affect an\ninvestment in us.\n•Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance by financial\ninstitutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations, our financial condition, and results of operations.\n•If we are unable to adequately protect our brands and the intellectual property rights related to our existing and any new or enhanced products and services, or if we\ninfringe on the rights of others, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n•BitAccess provides operating software to other BTM operators to run their machines, which could lead to access to information about the operations of our competitors,\ngiving us an anti-competitive advantage that could result in a higher risk of litigation if sufficient controls are not in place.\n•We are subject to economic and geopolitical risk, business cycles, and the overall level of consumer, business and government spending, which could negatively affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n•We depend on major mobile operating systems and third-party platforms. If Google Play, the Apple App Store, or other platforms prevent users from downloading our\nmobile app, our ability to grow may be adversely affected.\n•If miners or validators of Bitcoin demand high transaction fees, our operating results may be adversely affected.\n•We rely on search engines, social networking sites, and other web-based platforms to attract a meaningful portion of our users, and if those search engines, social\nnetworking sites and other web-based platforms change their listings or policies regarding advertising, or increase their pricing or suffer problems, it may limit our ability\nto attract new users.\n•The nature of our business requires the application of complex financial accounting rules. If financial accounting standards undergo significant changes, our operating\nresults could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Privacy Matters\n•Any failure to obtain or maintain necessary money transmission registrations and licenses could adversely affect our operations.\n•We are subject to an extensive and highly evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws, rules, and regulations could\nadversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\n•It may become illegal to acquire, own, hold, sell, or use Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize cryptocurrencies in other countries, which\nwould adversely affect us.\n•The theft, loss, or destruction of private keys required to access any Bitcoin may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our private keys or if we experience a hack or\nother data loss relating to our ability to access any Bitcoin, it could cause regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, and other losses.\n•The digital financial system is novel. As a result, policymakers are just beginning to consider what a regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies should look like and the\nelements that would serve as the foundation for such a regime. If we are unable to effectively react to future proposed legislation and regulation of cryptocurrencies or\ncryptocurrency businesses, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n19\nTable of Contents\n•Our obligations to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, and policies of a variety of jurisdictions may increase and we may be subject to inquiries, investigations, and\nenforcement actions by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental authorities, including those related to sanctions, export control, and anti-money laundering.\n•Complex and evolving U.S. and international laws, rules and regulation regarding privacy and data protection could result in claims, changes to our business practices,\npenalties, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\n•We are subject to compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these\nlaws could result in material settlements, fines, penalties, and increased operating costs, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n•Future developments in tax laws or regulations regarding the treatment and reporting of cryptocurrencies for U.S. and foreign tax purposes could adversely impact our\ntax expense and liabilities, reporting obligations, liquidity, and business.\n•The ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther categories of risk discussed in more detail below include risks related to third parties, our management and employees, our capital structure and our tax receivables\nagreement.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nOur transaction volume may be partially dependent on the prices of Bitcoin we sell, which can be volatile. If such prices decline, the volume of user transactions could\ndecrease and our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the cash paid by customers to purchase Bitcoin from our kiosks. The number of user transactions and our transaction volumes\nmay be partially dependent on the prices of Bitcoin, as well as the associated demand for buying, selling and trading Bitcoin, which can be and historically have been volatile. If\nsuch prices decline, the number of user transactions or our transaction volumes could decrease. As such, any such declines, or any declines in the price of Bitcoin or market\nliquidity for cryptocurrency generally, may result in lower total revenue to us. For example, from January 1, 2020 through March 2024, the trading price of Bitcoin appreciated\nsignificantly, from a low of approximately $3,800 per Bitcoin in March 2020, to a high of approximately $73,750 per Bitcoin in March 2024. The price and trading volume of\nany cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, is subject to significant uncertainty and volatility, depending on a number of factors, including:\n•market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, cryptocurrency;\n•changes in liquidity, market-making volume, and trading activities;\n•trading activities in cryptocurrency, including on other cryptocurrency platforms worldwide, many of which may be unregulated, and may include manipulative\nactivities;\n•investment and trading activities of highly active retail and institutional users, speculators, miners, and investors;\n•the speed and rate at which cryptocurrency is able to gain adoption as a medium of exchange, utility, store of value, consumptive asset, security instrument, or other\nfinancial assets worldwide, if at all;\n•changes in user and investor confidence in cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency platforms;\n•negative publicity and events relating to the digital financial system;\n•unpredictable social media coverage or “trending” of, or other rumors and market speculation regarding cryptocurrency;\n•the ability for cryptocurrency to meet user and investor demands;\n•the functionality and utility of cryptocurrency and its associated ecosystems and networks, including cryptocurrency designed for use in various applications;\n•retail user preferences and perceived value of cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency markets;\n•increased competition from other payment services or cryptocurrency for which we do not sell that exhibit better speed, security, scalability, or other characteristics;\n•regulatory or legislative changes and updates affecting the digital financial system;\n•the characterization of cryptocurrency under the laws of various jurisdictions around the world;\n20\nTable of Contents\n•the adoption of unfavorable taxation policies on cryptocurrency investments by governmental entities;\n•the maintenance, troubleshooting, and development of the blockchain networks underlying cryptocurrency, including by miners, validators, and the development\ncommunity;\n•the ability for cryptocurrency networks to attract and retain miners or validators to secure and confirm transactions accurately and efficiently;\n•legal and regulatory changes affecting the operations of miners and validators of blockchain networks, including limitations and prohibitions on mining activities, or\nnew legislative or regulatory requirements as a result of growing environmental concerns around the use of energy in mining cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, and\nother proof-of-work mining activities;\n•ongoing technological viability and security of cryptocurrency and its associated smart contracts, applications and networks, including vulnerabilities against hacks\nand scalability;\n•fees and speed associated with processing cryptocurrency transactions, including on the underlying blockchain networks and on cryptocurrency platforms;\n•financial strength of market participants;\n•the availability and cost of funding and capital;\n•interruptions in service from or failures of major cryptocurrency platforms;\n•availability of an active derivatives market for various cryptocurrencies;\n•availability of banking and payment services to support cryptocurrency-related projects;\n•level of interest rates and inflation;\n•monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, and fiat currency devaluations; and\n•national, North American and international economic and political conditions.\nThere is no assurance that any given cryptocurrency will maintain or increase in value or that there will be meaningful transaction volumes from our users. In the event that the\nprice or trading of, or demand for, cryptocurrency declines, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to develop new and innovative products and services to address and keep pace with the rapidly evolving market for payments\nand financial services, and, if we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services, our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in digital banking, mobile financial apps, ATMs\nand BTMs, and point-of-service solutions, as well as developments in cryptocurrency and in tokenization, which replaces sensitive data (e.g., payment card information) with\nsymbols (tokens) to keep the data safe in the event that sensitive data is stolen or viewed by unauthorized third parties.\nThese new and evolving services and technologies may be superior to, impair, or render obsolete the products and services we currently offer or the technologies we currently\nuse to provide them. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we may not be\nsuccessful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. Our ability to develop new and innovative products and services may be inhibited by\nindustry-wide standards, payment networks, existing and future laws and regulations, resistance to change from our users or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Our\nsuccess will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and to adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to provide enhancements\nand new features for our products and services or to develop new and innovative products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological\ndevelopments and evolving industry standards, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe often rely not only on our own initiatives and innovations, but also on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new\ntechnologies and development of a robust market for these new products and technologies. Failure to accurately predict or to respond effectively to developments in our industry\nmay significantly impair our business.\n21\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, because our BitAccess software is designed to operate with a variety of systems and devices, we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services\nto keep pace with changes in technologies. Any failure of our BitAccess software to continue to operate effectively with new technologies could reduce our growth\nopportunities, the demand for our products and services, result in dissatisfaction of our users, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective, which could expose us to losses and liability and otherwise harm our business.\nWe offer payments and other products and services to a large number of users. We have programs designed to vet and monitor these users and the transactions we process for\nthem as part of our risk management efforts, but such programs require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud and illegitimate\ntransactions. When our services are used to process illicit transactions, and we settle those funds to users and are unable to recover them, we suffer losses and liability.\nAdditionally, illicit transactions can also expose us to governmental and regulatory enforcement actions.\nThe highly automated nature of, and liquidity offered by, our services make us and our users a target for illegal or improper uses, including scams and fraud directed at our\nusers, fraudulent or illegal sales of goods or services, money laundering, and terrorist financing. Our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may not\nbe sufficient to identify all risks to which we are exposed, to enable us to prevent or mitigate the risks we have identified, or to identify additional risks to which we may become\nsubject in the future. Our current business, changing and uncertain economic, geopolitical, and regulatory environment, and anticipated domestic and international growth will\ncontinue to place significant demands on our risk management and compliance efforts, and we will need to continue developing and improving our existing risk management\ninfrastructure, techniques, and processes.\nWe maintain insurance policies providing general liability, umbrella and excess liability coverage, each of which has an aggregate limit between $2 million to $5 million, as\nwell as coverage relating to cyber-related incidents, having an aggregate policy limit of approximately $2 million. Typically, these insurance policies have one-year terms, and\nwe are able to apply for term renewal at the end of each calendar year. With respect to termination provisions included in the subject policies, we have the option to terminate\neach policy by providing notice to the applicable provider and fulfilling our obligation to pay the minimum earned premium due under the applicable policy. While we maintain\na program of insurance coverage for various types of liabilities, we may self-insure against certain business risks and expenses where we believe we can adequately self-insure\nagainst the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not available or deemed not cost-effective.\nWe obtain and process a large amount of sensitive user data. Any real or perceived improper use of, disclosure of, or access to such data could harm our reputation, as well\nas have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe obtain and process large amounts of sensitive data, including personal data related to our users and their transactions, such as their names, addresses, social security or tax\nidentification numbers, copies of government-issued identification, facial recognition data (from scanning of photographs for identity verification), bank statements and\ntransaction data. We face risks, including to our reputation, in the handling and protection of this data, and these risks will increase as our business expands, including through\nour acquisition of, and investment in, other companies and technologies. Federal, state, and international laws and regulations governing privacy, data protection, and e-\ncommerce transactions require us to safeguard our users’, employees’, and service providers’ personal data.\nWe have administrative, technical, and physical security measures and controls in place and maintain an information security program. However, our security measures, or the\nsecurity measures of companies we acquire, may be inadequate or breached as a result of third-party action, employee or service provider error, malfeasance, malware,\nphishing, hacking attacks, system error, trickery, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, inadequate facility security or otherwise, and,\nas a result, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information, including personal data, on our systems. We could be the target of a cyber security\nincident, which could result in harm to our reputation and financial losses. Additionally, our users have been and could be targeted in cyber security incidents like an account\ntakeover, which could result in harm to our reputation and financial losses. Additionally, privacy and data protection laws are evolving, and these laws may be interpreted and\napplied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data handling safeguards and practices that could result in fines, lawsuits, and other penalties, and significant changes to our\nbusiness practices and products and services. Our future success depends on the reliability and security of our products and services. To the extent that the measures we or any\ncompanies we acquire have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, or to the extent we discover a security breach suffered by a company we acquire following the closing\nof such acquisition, we may become subject to litigation, breach notification obligations, or regulatory or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines,\npenalties, damages, harm to our reputation, or loss of users. If our own confidential business information or sensitive user information were improperly disclosed, our business\ncould be adversely affected. Additionally, a party who circumvents our security measures could, among other effects, appropriate user information or other proprietary data,\ncause interruptions in our operations, or expose users to hacks, viruses, and other disruptions.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe face intense competition, and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively for any reason, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we face a variety of current and potential competitors that may have larger and more established user bases and\nsubstantially greater financial, operational, marketing and other resources than we have. The digital financial system is highly innovative, rapidly evolving, and characterized by\nhealthy competition, experimentation, changing user needs, frequent introductions of new products and services, and subject to uncertain and evolving industry and regulatory\nrequirements. We expect competition to intensify as existing and new competitors introduce new products and services or enhance existing ones. We compete against a number\nof companies operating both within the U.S. and abroad, including traditional financial institutions, financial technology companies and brokerage firms that have entered the\ncryptocurrency market in recent years, digital and mobile payment companies offering overlapping features targeted at our users, and companies focused on cryptocurrency.\nThe products and services provided by our competitors are differentiated by features and functionalities, including brand recognition, user service, reliability, distribution\nnetwork and options, price, speed, and convenience. Distribution channels such as online, mobile solutions, account deposit and kiosk-based services continue to evolve and\nimpact the competitive environment for cryptocurrency transactions. For example, traditional financial institutions could offer competing cryptocurrency-related products and\nservices to our existing and prospective users.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to compete effectively in Bitcoin transaction-related services. For example, if our products and services do not offer competitive\nfeatures and functionalities or if we do not keep up with technological advances, we may lose users to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to charge our users comparable and appropriate transaction and other fees relative to our competitors, users may not\nuse our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, transaction volume, where we face intense competition,\ncould be adversely affected by pricing pressures between our services and those of some of our competitors, which could reduce the markup at which we sell Bitcoin to users\nand the separate flat transaction fee that we charge and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have the ability to implement fee adjustments from\ntime to time in response to competition and other factors. Fee reductions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the short-term and may also\nadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the long-term if transaction volumes do not increase sufficiently in response.\nMany innovative start-up companies and larger companies have made, and continue to make, significant investments in research and development, and we expect these\ncompanies to continue to develop similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our products and services. Further, more traditional financial and non-\nfinancial services businesses may choose to offer cryptocurrency-related services in the future as cryptocurrencies gain adoption. Our current and potential competitors may\nestablish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources.\nOur existing competitors have, and our potential competitors are expected to have, various competitive advantages over us, such as:\n•the ability to trade cryptocurrencies, and offer products and services, that we do not support or offer (due to constraints from regulatory authorities, our banking\npartners, and other factors) such as tokens that constitute securities or derivative instruments under U.S. or foreign laws;\n•greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger user bases, and larger market shares;\n•larger sales and marketing budgets and organizations;\n•more established marketing, banking, and compliance relationships;\n•greater user support resources;\n•greater resources to make acquisitions;\n•lower labor, compliance, risk mitigation, and research and development costs;\n•larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios;\n•greater number of applicable licenses, registrations or similar authorizations;\n•established core business models outside of facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, allowing them to operate on lesser margins or at a loss;\n•operations in certain jurisdictions with lower compliance costs and greater flexibility to explore new product offerings; and\n23\nTable of Contents\n•substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take costly actions in response to the actions of our competitors, our business, operating\nresults, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nConverting cash into cryptocurrency (and vice versa) involves risks, which could result in loss of user assets, user disputes and other liabilities, which could adversely\nimpact our business.\nTo own, transfer and use a cryptocurrency on its underlying blockchain network, a person must have a private and public key pair associated with a network address, commonly\nreferred to as a “wallet.” Each wallet is associated with a unique “public key” and “private key” pair, each of which is a string of alphanumerical characters. Our mobile app\nallows our users to receive and transfer Bitcoin using an un-hosted digital wallet (which can be created by a user via our mobile app) or by inputting the information for any\nother digital wallet. Also, some blockchain networks may require additional information to be provided in connection with any transfer of Bitcoin to or from a user’s wallet. A\nnumber of errors can occur in the process of converting cash into or transferring Bitcoin by way of our mobile platform, such as typos, mistakes, or the failure to include the\ninformation required by the blockchain network. For instance, a user may incorrectly enter the desired recipient’s public key. Alternatively, a user may transfer Bitcoin to a\nwallet address that such user does not own, control, or hold the private keys to. In addition, each wallet address is only compatible with the underlying blockchain network on\nwhich it is created. For instance, a Bitcoin wallet address can only be used to send and receive Bitcoin. If any Ethereum or other cryptocurrency is sent to a Bitcoin wallet\naddress, or if any of the foregoing errors occur, all of the user’s sent cryptocurrency will be permanently and irretrievably lost with no means of recovery. We have encountered\nand expect to encounter similar incidents with our users. Such incidents could result in user disputes, damage to our brand and reputation, legal claims against us, and financial\nliabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nDisputes with our users could adversely impact our brand and reputation and our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFrom time to time we have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and disputes with our users with respect to our products and services, such as regarding the\nexecution and settlement of cryptocurrency trades, fraudulent or unauthorized transactions, account takeovers, deposits and withdrawals of cryptocurrency, failures or\nmalfunctions of our systems and services, or other issues relating to our products and services. Additionally, the ingenuity of criminal fraudsters may cause our users to be\nsubject to ongoing account takeovers and identity fraud issues. While we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, there is no guarantee that they will be\nsuccessful and, in any case, require continuous improvement and optimization for continually evolving forms of fraud to be effective. There can be no guarantee that we will be\nsuccessful in detecting and resolving these disputes or defending ourselves in any of these matters, and any failure may result in impaired relationships with our users, damage\nto our brand and reputation, and substantial fines and damages. In some cases, the measures we have implemented to detect and deter fraud have led to poor user experiences,\nincluding indefinite account inaccessibility for some of our users, which increases our user support costs and can compound damages. We could incur significant costs in\ncompensating our users, such as if a transaction was unauthorized, erroneous, or fraudulent. We could also incur significant legal expenses resolving and defending claims, even\nthose without merit. To the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill our regulatory obligations, we could also lose our authorizations, registrations or licenses or become\nsubject to conditions that could make future operations more costly, impair our ability to grow, and adversely impact our operating results. We are subject to investigation and\nenforcement action by state, federal, and international consumer protection agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission\n(“FTC”), state attorneys general in the U.S., the Canadian Office of Consumer Affairs, and other similar U.S. and Canadian government authorities, each of which monitors user\ncomplaints against us and, from time to time, escalates matters for investigation and potential enforcement against us.\nWhile certain of our agreements with users contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to class action litigation, some federal,\nstate, and foreign courts have refused or may refuse to enforce one or more of these provisions, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these\narbitration provisions, including the class action waiver provisions, in the future or in any given case. Legislative, administrative, or regulatory developments may directly or\nindirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions. Any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of\nsuch arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits, including additional class action litigation, and significantly limit our ability to avoid\nexposure from class action litigation.\nThere are a number of risks associated with our non-U.S. operations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe provide products and services in the U.S. and Canada and may in the future expand in various international markets. Our ability to grow in international markets and our\nfuture results could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n•difficulty in attracting a sufficient number of users or retail partners, or a lack of acceptance of our products and services;\n24\nTable of Contents\n•failure to anticipate competitive conditions and competition with service providers or other market players that have grater experience in the local markets than we\ndo;\n•difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and managing foreign operations in an environment of diverse cultures, laws and customs;\n•challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences and the increased travel, infrastructure and other resources associated with international operations;\n•failure to conform with applicable business customs, including translation into foreign languages, cultural context and associated expenses;\n•any inability or difficulties supporting or integrating with local third-party providers;\n•changes in political and economic conditions and potential instability in certain regions, including in particular the recent civil unrest, terrorism, political turmoil and\neconomic uncertainty in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and other regions;\n•restrictions on money transfers to, from and between certain countries;\n•currency controls, new currency adoptions and repatriation issues;\n•changes in regulatory requirements or in foreign policy, including the adoption of domestic or foreign laws, regulations and interpretations detrimental to our business\n(including, but not limited to, with respect to payments, privacy, data protection, information security and tax);\n•difficulty in gaining acceptance from industry self-regulating bodies;\n•possible increased costs and additional regulatory burdens imposed on our business, including tariffs, sanctions, fines or other trade restrictions;\n•changes to or the implementation of new U.S. sanctions, resulting in bank closures in certain countries, the ultimate freezing of our assets, adverse effects on existing\nbusiness relationships, and/or restrictions on entering into new business relationships where carrying on business would violate such sanctions;\n•burdens of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations;\n•potential increased exposure to public health issues such as pandemics, and related industry and governmental actions to address these issues;\n•possible fraud or theft losses and lack of compliance by international representatives in foreign legal jurisdictions where collection and legal enforcement may be\ndifficult or costly;\n•reduced protection of our intellectual property rights;\n•unfavorable tax rules or trade barriers; and\n•failure to successfully manage our exposure to non-U.S. dollar exchange rates.\nIn the future, if a material portion of our revenue is generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, we will be subject to risks associated with changes in the value of our\nrevenues denominated in non-U.S. dollars. As exchange rates among the U.S. dollar and other currencies fluctuate, the impact of these fluctuations may have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations or financial condition as reported in U.S. dollars.\nOur products and services may be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, gambling, tax evasion, and scams. If any of our users use our\nbusiness to further such illegal activities, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products and services may be exploited to facilitate illegal activity including fraud, money laundering, gambling, tax evasion, and scams. We may be specifically targeted\nby individuals seeking to conduct fraudulent transfers, and it may be difficult or impossible for us to detect and avoid such transactions in certain circumstances. The use of our\nproducts and services for illegal or other illicit purposes could subject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations,\nprosecutions, enforcement actions, inquiries, or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us. Moreover, certain activities that may be legal in one\njurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction, and certain activities that are at one time legal may in the future be deemed illegal in the same jurisdiction. As a result, there\nis significant uncertainty and cost associated with detecting and monitoring transactions for compliance with local laws. In the event that a user is found responsible for\nintentionally or inadvertently violating the laws in any jurisdiction, we may be subject to governmental inquiries, enforcement actions, prosecuted, or otherwise held secondarily\nliable for aiding or facilitating such activities. Changes in law have also increased the penalties for money transmitters for\n25\nTable of Contents\ncertain illegal activities, and government authorities may consider increased or additional penalties from time to time. Government authorities may seek to bring legal action\nagainst money transmitters, including us, for involvement in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items. Any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational\nharm, and any resulting liabilities, loss of transaction volume, or increased costs could harm our business.\nMoreover, while fiat currencies can be used to facilitate illegal activities, cryptocurrencies are relatively new and, in many jurisdictions, may be lightly regulated or largely\nunregulated. Many types of cryptocurrencies have characteristics, such as the speed with which cryptocurrency transactions can be conducted, the ability to conduct transactions\nwithout the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions, the irreversible nature of certain cryptocurrency\ntransactions, and encryption technology that anonymizes these transactions, that make cryptocurrency susceptible to use in illegal activity. U.S. federal and state and foreign\nregulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, such as the Department of Justice, SEC, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FTC, or the Internal Revenue\nService (“IRS”), and various state securities and financial regulators have taken and continue to take legal action against persons and entities alleged to be engaged in fraudulent\nschemes or other illicit activity involving cryptocurrency. Facilitating transactions in cryptocurrency, including those that obscure the identities of the sender and/or receiver,\nmay cause us to be at increased risk of liability arising out of anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations.\nLike many money service businesses, we face a variety of unique challenges when it comes to anti-money laundering compliance, which require us to implement compliance\nprograms unique in comparison to a bank or large financial institution. Our kiosks operate in retail store fronts detached from the store’s core business operations which\nnecessitates all Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering data collection to be automated at the kiosk without any interpersonal interactions. Further, individuals\nattempting to shield the ultimate beneficiary of these transactions often move funds from these transactions multiple times. In addition, we do not typically trace where the\nBitcoin is sent following the delivery of the Bitcoin from Bitcoin Depot to the user which could make it easier for users to obscure the ultimate beneficiary or end use of the\nBitcoin purchased from us, especially when those looking to commit fraud or launder money could present different or even fictitious, counterfeit, or altered identification on\nseparate occasions.\nWhile we have designed our risk management and compliance framework to detect significant illicit activities conducted by our potential or existing users, we cannot ensure\nthat we will be able to detect all illegal or other illicit activity on our platform. If any of our users use our platform to further such illegal or other illicit activities, our business\ncould be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products and services, our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition may be significantly harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain existing users and attract new users to increase engagement with our products and services. To do so, we must continue to offer\nleading technologies and ensure that our products and services are secure, reliable, and engaging. We must also expand our products and services and offer competitive\ntransaction and other fees in an increasingly crowded and price-sensitive market. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so, that we will be able to retain\nour current users or attract new users, or keep our users engaged. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\n•we fail to increase awareness of our brand and successfully compete with the offerings and prices other companies, or if our users otherwise increasingly engage with\ncompeting products and services, including those that we are unable to offer due to regulatory reasons;\n•we fail to introduce new and improved products and services, or if we introduce new products or services that are not favorably received;\n•we fail to successfully identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business;\n•we fail to support new and in-demand cryptocurrencies or if we elect to support cryptocurrencies with negative reputations;\n•there are changes in sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products and services or concerns related to privacy, security, or other factors including, without\nlimitation, changes in macro-level user preference for using cash to purchase Bitcoin;\n•there are adverse changes in our products and services that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation;\n•we fail to maintain existing authorizations as well as obtain newly required authorizations, registrations and licenses for our products;\n26\nTable of Contents\n•users perceiving Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be a bad investment, or experiencing significant losses in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, may not desire to\nutilize our products and services;\n•technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products and services with the speed, functionality, security and reliability that our users expect, or if we\nfail to otherwise gain and maintain the trust and confidence of our users;\n•there are cyber security incidents, employee or service provider misconduct or other unforeseen activities that cause losses to us or our users;\n•there are modifications to our fee model, including as a result of changes in or the adoption of any laws or regulations imposing restrictions or limitations on the\nmarkup at which we sell Bitcoin to users or the separate flat transaction fee that we are able to charge our users, or modifications by competitors to their fee models;\n•we fail to provide adequate customer service for our users and retail partners;\n•regulatory and governmental bodies in countries that we target for expansion express negative views towards cryptocurrency-related services and, more broadly, the\ndigital financial system; or\n•we or other companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user\nbase and user engagement, our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected. Any decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products and\nservices less attractive to users, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue, business, operating results, and financial condition. If our user growth rate slows or\ndeclines, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive growth of revenue.\nOur products and services may be negatively characterized by consumer advocacy groups, the media or certain federal, state and local government officials, and if those\nnegative characterizations become increasingly accepted by current or potential new users and/or our retail partners, or result in restrictions or limitations on the fees we\ncharge to users, our reputation could be significantly impacted, which when coupled with required modifications to our fee model could result in decreased demand for our\nproducts and services and a corresponding decrease in our transaction volume, all of which could materially and adversely impact our business.\nCertain media reports have asserted that laws and regulations regarding cryptocurrencies and related transactions and activities should be broader and more restrictive. In many\ncases, these media reports can focus on fees charged to users, which are often alleged to be higher than the fees typically charged by banks or similar institutions, as well as\nmarketing tactics, which are alleged to target socioeconomically vulnerable communities. The fees and marketing strategies associated with our kiosks are from time to time\ncharacterized by consumer advocacy groups and media reports as predatory or abusive without discussing the numerous benefits to users. If the negative characterization of our\nmarketing strategies and/or fee structure becomes increasingly accepted by current or potential new users or our retail partners, demand for our products and services could\ndecrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such characterizations, or if there are modifications to our fee model, including as a result of changes in or the adoption of\nany laws or regulations imposing restrictions or limitations on the markup at which we sell Bitcoin to users, we may experience declines in user loyalty and transactions and our\nrelationships with our retail partners may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, any\nactions by our competitors that are challenged by users, advocacy groups, the media or governmental agencies or entities as being abusive or predatory, could result in our\nproducts and services being perceived as unlawful or inappropriate activities or business practices, merely because we operate in the same general industries as such\ncompetitors. Such perception, whether or not accurate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur strategy and focus on delivering high-quality, compliant, easy-to-use, and secure Bitcoin-related services may not maximize short-term or medium-term financial\nresults.\nWe have taken, and expect to continue to take, actions that we believe are in the best interests of our users and the long-term interests of our business, even if those actions do\nnot necessarily maximize short-term or medium-term results. These include expending significant managerial, technical, and legal efforts on complying with laws and\nregulations that are applicable to our products and services and protecting our and our users’ data. For instance, our compliance personnel costs are approximately $2.0 million\nannually. Substantially all of our operating costs with respect to regulation and compliance are correlated with our transaction volumes, and mainly driven by payroll to employ\na growing number of personnel to support the expansion of our business. We also focus on driving\n27\nTable of Contents\nlong-term engagement with our users through innovation and developing new industry-leading products and technologies. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-\nterm and medium-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, which could have an adverse effect on our business,\noperating results, and financial condition.\nAny significant disruption in our kiosks or software, information technology systems, or any of the blockchain networks related to our business, could result in a loss of\nusers or funds and adversely impact our brand and reputation and our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur reputation and ability to attract and retain users and grow our business depends on our ability to operate our products and services at high levels of reliability, scalability,\nand performance, including the ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, the transactions that occur across multiple systems. Our kiosks and software, the ability of our\nusers to transact in Bitcoin, and our ability to operate at a high level, are dependent on our ability to access the blockchain networks underlying the supported Bitcoin, for which\naccess is dependent on our systems’ ability to access the internet. Further, the successful and continued operations of such blockchain networks will depend on a network of\ncomputers, miners, or validators, and their continued operations, all of which may be impacted by service interruptions.\nOur kiosks and certain cryptocurrency and blockchain networks have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, service interruptions or degradation\nbecause of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, insider threats, break-ins, sabotage, human error, vandalism,\nearthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks,\ncomputer viruses or other malware, or other events. In addition, extraordinary transactions or site usage could cause our kiosks to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even\nfail.\nIf any of our kiosks are disrupted for any reason, our products and services may fail, resulting in unanticipated disruptions, slower response times and delays in our users’\ntransaction execution and processing, failed transactions, incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of transactions, unauthorized transactions, loss of user\ninformation, increased demand on limited user support resources, user claims, complaints with regulatory organizations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions. A prolonged\ninterruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or functionality of our products and services could harm our business. Significant or persistent interruptions\nin our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our kiosks or software are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use\nof our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our\nusers, these users could seek significant compensation from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to\naddress. Problems with the reliability or security of our kiosks or software would harm our reputation, and damage to our reputation and the cost of remedying these problems\ncould negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nBecause we are a regulated money services business in certain jurisdictions, interruptions have resulted and in the future may result in regulatory scrutiny, and significant or\npersistent interruptions could lead to significant fines and penalties, and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices, and ultimately could cause us to lose existing\nlicenses or banking and other relationships that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional authorizations, registrations or licenses that may be required\nfor our business.\nIn addition, we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies. We also rely on technologies developed by others, and if we are unable to\ncontinue to obtain licenses for such technologies or licenses to substitute for similar technologies, our business could be adversely impacted. Implementation of new systems and\ntechnologies is complex, expensive, time-consuming, and may not be successful. If we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies, or\nimprovements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies, or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended, it could have an adverse impact on\nour business, internal controls (including internal controls over financial reporting), operating results, and financial condition.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related\nactivities, or accept Bitcoin as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our securities, and we may be exposed to counterparty risk as a result.\nAlthough a number of significant U.S. banks and investment institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, Citi Group, J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and BlackRock, have indicated\nthey plan to begin allowing their customers to carry and invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the acceptance and use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by banks is\nrelatively uncommon and may never become mainstream. Indeed, a number of companies and individuals engaged in Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have\nbeen unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with banking services. Similarly, a number of\n28\nTable of Contents\ncompanies and individuals or businesses associated with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing banking services discontinued\nwith financial institutions in response to government action, particularly in China, where the regulatory response to cryptocurrencies has been to exclude their use for ordinary\nconsumer transactions within China. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. To date, we have not experienced such issues in finding banks\nor financial institutions willing to provide services to us that has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The difficulty that many\nbusinesses that provide Bitcoin and/or derivatives on other digital asset-related activities have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to\nprovide them services may be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrency as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrency and could decrease\ncryptocurrency’s usefulness and harm its public perception in the future.\nThe public perception of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency could be damaged if banks or financial institutions were to close the accounts of businesses engaging in Bitcoin and/or other\ncryptocurrency-related activities. This could occur as a result of compliance risk, cost, government regulation, or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance\nand settlement firms, national stock and derivatives on commodities exchanges, the over-the-counter market and the Depository Trust Company. The adoption or\nimplementation of similar policies, rules or regulations by these or similar entities could negatively affect our relationships with financial institutions and impede our ability to\nconvert Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our\nstrategy at all, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and harm investors.\nDue to unfamiliarity and some negative publicity associated with cryptocurrency-related businesses, existing and potential users may lose confidence in cryptocurrency-\nrelated products and services, which could negatively affect our business.\nCryptocurrency and related products and services are relatively new. Many of our competitors are unlicensed, unregulated, operate without supervision by any governmental\nauthorities, and do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management team, corporate practices, cybersecurity, and regulatory\ncompliance. As a result, users and the general public may lose confidence in cryptocurrency businesses, including regulated businesses like ours.\nSince the inception of the digital financial system, numerous cryptocurrency businesses have been sued, investigated, or shut down due to fraud, manipulative practices,\nbusiness failure, and security breaches. In many of these instances, customers of these businesses were not compensated or made whole for their losses. Larger businesses like\nus are more appealing targets for hackers and malware and may also be more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement actions. For example, in May 2019, Binance, one of\nthe world’s largest platforms, was hacked, resulting in losses of approximately $40 million, and in February 2021, Bitfinex settled a long-running legal dispute with the State of\nNew York related to Bitfinex’s alleged misuse of over $800 million of customer assets. Further, in the first half of 2022, major cryptocurrency lending platforms declared\nbankruptcy, resulting in a loss of confidence in participants of the digital financial system and negative publicity surrounding cryptocurrency more broadly.\nIn addition, there have been reports that a significant amount of cryptocurrency trading volume on cryptocurrency businesses is fabricated and false in nature, with a specific\nfocus on unregulated businesses located outside the U.S. Such reports may indicate that the market for cryptocurrency business activities is significantly smaller than otherwise\nunderstood.\nWe have entered into, and may in the future enter into, acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or relationships, entries into new businesses, joint ventures,\ndivestitures, and other transactions which could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing operations or result in operating difficulties, divert the attention of\nmanagement, liabilities and expenses, harm our business, and negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions and evaluate opportunities for possible acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships and relationships,\nentries into new businesses, joint ventures, divestitures, and other transactions. We have in the past acquired or invested in, and we continue to seek to acquire or invest, in\nbusinesses, technologies, or other assets that we believe could complement or expand our business, including acquisitions of new lines of business that are adjacent to or outside\nof our existing products and services. As we grow, the pace and scale of our acquisitions may increase and may include larger acquisitions than we have done historically. The\nidentification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisition or strategic investment transactions may divert the attention of management and entail various expenses,\nwhether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable\ntransaction opportunities. In addition to transaction and opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, whether or not such transactions are completed,\nany of which could harm our business and negatively impact our results of operations, including risks that:\n•the transaction may not advance our business strategy or may harm our growth or profitability;\n29\nTable of Contents\n•we may not be able to secure required regulatory approvals or otherwise satisfy closing conditions for a proposed transaction in a timely manner, or at all;\n•the transaction may subject us to additional regulatory burdens that affect our business in potentially unanticipated and significantly negative ways;\n•we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or increase our revenue;\n•we may experience difficulty, and may not be successful in, integrating technologies, IT or business enterprise systems, culture, or management or other personnel\nof the acquired business;\n•we may incur significant acquisition costs and transition costs, including in connection with the assumption of ongoing expenses of the acquired business;\n•we may not realize the expected benefits or synergies from the transaction in the expected time period, or at all;\n•we may be unable to retain key personnel;\n•acquired businesses or businesses that we invest in may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations,\nincluding with respect to data privacy, data protection, and information security, and our due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities;\n•acquired businesses’ technology stacks may add complexity, resource constraints, and legacy technological challenges that make it difficult and time consuming to\nachieve such adequate controls, processes, and procedures;\n•we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings, or other circumstances prior to acquiring or investing in a business, which could\nresult in additional financial,\n•legal, regulatory, or tax exposure and may subject us to additional controls, policies, procedures, liabilities, litigation, costs of compliance or remediation, or other\nadverse effects on our business, operating results, or financial condition;\n•we may have difficulty entering into new market segments or new geographic territories;\n•we may be unable to retain the users, vendors, and partners of acquired businesses;\n•there may be lawsuits or regulatory actions resulting from the transaction;\n•there may be risks associated with undetected security weaknesses, cyberattacks, or security breaches or incidents at companies that we acquire or with which we\nmay combine or partner;\n•there may be local and foreign regulations applicable to the international activities of our business and the businesses we acquire; and\n•acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt.\nAlso, in the future we may choose to divest certain businesses, products, or services. If we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty obtaining terms acceptable\nto us in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, we may experience difficulty separating out portions of, or entire, businesses, incur loss of revenue or experience negative\nimpact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits. Such potential transactions may also delay achievement of our strategic objectives, cause\nus to incur additional expenses, disrupt user or employee relationships, and expose us to unanticipated or ongoing obligations and liabilities, including as a result of our\nindemnification obligations. Further, during the pendency of a divestiture, we may be subject to risks such as a decline in the business to be divested, loss of employees, users,\nor suppliers and the risk that the transaction may not close, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the business to be divested and our retained business. If a\ndivestiture is not completed for any reason, we may not be able to find another buyer on the same terms, and we may have incurred significant costs without the corresponding\nbenefit.\nJoint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational,\nregulatory, and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling\nstockholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business\ndecisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling stockholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect\nthe value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for Bitcoin and to adequately manage our Bitcoin balances and kiosk inventory.\nWe invest broadly in our business, and such investments are partially driven by our expectations of the future success of Bitcoin. An inability to correctly forecast the success of\nBitcoin could harm our business. For example, we must forecast kiosk inventory needs and expenses based on our estimates of future demand for Bitcoin and our products and\nservices, and place orders for kiosks sufficiently in advance with our third-party suppliers. In addition, we must forecast demand for Bitcoin to maintain our holdings of Bitcoin\nat sufficient levels to meet customer needs, while minimizing the potential to hold Bitcoin at levels that could subject us to significant exposure to price volatility. Our ability to\naccurately forecast demand for Bitcoin and consequently, our products and services, could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in demand for Bitcoin\nor for our competitors’ products or services, changes in general market or economic conditions, and business closures.\nIf we underestimate demand for our products or services, the suppliers of our kiosks may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities to meet the demand, and we may experience\na shortage of kiosks for deployment. If we overestimate demand for our products and services, we may purchase or lease excess kiosks and the excess kiosks may become\nobsolete or out-of-date, which may result in write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess kiosks at discounted prices, which could negatively impact our operating results\nand our business.\nCryptocurrency balances, including the cryptocurrency balances we maintain for our own account or cryptocurrency balances that may be maintained for us, and any\ninvestments in cryptocurrency, is subject to volatile market prices, impairment, and other risks of loss.\nWe had approximately $0.7 million and $0.5 million of cryptocurrency as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The prices of cryptocurrencies have\nbeen highly volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, including as a result of various associated risks and uncertainties. For example, the prevalence of\ncryptocurrency is a relatively recent trend, and the long-term adoption of cryptocurrency by investors, consumers, and businesses remains uncertain. The lack of a physical\nform, reliance on technology for creation, existence, and transactional validation, and decentralization may subject cryptocurrencies’ integrity to the threat of malicious attacks\nand technological obsolescence. We currently no longer hold any cryptocurrency as an investment, rather we only hold Bitcoin for operational purposes. To the extent the\nmarket value of the Bitcoin we hold continues to decrease relative to the purchase prices, our financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nMoreover, cryptocurrencies are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in its market value below our book\nvalue for such asset at any time subsequent to its acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price\nincreases until a sale, which may adversely affect our operating results in any period in which such impairment occurs. We have recorded such impairment charges. If there are\nfuture changes in applicable accounting rules that require us to change the manner in which we account for our cryptocurrencies, there could be a material and adverse effect on\nour financial results and the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur failure to safeguard and manage our 3rd party operators' crypto assets could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe safeguard crypto assets on behalf of our third-party operators as defined by SAB 121.\nWe believe our policies, procedures, operational controls and controls over financial reporting, protect us from material risks surrounding the safeguarding of these assets and\nconflicts of interest. Our financial statements and disclosures, as a whole, are available through periodic filings on a quarterly basis, and compliant with annual audit\nrequirements of Article 3 of Regulation S-X.\nAny inability by us to maintain our safeguarding procedures, perceived or otherwise, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Accordingly, we take\nsteps to ensure third-party operator wallets are always secure. Third-party operator wallets are maintained in their own segregated wallet. We safeguard crypto assets using\nproprietary technology and operational processes. Crypto assets are not guaranteed by any government or government agency, however we have insurance against loss of these\nassets are insured under our insurance policy coverage as our own crypto assets for operational purposes.\nAny material failure by us to maintain the necessary controls, policies, procedures or to manage the crypto assets we hold for our own operating purposes could also adversely\nimpact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur security technology is designed to prevent, detect, and mitigate inappropriate access to our systems, by internal or external threats. We believe we have developed and\nmaintained administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to comply with applicable legal requirements and industry standards. However, it is nevertheless\npossible that hackers, employees or service providers acting contrary to our policies, or others could circumvent these safeguards to improperly access our systems or\ndocuments, or the systems or documents of our business partners, agents, or service providers, and improperly access, obtain, misuse third-party operator crypto\n31\nTable of Contents\nassets and funds. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be\ndifficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. Our ability to maintain insurance is also subject to the insurance carriers’ ongoing underwriting criteria. Any loss of\nthird-party operators' crypto assets could result in a subsequent lapse in insurance coverage, which could cause a substantial business disruption, adverse reputational impact,\ninability to compete with our competitors, and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or actions. Additionally, transactions undertaken through our websites or other electronic\nchannels may create risks of fraud, hacking, unauthorized access or acquisition, and other deceptive practices. Any security incident resulting in a compromise of third-party\noperator cryptocurrency assets could result in substantial costs to us and require us to notify impacted operators, and in some cases regulators, of a possible or actual incident,\nexpose us to regulatory enforcement actions, including substantial fines, limit our ability to provide services, subject us to litigation, significant financial losses, damage our\nreputation, and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur products and services may not function as intended due to undetected errors in our software, hardware, and systems, product defects, developmental delays, or due to\nsecurity breaches or incidents or human error in administering these systems, which could damage user or third-party relations, decrease our potential profitability and\nexpose us to liability, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur software, hardware, systems, and processes may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly to the\nextent such errors or vulnerabilities are not detected and remedied quickly. We have from time to time found defects in our user-facing software and hardware, internal systems,\nand technical integrations with third-party systems, and new errors or vulnerabilities may be introduced in the future. If there are such errors or defects in our software,\nhardware, or systems, we may face negative publicity, government investigations, and litigation. Additionally, we rely on a limited number of component and product suppliers\nlocated outside of the U.S. to manufacture our products. If there are defects in the manufacture of our kiosks, we may face similar negative publicity, investigations, and\nlitigation, and we may not be fully compensated by our suppliers for any financial or other liability that we suffer as a result. As our hardware and software services continue to\nincrease in size and complexity, and as we integrate new, acquired subsidiaries with different technology stacks and practices, these risks may correspondingly increase as well.\nIn addition, we provide incremental releases of product and service updates and functional enhancements, which increase the possibility of errors. Any errors, data leaks,\nsecurity breaches or incidents, disruptions in services, or other performance problems with our products or services caused by external or internal actors could hurt our\nreputation and damage our business. Software and system errors, or human error, could delay or inhibit settlement of payments, result in over settlement, cause reporting errors,\nor prevent us from collecting transaction- based fees, or negatively impact our ability to serve our users. Similarly, security breaches or incidents, which may be caused by or\nresult from cyber-attacks by hackers or others, computer viruses, worms, ransomware, other malicious software programs, security vulnerabilities, employee or service provider\ntheft, misuse or negligence, phishing, identity theft or compromised credentials, denial-of-service attacks, or other causes, could impact our business and disrupt the proper\nfunctioning of our products or services, cause errors, allow loss or unavailability of, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, proprietary, confidential or otherwise sensitive\ninformation of ours or our users, and other destructive outcomes. Any of the foregoing issues could result in costly and time-consuming efforts to redesign and redistribute our\nproducts, give rise to regulatory inquiries and investigations, and result in lawsuits and other liabilities and losses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nCybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication; a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems\nor cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business, force us to incur excessive costs, cause reputational harm and adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nThe size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional\nactions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and\nindividuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts\nwill prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the\nfinancial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely\naffect our business operations and result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial, legal, business and\nreputational harm to us.\nLitigation or investigations involving us, our agents or other contractual counterparties could result in material settlements, fines or penalties and may adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to allegations and complaints that individuals or entities have used our products and services for fraud-induced money transfers,\nas well as certain money laundering activities, which may result in fines, penalties,\n32\nTable of Contents\njudgments, settlements and litigation expenses. We also are the subject from time to time of litigation related to our business. The outcome of such allegations, complaints,\nclaims and litigation cannot be predicted.\nRegulatory and judicial proceedings and potential adverse developments in connection with ongoing litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results\nof operations. There may also be adverse publicity associated with lawsuits and investigations that could decrease third-party and consumer use and acceptance of our products\nand services. Additionally, our business may be the subject of class action lawsuits including securities litigation, regulatory actions and investigations and other general\nlitigation. The outcome of class action lawsuits, including securities litigation, regulatory actions and investigations and other litigation is difficult to assess or quantify but may\ninclude substantial fines and expenses, as well as the revocation of required authorizations, registrations or licenses or the loss of approved status, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations or users’ confidence in our business. Plaintiffs or regulatory agencies in these lawsuits, actions or\ninvestigations may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of these actions may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to\ndefend or settle future lawsuits or investigations may be significant. In addition, improper activities, lawsuits or investigations involving third parties may adversely impact our\nbusiness operations or reputation even if we are not directly involved.\nMajor bank failure or sustained financial market illiquidity, or illiquidity at our clearing, cash management and custodial financial institutions, could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks in the event of a sustained deterioration of financial market liquidity, as well as in the event of sustained deterioration in the liquidity, or failure, of our\nclearing, cash management and custodial financial institutions. In particular:\n•we may be unable to access funds in our deposit accounts on a timely basis. Any resulting need to access other sources of liquidity or short-term borrowing would\nincrease our costs. Any delay or inability to settle transactions with users or our contractual counterparties could adversely impact our business, financial condition\nand results of operations;\n•in the event of a major bank failure or other adverse financial event impacting where our cash, cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits are held, we could face\nmajor risks to the recovery of such deposits. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $1.6 million of our $29.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and interest-bearing\ndeposits was not subject to insurance protection against loss or was in excess of the deposit insurance limits at banks;\n•further, to facilitate the purchasing process for Bitcoin on the cryptocurrency exchange operated by Gemini Trust Company, LLC, we maintain a minimum USD\nbalance needed for anticipated Bitcoin purchases for any given day, all or a portion of which may not be subject to insurance protection against loss;\n•our existing debt financing agreements are sources of funding for our corporate transactions and liquidity needs. If any of the lenders participating in our debt\nfinancing agreements were unable or unwilling to fulfill its lending commitment to us, our short-term liquidity and ability to engage in corporate transactions, such as\nacquisitions, could be adversely affected; and\n•we may be unable to borrow from financial institutions or institutional investors on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth\nstrategy and fund key strategic initiatives.\nIf financial liquidity deteriorates, there can be no assurance we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur recent rapid growth, including in our transaction volume, may not be indicative of our future growth. Our rapid growth also makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nOur revenue was approximately $689.0 million in 2023 and $646.8 million in 2022. We have recently experienced significant growth in our transaction volume from the years\nended December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. However, even if our transaction volume continues to increase, we expect that our growth rate will decline in the future as a\nresult of a variety of factors, including the increasing scale of our business, new entrants into the market and the maturation of the BTM operator industry. Overall growth of our\ntransaction volume depends on a number of factors, and we may not successfully accomplish our objectives, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our future operating\nresults. If the assumptions that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our market, or if we are unable to maintain or grow transaction\nvolumes, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability. Additionally, if we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face,\nincluding those associated with the factors listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our growth rate will be adversely affected. You\nshould not rely on our results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future transaction volumes or revenue growth.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe further development and acceptance of cryptocurrency networks and other cryptocurrencies, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a\nvariety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely affect an\ninvestment in us.\nCryptocurrency that may be used to buy and sell goods and services, among other things, are a new and rapidly evolving industry which is subject to a high degree of\nuncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the digital asset industry, as well as the digital asset networks, include:\n•continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies;\n•governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the digital asset\nnetwork or similar cryptocurrency systems;\n•the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of cryptocurrency networks;\n•changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n•the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;\n•general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrency; and\n•the impact of regulators focusing on cryptocurrencies and digital securities and the costs associated with such regulatory oversight.\n•A decline in the popularity or acceptance of the digital asset networks could adversely affect an investment in us.\nWe are, or may in the future, be susceptible to risks arising from disruptions in crypto asset markets. Such risks could potentially result in, among other things:\n•the depreciation of investments held in us, including the depreciation in the price of our publicly traded stock;\n•decreased user demand for our products and services;\n•financing risks to us, including relating to our ability to obtain equity and debt financing;\n•increased losses or impairments of the crypto assets held by us;\n•legal proceedings and government investigations involving us or our affiliates or other third-parties with which we do business; or\n•indirect risks to our business due to any adverse impact of recent or future crypto market disruptions on our users, suppliers or other counterparties.\nAdditionally, although we are not directly connected to recent crypto market events, we may still suffer reputational harm due to our association with the cryptocurrency\nindustry in light of the recent disruption in, or as a result of any future disruptions in, the crypto asset markets. Specifically, recent negative publicity stemming from these\nmarket disruptions and speculation of potential future disruptions increases our risk of reputational harm simply by association with the industry.\nFurther, any future market disruptions resulting in overall decreased interest in Bitcoin could harm our business. The prevalence of cryptocurrency is a relatively recent trend,\nand the long-term adoption of cryptocurrency by investors, consumers, and businesses remains uncertain.\nThe number of user transactions and our transaction volumes is partially dependent on the price of Bitcoin, as well as the associated demand for buying, selling, and trading\nBitcoin, which can be and historically have been volatile. If such prices decline, the number of user transactions or our transaction volumes could decrease. As such, any such\ndeclines, or any declines in the price of Bitcoin or market liquidity for cryptocurrency generally, may result in lower total revenue to us due to an associated decrease in demand\nfor our products and services. The price and trading volume of any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, is subject to significant uncertainty and volatility, depending on a number\nof factors, as discussed elsewhere in this section under the subheading “—Our transaction volume may be partially dependent on the prices of Bitcoin we sell, which can be\nvolatile. If such prices decline, the volume of user transactions could decrease and our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.”\n34\nTable of Contents\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance by financial institutions\nor transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nActual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance, or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other\ncompanies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the\npast and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), was closed by the California Department of\nFinancial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank Corp.\n(“Signature”), and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. Although a statement by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC indicated that all depositors of SVB would have access to all of their money after only one business day of closure, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts,\nborrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other financial instruments with SVB, Signature or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership\nby the FDIC may be unable to access undrawn amounts thereunder. Although we are not a borrower under or party to any material letter of credit or any other such instruments\nwith SVB, Signature or any other financial institution currently in receivership, and we are not a borrower under or party to any credit agreement with such institutions, if we\nenter into any such instruments and any of our lenders or counterparties to such instruments were to be placed into receivership, we may be unable to access such funds. In\naddition, if any of our partners, suppliers or other parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with\nsuch a financial institution, such parties’ ability to pay their obligations to us or to enter into new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be\nadversely affected. In this regard, counterparties to SVB credit agreements and arrangements, and third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit (among others), may\nexperience direct impacts from the closure of SVB and uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry. Similar impacts have occurred in\nthe past, such as during the 2008 to 2010 financial crisis.\nInflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities with interest rates below current market interest\nrates. Although the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to $25 billion of loans to financial\ninstitutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of such instruments, widespread\ndemands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediate liquidity may exceed the capacity of such program. Additionally, we regularly\nmaintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the FDIC standard insurance limit, and there is no guarantee that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the\nFDIC and the Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure of such banks or financial institutions, or that they would do\nso in a timely fashion.\nOur access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be\nsignificantly impaired by factors that affect us, any financial institutions with which we enter into credit agreements or arrangements directly, or the financial services industry\nor economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of\nfinancial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations\nabout the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which we\nhave financial or business relationships but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. We have not materially modified\nor updated our policies and practices as they relate to our banking partners and related counterparties in light of the recent financial services industry instability.\nThe results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material adverse effects on our current and projected business operations\nand our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n•delayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other financial assets;\n•inability to enter into credit facilities or other working capital resources;\n•potential or actual breach of contractual obligations that require us to maintain letters of credit or other credit support arrangements; or\n•termination of cash management arrangements and/or delays in accessing or actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements.\nIn addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or\ncosts and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit\n35\nTable of Contents\nand liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and\nliquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses or other obligations, financial or otherwise, result in breaches of our\nfinancial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors\ndescribed above or other related or similar factors, could have material adverse effects on our liquidity and our current and/or projected business operations and financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn addition, any further deterioration in the macroeconomic economy or financial services industry could lead to losses or defaults by our partners, vendors or suppliers, which\nin turn could have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial condition. For example, a partner may fail\nto make payments when due, default under their agreements with us, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy, or a supplier may determine that it will no longer deal with us as a\ncustomer. In addition, a vendor or supplier could be adversely affected by any of the liquidity or other risks that are described above as factors that could result in material\nadverse effects on us, including but not limited to delayed access or loss of access to uninsured deposits or loss of the ability to draw on existing credit facilities involving a\ntroubled or failed financial institution. The bankruptcy or insolvency of any partner, vendor or supplier, or the failure of any partner to make payments when due, or any breach\nor default by a partner, vendor or supplier or the loss of any significant supplier relationships, could cause us to suffer material losses and may have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our brands and the intellectual property rights related to our existing and any new or enhanced products and services, or if we\ninfringe on the rights of others, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur brands are important to our business. We utilize trademark registrations in the countries we operate and other tools to protect our brands. Our business would be harmed if\nwe were unable to adequately protect our brands and the value of our brands was to decrease as a result.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect the intellectual property rights\nrelated to our products and services. We also investigate the intellectual property rights of third parties to prevent our infringement of those rights. We may be subject to third-\nparty claims alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights or have misappropriated other proprietary rights. We may be required to spend resources to defend such\nclaims or to protect and police our own rights, including maintenance costs as well as expenses associated with sending and responding to demand letters and with\nadministrative proceedings or litigation. We cannot be certain of the outcome of any such allegations. Some of our intellectual property rights may not be protected by\nintellectual property laws, particularly in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe loss of our intellectual property protection, the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection or to successfully defend against claims of intellectual property\ninfringement could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operation.\nBitAccess provides operating software to third-party BTM operators to run their machines, which could lead to access to information about the operations of our\ncompetitors, giving us an anti-competitive advantage that could result in a higher risk of litigation if sufficient controls are not in place.\nBitAccess provides operating software to multiple BTM operators. Through our acquisition of BitAccess, we supply software to some of our competitors. If a party (whether\ninternal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third-party) is able to circumvent our data security systems or those of the competitors to whom we supply software, or engage in\ncyber-attacks, such party could obtain our competitors’ proprietary information, the loss, theft or inaccessibility of, unauthorized access to, or improper use or disclosure of, our\ncompetitors’ data and/or significant interruptions in our competitors’ operations. Further, if sufficient controls are not in place, or if we fail to implement adequate data security\npractices or fail to comply with our policies or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our competitors’ information may be improperly (even if inadvertently)\naccessed, used or disclosed. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we could potentially have visibility into the operations of our competitors, which may give us an unfair, anti-\ncompetitive advantage. As a result, we could be subject to claims of alleged infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of the intellectual property rights of our\ncompetitors or other third parties in the operation of our business, including for our use of our competitors’ or other third-party intellectual property rights or our internally\ndeveloped or acquired intellectual property and technologies. Consequently, this could lead to a higher litigation risk in the future. We maintain a comprehensive portfolio of\ninsurance policies to\n36\nTable of Contents\nmeet both our legal obligations and to cover perceived risks within our business, but we cannot know whether our coverage and the deductibles under these policies are\nadequate to protect us against the aforementioned risks that we face.\nWe are subject to economic and geopolitical risk, business cycles, and the overall level of consumer, business and government spending, which could negatively affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe cryptocurrency payments technology industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. We are exposed to general economic\nconditions that affect consumer confidence, spending, and discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits. A sustained deterioration in general economic\nconditions in the markets in which we operate, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressure or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial performance by\nreducing demand for cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-based services and thereby reducing transaction volumes. A reduction in transaction volumes could result in a\ndecrease in our revenues and profits.\nA downturn in the economy could force retailers or financial institutions to close or petition for bankruptcy protection, resulting in lower revenue and earnings for us. We also\nhave a certain amount of fixed costs, such as rents, debt service, and salaries, which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the\neconomy. Changes in economic conditions could also adversely affect our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, our business, growth, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic\nconditions; inflation; changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, whether caused by a change in government or otherwise; increased\ndifficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict; or action by the U.S. or foreign governments that may restrict our\nability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities. A possible slowdown in global trade caused by increasing tariffs or other\nrestrictions could decrease consumer or corporate confidence and reduce consumer, government and corporate spending in countries inside or outside the U.S., which could\nadversely affect our operations. Climate-related events, including extreme weather events and natural disasters and their effect on critical infrastructure in the U.S. or\ninternationally, could have similar adverse effects on our operations, users, or third-party suppliers.\nWe depend on major mobile operating systems and third-party platforms. If Google Play, the Apple App Store, or other platforms prevent users from downloading our\nmobile app, our ability to grow may be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon third-party platforms for the distribution of certain products and services. Our mobile app is provided as a free application through both the Apple App Store and\nthe Google Play Store. The Google Play Store and Apple App Store are global application distribution platforms and the main distribution channels for our mobile app. As such,\nthe promotion, distribution, and operation of our mobile app is subject to the respective platforms’ terms and policies for application developers, which are very broad and\nsubject to frequent changes and re-interpretation.\nThe terms and conditions under which we access these distribution platforms may contain restrictions related to cryptocurrencies that could be broadly construed, and if\nconstrued to encompass the functionality of our mobile app, could limit the nature and scope of services that can be offered. If our products and services are found to be in\nviolation of any such terms and conditions, we may no longer be able to offer our products and services through such third-party platforms. There can be no guarantee that\nthird-party platforms will continue to support our mobile application, or that users will be able to continue to use our products and services. Any changes, bugs, technical or\nregulatory issues with third-party platforms, our relationships with mobile manufacturers and carriers, or changes to their terms of service or policies could degrade our app’s\nfunctionalities, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our app, give preferential treatment to competitive products and services, limit our ability to deliver high quality\nofferings, or impose fees or other charges, any of which could affect usage of our products and services and harm our business.\nIf miners or validators of Bitcoin demand high transaction fees, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nMiners and validators are individuals or entities who operate a computer or group of computers that add new transactions to blocks, and verify blocks created by other miners.\nMiners collect transaction fees and are rewarded with new tokens for their services, which such fees and rewards can be unpredictable. When a user buys Bitcoin from a kiosk,\nminer fees incurred to process the withdrawal transaction on the underlying blockchain network are an inherent component of the transaction costs. If the block rewards for\nminers on any blockchain network are not sufficiently high to incentivize miners, miners may demand higher transaction fees, or collude to reject low transaction fees and force\nusers to pay higher fees. Although we generally attempt to pass miner fees through to our users, we may incur from time to time, reduced margins related to higher miner fees in\nexcess of what we expect when we charge a transaction fee to our users, resulting in adverse impacts on our operating results.\n37\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on search engines, social networking sites, and other web-based platforms to attract a meaningful portion of our users, and if those search engines, social\nnetworking sites and other web-based platforms change their listings or policies regarding advertising, or increase their pricing or suffer problems, it may limit our ability\nto attract new users.\nMany users locate our website and kiosks through internet search engines, such as Google, and advertisements on social networking sites and other web-based platforms. If we\nare listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, downloads of our mobile application, and visits to our website and kiosks, could decline\nsignificantly, and we may not be able to replace this traffic. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search results. If the search\nengines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms, we may appear less prominently or not at all in search results, which could result in reduced traffic to\nour website or kiosks that we may not be able to replace. Additionally, if the costs of search engine marketing services, such as Google AdWords, increase, we may incur\nadditional marketing expenses, we may be required to allocate a larger portion of our marketing spend to this channel or we may be forced to attempt to replace it with another\nchannel (which may not be available at reasonable prices, if at all), and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, competitors may in the future bid on search terms that we use to drive traffic to our website and engagement with current and potential users. Such actions could\nincrease our marketing costs and result in decreased traffic to our website or use of our application and kiosks. In addition, search engines, social networking sites and other\nweb-based platforms may change their advertising policies from time to time. If any change to these policies delays or prevents us from advertising through these channels, it\ncould result in reduced traffic to our website or use of our application and kiosks. Additionally, new search engines, social networking sites and other web-based platforms may\ndevelop in specific jurisdictions or more broadly that reduce traffic on existing search engines, social networking sites and other web-based platforms. Moreover, the use of\nvoice recognition technology such as Alexa, Google Assistant, Cortana, or Siri may drive traffic away from search engines, potentially resulting in reduced traffic to our\nwebsite or use of our application and kiosks. If we are not able to achieve awareness through advertising or otherwise, we may not achieve significant traffic to our website,\nmobile application or kiosks.\nThe nature of our business requires the application of complex financial accounting rules. If financial accounting standards undergo significant changes, our operating\nresults could be adversely affected.\nThe accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”), the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our\nreported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example, on March 31, 2022,\nthe staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, or SAB 121, which represents a significant change regarding how a company safeguarding crypto assets held for\nits platform users reports such crypto assets on its balance sheet and requires retrospective application as of January 1, 2022. Moreover, recent actions and public comments\nfrom the FASB and the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial reporting and internal controls. In addition, many companies’ accounting policies are being subjected to\nheightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. Further, there has been limited precedent for the financial accounting of crypto assets and related valuation and revenue\nrecognition. Currently, we account for the crypto assets we hold for operating purposes as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, which requires us to measure these crypto\nassets at cost less impairment. As a result of the high volatility in the crypto economy and of crypto asset prices, which may continue to experience significant declines, we may\ncontinue to record impairment charges on the crypto assets we hold in a particular period.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (ASU 2023-08): Accounting for and\nDisclosure of Crypto Assets, which represents a significant change in how entities that hold crypto assets will account for certain of those holdings. ASU 2023-08 will require\nus to measure crypto assets that meet the scope criteria at fair value and to reflect changes in fair value in net income each reporting period. The amendments in ASU 2023-08\nwill also require us to present crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other intangible assets on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value measurement of\ncrypto assets separately from changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets on the income statement. The amendments in ASU 2023-08 are effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.\nUncertainties in or changes to regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the need to change our accounting methods and restate our financial statements and\nimpair our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, which could adversely affect our financial statements, result in a loss of investor confidence, and more\ngenerally impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Privacy Matters\n38\nTable of Contents\nAny failure to obtain or maintain necessary money transmission registrations and licenses could adversely affect our operations.\nWe currently operate in states where we have obtained the requisite licenses to the extent that the laws and regulations of such states clearly indicate that a license is required or\nwhere state regulators have advised us that we need a license to operate. In the U.S., we are registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement\nNetwork of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“FinCEN”) and are currently also licensed to operate as a money transmitter in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,\nFlorida, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. In Canada, we are registered\nwith the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (\"FINTRAC\") as a money services business. We have applied for a BitLicense from the New York\nState Department of Financial Services and have money transmitter license applications pending in Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,\nMinnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. We also currently operate in states where we do not believe we are required, or\nhave been informed by the relevant jurisdiction that we are not required, to obtain money transmitter licenses or any other required licenses. This belief is based on our analysis\nof the applicable laws and regulations and/or our communications with the regulators in the relevant jurisdiction. We plan to apply for money transmitter or virtual currency\nlicenses or their equivalents in additional jurisdictions as needed. As we obtain additional licenses, we may be required to bear ongoing costs to comply with the requirements of\nthe additional states or jurisdictions. If our licenses are not renewed, we are denied licenses in additional states or jurisdictions where we choose to apply for a license, or\njurisdictions that have previously not required a license require a license in the future, we could be forced to seek a license or change our business practices.\nAs a money services business and a money transmitter, we are subject to a range of legal obligations and requirements including bonding, net worth maintenance, user notice\nand disclosure, reporting, recordkeeping and cybersecurity requirements, and obligations that apply to the safeguarding of third-party funds and crypto assets. In addition, the\nlicensed entity within our corporate structure is subject to inspection and examination by the state licensing agencies and certain actions involving that entity, such as changes in\ncontrolling equity holders, board members, and senior management, may require regulatory approval. Further, if we were found by these regulators to be in violation of any\napplicable laws, rules, or regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, and enforcement actions, additional compliance requirements, increased regulatory\nscrutiny of our business, restriction of our operations, or damage to our reputation or brand. Regulatory requirements are constantly evolving, and we cannot predict whether we\nwill be able to meet changes to existing regulations or the introduction of new regulations without such compliance harming our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted rules that require money transmitters, money services businesses, or virtual currency businesses to establish and maintain transaction\nmonitoring, filtering, scanning and cybersecurity programs. Wherever we are subject to these rules, we are required to adopt business practices that require additional\nexpenditures and impact our operating results.\nAdditionally, if federal, state, or international regulators were to take actions that limit or prohibit us or our business partners from continuing to operate our business or their\nbusinesses as currently operated, whether by imposing additional requirements, compliance obligations or sanctions, such actions could harm our business. Any change to our\nbusiness practices that makes our service less attractive to users or prohibits use of our services by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease our transaction volume\nand harm our business.\nWe are subject to an extensive and highly evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws, rules, and regulations could\nadversely affect our brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to extensive laws, rules, regulations, policies, orders, determinations, directives, and legal and regulatory interpretations and guidance in the markets in\nwhich we operate. The scope of laws, rules, and regulations that can impact our business is expansive and includes certain of the requirements that apply to financial services,\nmoney transmission, privacy protection, cybersecurity, electronic payments, securities and commodities regulation, data governance, data protection, fraud detection, marketing\n(including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991), civil rights (including the Americans with Disabilities Act, which generally requires, among other things, that our\nBTMs be accessible to individuals with disabilities, such as visually- impaired persons), competition, bankruptcy, tax, anti-bribery, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money\nlaundering, and counter-terrorist financing as well as bespoke cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency laws that have been adopted in some jurisdictions that can impact\ncryptocurrency custody, exchange, and transfer, cross-border and domestic cryptocurrency transmission.\nMany of these legal and regulatory regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile technologies, cryptocurrencies, and related technologies. As a result, some\napplicable laws, rules and regulations do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with cryptocurrencies or the digital financial system, are subject to significant\nuncertainty, and vary widely across U.S. federal, state, and local and international jurisdictions. These legal and regulatory regimes evolve frequently and may be modified,\ninterpreted, and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. Moreover, the complexity and evolving nature of our\nbusiness and the significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of cryptocurrencies and the\n39\nTable of Contents\ndigital financial system requires us to exercise our judgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to us, and it is possible that governmental bodies and\nregulators may disagree with our conclusions. For example, in light of the regulatory uncertainty around what digital assets qualify as “securities” under U.S. federal securities\nlaws, we elected to only transact in Bitcoin and stop offering transactions of Litecoin and Ethereum.\nTo the extent we have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, revocation of authorizations, registrations or licenses,\nlimitations on our products and services, whistleblower complaints, reputational harm, and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could\nadversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to existing laws, rules and regulations, various governmental and regulatory bodies, including legislative and executive bodies, in the U. S. and in other jurisdictions\nmay adopt new laws, rules, regulations and regulatory requirements. For example, we could become subject to laws, regulations or other regulatory action imposing restrictions,\ndisclosure requirements or limitations on the transaction fees that we are able to charge our users for Bitcoin transactions, including the markup at which we sell Bitcoin to users\nand the separate flat transaction fee that we charge. As a result, we may not be able to sell Bitcoin at a profitable margin, which would adversely affect our revenue and\nfinancial condition. Furthermore, new interpretations of existing laws, rules, and regulations may be issued by such bodies or the judiciary, which may adversely impact the\ndevelopment of the digital financial system as a whole and our legal and regulatory status in particular by changing how we operate our business, how our products and services\nare regulated, and what products or services we and our competitors can offer, requiring changes to our compliance and risk mitigation measures, imposing new registration or\nlicensing requirements, or imposing a total ban on certain Bitcoin transactions, as has occurred in certain jurisdictions in the past.\nWe are subject to ongoing supervision, examination, oversight, and reviews and currently are, and expect in the future, to be subject to investigations and inquiries, by U.S.\nfederal and state regulators, and foreign financial service regulators. As a result of findings from these reviews and examinations, regulators have, are, and may in the future\nrequire us to take certain actions, including amending, updating, or revising our compliance policies and procedures from time to time, limiting the kinds of users that we\nprovide services to, changing, terminating, or delaying our registrations or licenses and the introduction of our existing or new product and services, and undertaking further\nexternal audits. From time to time, we may receive examination reports citing violations of rules and regulations, inadequacies in existing compliance programs, and requiring\nus to enhance certain practices with respect to our compliance program, including user due diligence, transaction monitoring, training, and regulatory reporting and\nrecordkeeping. Implementing appropriate measures to properly remediate these examination findings may require us to incur significant costs, and if we fail to properly\nremediate any of these examination findings, we could face civil litigation, significant fines, damage awards, forced removal of certain employees including members of our\nexecutive team, barring of certain employees from participating in our business in whole or in part, revocation of existing authorizations, registrations or licenses, limitations on\nexisting and new products and services, reputational harm, negative impact to our existing relationships with regulators, exposure to criminal liability, or other regulatory\nconsequences. Further, we believe increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements and additional regulatory investigations and enforcement, any of which could occur or\nintensify, may continue to result in changes to our business practices, as well as increased costs, and supervision and examination for ourselves and our service providers.\nMoreover, new laws, rules, regulations, or interpretations may result in additional litigation, regulatory investigations, and enforcement or other actions, including preventing or\ndelaying us from offering certain products or services offered by our competitors or could impact how we offer such products and services. Adverse changes to, or our failure\nto comply with, any laws, rules, and regulations have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our reputation and brand and our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition.\nIt may become illegal to acquire, own, hold, sell, or use Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize cryptocurrencies in other countries, which\nwould adversely affect us.\nAlthough currently the use of cryptocurrencies generally is not restricted in most countries, countries such as China and Russia have taken harsh regulatory actions to curb the\nuse of cryptocurrencies and may continue to take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use cryptocurrencies or to\nexchange them for fiat currency. In September 2021, China instituted a blanket ban on all cryptocurrency transactions and mining, including services provided by overseas\ncryptocurrency exchanges in mainland China, effectively making all cryptocurrency-related activities illegal in China. In other nations, including Russia, it is illegal to accept\npayment in cryptocurrency for consumer transactions, and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. In January 2022, the\nCentral Bank of Russia called for a ban on cryptocurrency activities ranging from mining to trading. While our operations are currently limited to the U.S. and Canada, such\nrestrictions may adversely affect our growth potential or us if the restrictions limit the large-scale use of cryptocurrency or if the use of cryptocurrency becomes\n40\nTable of Contents\nconfined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe theft, loss, or destruction of private keys required to access any Bitcoin may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our private keys or if we experience a hack or\nother data loss relating to our ability to access any Bitcoin, it could cause regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm, and other losses.\nBitcoin is generally accessible only by the possessor of the unique private key relating to the digital wallet in which the Bitcoin is held. While blockchain protocols typically\nrequire public addresses to be published when used in a transaction, private keys must be safeguarded and kept private to prevent a third-party from accessing the Bitcoin held\nin the applicable wallet. To the extent that any of the private keys relating to our wallets containing Bitcoin held for our own account or our users’ private keys relating to their\nun-hosted wallets is lost, destroyed, or otherwise compromised or unavailable, and no backup of the private key is accessible, we or our users will be unable to access the\nBitcoin held in the related wallet. Further, we cannot provide assurance that our or our users’ wallets will not be hacked or otherwise compromised. Cryptocurrency and\nblockchain technologies have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, hacking, or other malicious activities. Any loss of private keys relating to, or any hack\nor other compromise of, digital wallets used to store our users’ Bitcoin could adversely affect our users’ ability to access or sell their Bitcoin, as well as result in loss of user trust\nin us. As such, any loss of private keys due to a hack, employee or service provider misconduct or error, or other compromise by third parties could hurt our brand and\nreputation, result in significant losses, and adversely impact our business. The balance in Bitcoin Depot’s hot wallets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, was approximately\n$0.7 million. The average balance in Bitcoin Depot’s hot wallets during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nThe digital financial system is novel. As a result, policymakers are just beginning to consider what a regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies should look like and the\nelements that would serve as the foundation for such a regime. If we are unable to effectively react to future proposed legislation and regulation of cryptocurrencies or\ncryptocurrency businesses, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe digital financial system is novel. As a result, many policymakers are just beginning to consider what a regulatory regime for cryptocurrency should look like and the\nelements that would serve as the foundation for such a regime. As cryptocurrency has grown in both popularity and market size, various U.S. federal, state, and local and\nforeign governmental organizations, consumer protection agencies, and public advocacy groups have been examining the operations of cryptocurrency networks, users and\nplatforms, with a focus on how cryptocurrencies can be used to launder the proceeds of illicit activities, fund criminal or terrorist enterprises, and the safety and soundness of\nplatforms and other service providers that hold cryptocurrencies for users. Many of these entities have called for heightened regulatory oversight, and have proposed legislation\nand regulations, undertaken enforcement actions and/or issued consumer advisories describing the risks posed by cryptocurrencies to users and investors. The impacts of such\npotential and proposed heightened regulatory oversight are not yet known.\nFor example, in Connecticut, Substitute House Bill 6752 concerns digital assets, authorizes the state banking commissioner to adopt, amend and rescind regulations, forms and\norders governing the business use of digital assets, defines virtual currency address, virtual currency kiosk and virtual currency wallet, and establishes certain requirements\napplicable to owners or operators of virtual currency kiosks. Additionally, on October 13, 2023, Governor Newsom signed the California Digital Financial Assets Law and\nSenate Bill 401, which together will regulate virtual currency activities within the state when the laws become fully effective on July 1, 2025 with some provisions becoming\neffective beginning January 1, 2024. Although the governor has acknowledged that certain aspects of the laws are ambiguous, these pending additions to the California\nFinancial Code aim to regulate digital financial asset transaction kiosks (a “crypto kiosk”), including by imposing the following: (i) for operators that permit customers to\nmaintain fiat currency balances, limiting to $1,000 per day the amount of funds that the operator can accept from, or dispense to a California resident at its crypto kiosks\neffective January 1, 2024; (ii) limiting the direct and indirect charges an operator may collect from a customer for a single transaction to the greater of $5 or 15% of the dollar\nequivalent of the digital assets involved in the transaction effective January 1, 2025; (iii) requiring that specific information (including the amount of fees, expenses and\ncharges, as well as any spread between the dollar price of the digital asset charged to the customer and the dollar price for that asset listed by a digital asset exchange) be\ndisclosed both prior to a transaction and on transaction receipts printed by crypto kiosks following the transaction, effective January 1, 2025; and (iv) requiring operators to\nprovide the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (the “DFPI”) with a list of all locations of the crypto kiosks that the operator owns, operates or\nmanages in California, which the DFPI would publish on the DFPI’s website effective July 1, 2025. Although we believe we will be able to comply with the new California\nlaws (as well as similar laws in New York state) when it becomes effective, final regulations have not yet been published and may prove to be more challenging than expected\nfor compliance.\nIn addition, other state agencies may propose and adopt new regulations (or interpret existing regulations) in ways that could result in significant adverse changes in the\nregulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, regardless of whether these or other new laws are adopted. Competitors, including providers of traditional financial services, have\nspent years cultivating professional relationships with\n41\nTable of Contents\nrelevant policymakers on behalf of their industry so that those policymakers may understand that industry, the current legal landscape affecting that industry, and the specific\npolicy proposals that could be implemented to responsibly develop that industry. The lobbyists working for these competitors have similarly spent years developing and\nworking to implement strategies to advance these industries. Members of the digital financial system have started to engage policymakers directly and with the help of external\nadvisors and lobbyists, but this work is still in a relatively nascent stage. As a result, our industry may not be able to adequately engage with legislators regarding new laws,\nrules, and regulations that may be proposed and adopted in the U.S. and internationally, or regarding interpretations of existing laws, rules, and regulations that may be\ninterpreted in new ways, that harm the digital financial system or digital asset businesses, and which could in turn adversely impact our business.\nOur obligations to comply with the laws, rules, regulations, and policies of a variety of jurisdictions may increase and we may be subject to inquiries, investigations, and\nenforcement actions by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental authorities, including those related to sanctions, export control, and anti-money laundering.\nIf we expand our non-U.S. activities, we may become obligated to comply with additional laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations of both the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate and those into which we offer products and services on a cross-border basis. For instance, financial regulators outside the U.S. have in recent months\nsignificantly increased their scrutiny of digital asset exchanges, such as by requiring digital asset exchanges operating in their local jurisdictions to be regulated and licensed\nunder local laws. Moreover, laws regulating financial services, the internet, mobile technologies, cryptocurrencies, and related technologies outside of the U.S. are evolving,\nextensive and could impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. In addition, we are required to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations related to economic sanctions and export controls enforced by U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, and U.S. anti-money\nlaundering and counter-terrorist financing laws, rules, and regulations enforced by FinCEN and certain state financial services regulators. U.S. sanctions and export control laws\nand regulations generally restrict dealings by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction with certain jurisdictions that are the target of comprehensive embargoes, currently the Crimea\nRegion, the Donetsk People’s Republic of Ukraine, the Luhansk People’s Republic of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, as well as with persons, entities, and\ngovernments identified on certain prohibited party lists. Moreover, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.S., the E.U., the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions\nhave imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russia and Belarus and persons and entities associated with Russia and Belarus. There can be no certainty regarding whether such\ngovernments or other governments will impose additional sanctions, or other economic or military measures against Russia or Belarus.\nWe have an Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) compliance program in place that includes monitoring of IP addresses to identify prohibited jurisdictions and of\nblockchain addresses that have either been identified by OFAC as prohibited or that otherwise are believed by us to be associated with prohibited persons or jurisdictions.\nNonetheless, there can be no guarantee that our compliance program will prevent transactions with particular persons or addresses or prevent every potential violation of OFAC\nsanctions, and our expansion into additional jurisdictions may subject us to additional risks related to use of our services by sanctioned persons.\nFrom time to time, we have submitted voluntary disclosures to OFAC or responded to administrative subpoenas from OFAC. Certain of these voluntary self-disclosures are\ncurrently under review by OFAC. To date, none of those proceedings has resulted in a monetary penalty or finding of violation. Any present or future government inquiries\nrelating to sanctions could result in negative consequences for us, including costs related to government investigations, financial penalties, and harm to our reputation. The\nimpact on us related to such matters could be substantial. Although we have implemented controls and are working to implement additional controls and screening tools\ndesigned to prevent sanctions violations, there is no guarantee that we will not inadvertently provide access to our products and services to sanctioned parties or jurisdictions in\nthe future.\nRegulators worldwide frequently study each other’s approaches to the regulation of the digital financial system. Consequently, developments in any jurisdiction may influence\nother jurisdictions. New developments in one jurisdiction may be extended to additional services and other jurisdictions. As a result, the risks created by any new law or\nregulation in one jurisdiction are magnified by the potential that they may be replicated, affecting our business in another place or involving another service. Conversely, if\nregulations diverge worldwide, we may face difficulty adjusting our products, services, and other aspects of our business with the same effect.\nThe complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes could result in a single event prompting numerous overlapping investigations and\nlegal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities across different jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our\nreputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Due to the uncertain application of existing laws, rules, and\nregulations, it may be that, despite our regulatory and legal analysis concluding that certain products and services are currently unregulated, such products or services may\nindeed be subject to financial regulation, licensing, or authorization obligations that we have not obtained or with which we have not complied. As a result, we are at a\nheightened risk of enforcement action, litigation,\n42\nTable of Contents\nregulatory, and legal scrutiny which could lead to sanctions, cease and desist orders, or other penalties and censures which could significantly and adversely affect our\ncontinued operations and financial condition.\nComplex and evolving U.S. and international laws, rules and regulation regarding privacy and data protection could result in claims, changes to our business practices,\npenalties, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to requirements relating to data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer, and use of data under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws. For example,\nthe FTC routinely investigates the privacy practices of companies and has commenced enforcement actions against many, resulting in multi-million dollar settlements and\nmulti-year agreements governing the settling companies’ privacy practices. The California Consumer Protection Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020, imposes\nheightened data privacy requirements on companies that collect information from California residents. If we are unable to meet any such requirements, we may be subject to\nsignificant fines or penalties. As the number of jurisdictions enacting privacy and related laws increases and the scope of these laws and enforcement efforts expands, we will\nincreasingly become subject to new and varying requirements. Failure to comply with existing or future data privacy laws, rules, regulations and requirements, including by\nreason of inadvertent disclosure of personal information, could result in significant adverse consequences, including reputational harm, civil litigation, regulatory enforcement,\ncosts of remediation, increased expenses for security systems and personnel, and harm to our users. These consequences could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we make information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies in connection with regulatory requirements to assist\nin the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations. In recent years, we have experienced increasing data sharing\nrequests by these agencies, particularly in connection with efforts to prevent terrorist financing or reduce the risk of identity theft. During the same period, there has also been\nincreased public attention to the corporate use and disclosure of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection,\ninformation security, and consumer privacy. These regulatory goals may conflict, and the law in these areas may not be consistent or settled. While we believe that we are\ncompliant with our regulatory responsibilities, the legal, political, and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation, regulation,\nlitigation, court rulings or other events could expose us to increased program costs, liability and reputational damage that could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these\nlaws could result in material settlements, fines, penalties, and increased operating costs, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe are considered a money services business in the U.S. under the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. As such, we are subject to reporting,\nrecordkeeping and anti-money laundering provisions in the U.S. as well as other jurisdictions. Many of these laws are evolving, with requirements that may be unclear and\ninconsistent across jurisdictions, making compliance challenging. Subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could expose us to increased\nprogram costs, liability and reputational damage. During 2017 and 2018, there were significant regulatory reviews and actions taken by U.S. and other regulators and law\nenforcement agencies against banks, money services businesses and other financial institutions related to money laundering. We are also subject to regulatory oversight and\nenforcement by FinCEN. Any determination that we have violated any anti-money-laundering laws could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe are also subject to regulations imposed by the FCPA in the U.S. and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. To the extent we expand our non-U.S. operations, we\ncould experience a higher risk associated with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws than other companies. Since 2016, there has been an increase in regulatory reviews and\nenforcement actions taken by the U.S. and other regulators related to antibribery laws, along with increased scrutiny on payments to and relationships with, foreign entities and\nindividuals. Any investigation or negative finding in connection with such laws could result in significant fines or internal compliance cost, and could also harm our reputation,\nwhich would result in a negative impact on our business.\nFuture developments in tax laws or regulations regarding the treatment and reporting of cryptocurrencies for U.S. and foreign tax purposes could adversely impact our tax\nexpense and liabilities, reporting obligations, liquidity, and business.\nDue to the new and evolving nature of cryptocurrencies and the absence of comprehensive legal and tax guidance with respect to digital asset products and transactions, many\nsignificant aspects of the U.S. and foreign tax treatment of transactions involving cryptocurrencies, such as the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, are uncertain, and it is\nunclear whether, when and what guidance may be issued in the future on the treatment of digital asset transactions for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIn 2014, the IRS released Notice 2014-21, discussing certain aspects of “virtual currency” for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in particular, stating that such virtual\ncurrency (i) is “property,” (ii) is not “currency” for purposes of the rules relating to foreign currency gain or loss, and (iii) may be held as a capital asset. In 2019, the IRS\nreleased Revenue Ruling 2019-24 and a set of “Frequently Asked Questions” (which have been periodically updated), that provide additional guidance, including guidance to\nthe effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital currencies are taxable events giving rise to ordinary income and guidance with respect to the determination of\nthe tax basis of virtual currency. However, this guidance does not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of cryptocurrencies and related\ntransactions.\nThere continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing, character and amount of income inclusions for various digital asset transactions. Although we believe our treatment\nof digital asset transactions for federal income tax purposes is consistent with existing guidance provided by the IRS and existing U.S. federal income tax principles, because of\nthe rapidly evolving nature of digital asset innovations and the increasing variety and complexity of digital asset transactions and products, it is possible the IRS and various\nU.S. states may disagree with our treatment of certain digital asset transactions for U.S. tax purposes, which could adversely affect our users and our business. Similar\nuncertainties exist in the foreign markets in which we operate, affecting our non-U.S. user base, and these uncertainties and potential adverse interpretations of tax law could\naffect our non-U.S. users and the vitality of our platforms outside of the U.S. There can be no assurance that the IRS, the U.S. state revenue agencies or other foreign tax\nauthorities, will not alter their respective positions with respect to cryptocurrencies in the future or that a court would uphold the treatment set forth in existing guidance. It also\nis unclear what additional guidance may be issued in the future on the treatment of existing digital asset transactions and future digital asset innovations for purposes of U.S. tax\nor other foreign tax regulations. Any such alteration of existing IRS, U.S. state and foreign tax authority positions or additional guidance regarding digital asset products and\ntransactions could result in adverse tax consequences for holders of cryptocurrencies and could have an adverse effect on the value of cryptocurrencies and the broader\ncryptocurrency markets. Future technological and operational developments that may arise with respect to cryptocurrencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the\ntreatment of cryptocurrency for U.S. and foreign tax purposes. The uncertainty regarding tax treatment of digital asset transactions impacts our users, and could adversely\nimpact our business, including if the volume of cryptocurrency transactions decreases due to adverse tax effect.\nThe ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a military action in Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely. Although the length, impact\nand outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, this conflict could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant\nvolatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, increases in inflation and interest rates, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and\nsocial instability, labor shortages, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increase in cyberattacks and espionage.\nThe situation is rapidly evolving and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries may implement additional sanctions, export controls or\nother measures against Russia, Belarus and other countries, regions, officials, individuals or industries in the respective territories. Such sanctions and other measures, as well as\nthe existing and potential further responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, could adversely affect the global economy and\nfinancial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and assessing its impact on our business. To date we have not experienced any material interruptions in our infrastructure,\nsupplies, technology systems or networks needed to support our operations. We are unable to predict the progress or outcome of the conflict in Ukraine or its impacts in\nUkraine, Russia or Belarus as the conflict, and any resulting government reactions, are rapidly developing and beyond our control. The extent and duration of the military\naction, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have a substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown\nperiod of time. Any of the above mentioned factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact\nof other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Third Parties\nWe currently rely on third-party service providers and their systems for certain aspects of our operations, and any interruptions in services provided by these third parties\nmay impair our ability to support our users.\nWe rely on third parties and their systems in connection with many aspects of our business, including our kiosk manufacturers, our retail partners, logistics providers, and\nbanks; cloud computing services and data centers that provide facilities, infrastructure, website functionality and access, components, and services, including databases and data\ncenter facilities and cloud computing; as well as third parties that provide outsourced user service, compliance support and product development functions, which are critical to\nour operations. Because we rely on third parties to provide these services and systems and to facilitate certain of our business activities,\n44\nTable of Contents\nwe face increased operational risks. We do not directly manage the operation of any of these third parties, including their data center facilities that we use. These third parties\nmay be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, theft, acts of vandalism,\nprivacy breaches, service terminations, disruptions, interruptions, and other misconduct. They are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, power loss,\ntelecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and similar events. For example, on February\n24, 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s payments network experienced an outage, which had the potential to result in reduced functionality for certain of our products. In addition,\nthese third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these\nagreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of\nour services, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our users, or give preferential treatment to competitors. There can be no assurance that third parties that provide\nservices to us or to our users on our behalf will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or\nsystems or perform their responsibilities to us or our users on our behalf, such as if third-party service providers close their data center facilities without adequate notice, are\nunable to restore operations and data, fail to perform as expected, or experience other unanticipated problems, we may be unable to procure alternatives in a timely and efficient\nmanner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, user dissatisfaction, reputational\ndamage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our business.\nMany of our kiosks and key components to these kiosks are procured from a single or limited number of suppliers. Thus, we are at risk of shortage, price increases, tariffs,\nchanges, delay, or discontinuation of these kiosks or components, which could disrupt and materially and adversely affect our business.\nDue to our reliance on the components or products produced by certain of our suppliers, we are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times or other disruptions in the\nsupply of certain components or products. Our ongoing efforts to identify alternative manufacturers for the assembly of our products and for many of the single-sourced\ncomponents used in our products may not be successful. In the case of off-the-shelf and other hardware components of our kiosk-based equipment, we are subject to the risk\nthat our suppliers may discontinue or modify them, or that the components may cease to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We have in the past\nexperienced, and may in the future experience, component shortages or delays or other problems in product assembly, and the availability of these components or products may\nbe difficult to predict. For example, our manufacturers may experience temporary or permanent disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns,\nlabor strikes or shortages, natural disasters, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, component or material shortages, cost increases, acquisitions, insolvency,\nbankruptcy, business shutdowns, trade restrictions, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, or other similar problems. The current global supply chain disruptions and\nshortages, in particular with respect to integrated circuits, have affected our supply chain and resulted in low levels of inventory for some of our hardware products. Therefore,\nour suppliers may be unable to timely fulfill orders for some hardware products. These hardware shortages could negatively affect our ability to deploy our kiosks and serve our\nusers, and if such shortages continue for an extended period of time, could materially and adversely impact our financial results.\nAdditionally, various sources of supply-chain risk, including strikes or shutdowns at delivery ports or loss of or damage to our products while they are in transit or storage,\nintellectual property theft, losses due to tampering, third- party vendor issues with quality or sourcing control, failure by our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and\nregulation, potential tariffs or other trade restrictions, or other similar problems could limit or delay the supply of our products or harm our reputation. In the event of a shortage\nor supply interruption from suppliers of these components, such as the current global shortage of integrated circuits, we may not be able to develop alternate sources quickly,\ncost-effectively, or at all. Any interruption or delay in manufacturing, component supply, any increases in component costs (or prices charged by our vendors generally), or the\ninability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would harm our ability to provide our products\nand services to users. This could harm our relationships with our users and retail partners, prevent us from acquiring new users and merchants, and materially and adversely\naffect our business.\nA substantial portion of our kiosks are placed with a small number of retailers today. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of any of these contracts with our top\nretail partners or if one or more of our top retail partners were to cease doing business with us or substantially reduce its dealings with us, could cause our revenues to\ndecline significantly and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we derived approximately 27% and 32.0%, respectively, of our total revenue from kiosks placed at the locations of our largest\nretail partner, Circle K, under individual corporate and franchisee lease agreements.\nBecause a significant portion of our kiosks are placed with a small number of retailers, a portion of our future revenues and operating income depends upon the successful\ncontinuation of our relationship with our top retail partners and the loss of any of our largest retail\n45\nTable of Contents\npartners, a decision by any one of them to reduce the number of our kiosks placed in their locations, or a decision to sell or close their locations could result in a decline in our\nrevenues or otherwise adversely impact our business operations. Furthermore, if their financial conditions were to deteriorate in the future, and as a result, one or more of these\nretail partners were required to close a significant number of their store locations, our revenues would be significantly impacted.\nAdditionally, these retail partners may elect not to renew their contracts when they expire. Even if our major contracts are extended or renewed, the renewal terms may be less\nfavorable to us than the current contracts. If any of our largest retail partners enters bankruptcy proceedings and rejects its contract with us, fails to renew its contract upon\nexpiration, or if the renewal terms with any of them are less favorable to us than under our current contracts, it could result in a decline in our revenues and profits and have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Management and Employees\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex\nlaws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant\nregulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and\nconstituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could\nadversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could adversely impact our business,\noperating results, and financial condition.\nWe operate in a relatively new industry that is not widely understood and requires highly skilled and technical personnel. We believe that our future success is highly dependent\non the talents and contributions of our senior management team, members of our executive team, and other key employees across product, engineering, risk management,\nfinance, compliance and legal, and marketing. Our future success depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Due to\nthe nascent nature of the digital financial system, the pool of qualified talent is extremely limited, particularly with respect to executive talent, engineering, risk management,\nand financial regulatory expertise. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous software and other technology companies. To attract and retain key\npersonnel, we incur significant costs, including salaries and benefits and equity incentives. Even so, these measures may not be enough to attract and retain the personnel we\nrequire to operate our business effectively. The loss of even a few key employees or senior leaders, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled\nemployees required for the planned expansion of our business could adversely impact our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\nOur officers, directors, employees, and large stockholders may encounter potential conflicts of interests with respect to their positions or interests in cryptocurrencies,\nentities, and other initiatives and digital asset-related businesses, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nCertain of our officers, directors, and employees are involved with or active investors in certain digital asset-related businesses, such as cryptocurrency miners, as well as active\ninvestors in digital asset projects themselves, and may make investment decisions that favor projects that they have personally invested in. Our largest stockholders may also\nmake investments in these digital asset projects. Similarly, certain of our directors, officers, employees, and large stockholders may hold cryptocurrencies that we are\nconsidering supporting, and may be more supportive of such listing notwithstanding legal, regulatory, and other issues associated with such cryptocurrencies. While we have\ninstituted policies and procedures to limit and mitigate such risks, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective, or that we will be able to manage\nsuch conflicts of interests adequately. If we fail to manage these conflicts of interests, or we receive unfavorable media coverage with respect to actual or perceived conflicts of\ninterest, our business may be harmed and the brand, reputation and credibility of our company may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Organizational Structure and the Tax Receivable Agreement\nWe are a holding company. Our sole material asset is our interests in BT HoldCo, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from BT HoldCo to pay taxes, make\npayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and cover our corporate and other overhead expenses.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of equity interests in BT HoldCo. As such, we do not have any independent means of\ngenerating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay taxes and operating expenses or declare and\n46\nTable of Contents\npay dividends in the future, if any, is dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of BT HoldCo and its subsidiaries (including BT OpCo), and distributions we receive\nfrom BT HoldCo.\nBT HoldCo is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally will not be subject to entity-level U.S. federal income taxation. Instead,\ntaxable income will be allocated to the unitholders of BT HoldCo. Furthermore, BT OpCo is disregarded as an entity separate from BT HoldCo for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Accordingly, we are required to pay income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of BT HoldCo, which includes income of BT OpCo. To the extent\nBT HoldCo has available cash, we generally intend to cause BT HoldCo to make pro rata distributions to its unitholders, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow\nus to cover our tax obligations, to satisfy our payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and to cover our corporate and other overhead expenses. There can be\nno assurance that BT HoldCo and its subsidiaries (including BT OpCo) will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us, or that applicable state law and contractual\nrestrictions, including negative covenants in any financing agreements of BT HoldCo or its subsidiaries (including BT OpCo), will permit such distributions. To the extent that\nwe need funds and BT HoldCo or its subsidiaries (including BT OpCo) are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or under the terms of any financing\nagreements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and, as a result, we qualify for, and currently and may in the future rely on, certain exemptions\nfrom Nasdaq’s corporate governance requirements. As such, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such\nrequirements.\nBecause Brandon Mintz (through his ownership interests in BT Assets) owns a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we qualify as a “controlled\ncompany” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq rules, a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held\nby another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the\nrequirements that:\n•a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n•the nominating and corporate governance committee of the Board be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s\npurpose and responsibilities;\n•the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and\n•there be an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nThese requirements will not apply to us as long as we remain a controlled company. We currently rely on two of these exemptions. As a result, we will not have a fully\nindependent compensation committee or a fully independent nominating and corporate governance committee. We may in the future also rely on the other exemptions so long as\nwe qualify as a controlled company. To the extent we rely on any of these exemptions, holders of shares of Class A common stock will not have the same protections afforded\nto stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\nBrandon Mintz and his affiliates (including BT Assets) own a substantial majority of the common stock and have the right to appoint a majority of our board members, and\nhis interests may conflict with those of other stockholders.\nHolders of our voting stock will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable\nlaw or the Amended and Restated Charter. As a result of BT Assets’ majority ownership, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq corporate governance\nstandards and BT Assets will be able to substantially influence matters requiring stockholder or board approval, including the election of directors, approval of any potential\nacquisition of us, changes to our organizational documents, significant corporate transactions, and certain decisions we make with respect to directing the manager of BT\nHoldCo. In particular, for so long as BT Assets continues to own a majority of our voting stock, Brandon Mintz, through BT Assets, will be able to substantially influence\nmatters requiring stockholder or board approval, including the election of directors, approval of any potential acquisition of us, changes to our organizational documents,\nsignificant corporate transactions, and certain board decisions with respect to the management of BT HoldCo. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other\nholder or group of holders of common stock or Preferred Stock will be able to affect the way we and BT HoldCo are managed or the direction of our business. Furthermore, the\nconcentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of Class A common stock as part of a sale of us and ultimately might\nadversely affect the trading price of the Class A common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder. The\ninterests of BT Assets and Brandon Mintz with respect to matters potentially or actually involving\n47\nTable of Contents\nor affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings, and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFor example, the interests of BT Assets may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders in light of the Tax Receivable Agreement and its ownership of the BT HoldCo\nPreferred Units. In particular, BT Assets’ right to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could influence its decisions regarding whether and when to support\nthe disposition of assets, the incurrence or refinancing of new or existing indebtedness, the timing or amount of distributions by BT HoldCo or the termination of the Tax\nReceivable Agreement and acceleration of our obligations thereunder. The determination of future tax reporting positions, the structuring of future transactions and the handling\nof any challenge by any taxing authority to our tax reporting positions may take into consideration tax or other interests of BT Assets, including the effect of such positions on\nour obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and with respect to the amount of tax distributions, which may differ from our interests or the interests of our other\nstockholders. In addition, BT Assets’ ownership of the BT HoldCo Preferred Units and the right to receive distributions pursuant thereto could influence decisions regarding the\ntiming or amount of distributions by BT HoldCo, and BT Assets’ interests in connection with such matters may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. These\ndecisions could adversely affect our liquidity or financial condition.\nWe are required to make payments to BT Assets under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain Tax Attributes, and no such payments will be made to any party other\nthan BT Assets. The amounts of such payments could be significant.\nIn connection with the closing of the Merger, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with BT HoldCo and BT Assets. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are\ngenerally required to pay BT Assets 85% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes that we actually realize, or in certain\ncircumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of certain Tax Attributes, including:\n•existing tax basis in certain assets of BT HoldCo and BT OpCo, including assets that will eventually be subject to depreciation or amortization, once placed in\nservice, attributable to BT HoldCo Common Units acquired by us in connection with the closing of the Merger and thereafter in accordance with the terms of the BT\nHoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement;\n•tax basis adjustments resulting from our acquisition of BT HoldCo Common Units from BT Assets at the closing of the Merger and thereafter pursuant to the terms\nof the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (including any such adjustments resulting from certain payments made by us under\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement);\n•disproportionate tax-related allocations as a result of Section 704(c) of the Code; and\n•tax deductions in respect of interest payments deemed to be made by us in connection with the Tax Receivable Agreement (collectively, “Tax Attributes”).\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are our obligations and not obligations of BT HoldCo. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will\ngenerally be treated as realizing a tax benefit from the use of a Tax Attribute on a “with and without” basis, by comparing our actual tax liability to the amount we would have\nbeen required to pay had we not been able to utilize any of the Tax Attributes. The amounts payable, as well as the timing of any payments, under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement are dependent upon significant future events, including (but not limited to) the timing of the exchanges of BT HoldCo Common Units and surrender of a\ncorresponding number of shares of Class V common stock, the price of the Class A common stock at the time of each exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable\ntransactions, the depreciation and amortization periods that apply to any increase in tax basis resulting from such exchanges, the types of assets held by BT HoldCo and BT\nOpCo, the amount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rate then applicable and the portion of our payments under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine (with the amount of subject payments determined in\nconsultation with an advisory firm and subject to BT Assets’ review and consent). The IRS or another taxing authority may challenge all or any part of a position taken with\nrespect to Tax Attributes or the utilization thereof, as well as other tax positions that we take, and a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event that any Tax Attributes\ninitially claimed or utilized by us are disallowed, BT Assets will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made pursuant to the\nTax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, any excess payments made to BT Assets will be applied\nagainst and reduce any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by us to BT Assets under the Tax Receivable Agreement, after the determination of such excess.\nHowever, a challenge to any Tax Attributes initially claimed or utilized by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. Moreover, even if\na challenge arises earlier, any such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms\nof the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, there might not\n48\nTable of Contents\nbe future cash payments against which such excess can be applied and we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual\nsavings in respect of the Tax Attributes, which could materially impair our financial condition.\nWe expect that the payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be substantial. There can be no assurance that we will be able to\nfinance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Moreover, the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be conditioned upon BT Assets having a\ncontinued ownership interest in us.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize, if any, in respect of the Tax\nAttributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in the case of certain early termination events (including certain changes of control, material breaches, or at our option subject to\nthe approval of a majority of our independent directors), we will be required to make a lump-sum cash payment to BT Assets equal to the present value of all forecasted future\npayments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including that we will\nhave sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize the Tax Attributes over certain specified time periods and that all BT HoldCo Common Units that had not yet been\nexchanged for Class A common stock, Class M common stock, or cash are deemed exchanged.\nAccordingly, as a result of these assumptions, the required lump-sum payment may be significantly in advance of, and could materially exceed, the realized future tax benefits\nto which the payment relates. Consequently, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a material and adverse impact on Bitcoin Depot’s liquidity and\nfinancial condition and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control.\nFor example, in connection with the preparation of the proxy statement filed in connection with the Business Combination, we previously estimated that, if we had experienced a\nchange of control or the Tax Receivable Agreement had otherwise been terminated immediately after the closing of the Merger, the estimated lump-sum payment would have\nbeen approximately $90.2 million. This estimated lump-sum payment was based on certain assumptions and was calculated using a discount rate equal to the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate plus 100 basis points, applied against an undiscounted liability of approximately $134.6 million (based on the 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and an\nestimated state and local income tax rate). These amounts are estimates and were prepared for informational purposes only. The actual amount of such lump-sum payment could\nvary significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance such lump-sum payment. In addition, to the extent that we are unable to make such lump-sum\npayment for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.\nIn the event that our payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are accelerated upon certain changes of control, the consideration payable to holders of\nClass A common stock could be substantially reduced.\nIf we experience a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement), our obligation to make the lump-sum payment required under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement could result in holders of Class A common stock receiving substantially less consideration in connection with a change of control transaction than they would\nreceive in the absence of such obligation. Further, BT Assets is not required to have a continued equity interest in us or BT HoldCo in order to receive payments under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement and therefore may not have an equity interest in us at the time of any such change of control. Accordingly, the interests of BT Assets may conflict with\nthose of the holders of Class A common stock.\nIf BT HoldCo were to become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and BT HoldCo might be subject to\npotentially significant tax inefficiencies, and we would not be able to recover payments previously made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement even if the\ncorresponding Tax Attributes were subsequently determined to have been unavailable due to such status.\nWe and BT HoldCo intend to operate such that BT HoldCo does not become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A\n“publicly traded partnership” is a partnership the interests of which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial\nequivalent thereof. Under certain circumstances, exchanges of BT HoldCo Common Units pursuant to the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company\nAgreement or other transfers of BT HoldCo Common Units could cause BT HoldCo to be treated as a publicly traded partnership. Applicable U.S. Treasury regulations provide\nfor certain safe harbors from treatment as a publicly traded partnership, and we intend to operate such that exchanges or other transfers of BT HoldCo Common Units qualify for\none or more such safe harbors.\nIf BT HoldCo were to become a publicly traded partnership, significant tax inefficiencies might result for us and for BT HoldCo, including as a result of our inability to file a\nconsolidated U.S. federal income tax return with BT HoldCo. In addition, we would no longer receive the benefit of certain increases in tax basis received as a result of our\nacquisition of BT HoldCo Common Units from BT Assets, and we would not be able to recover any payments previously made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement,\neven if\n49\nTable of Contents\nthe corresponding Tax Attributes were subsequently determined to have been unavailable due to BT HoldCo’s status as a publicly traded partnership.\nIn certain circumstances, BT HoldCo will be required to make tax distributions to the BT HoldCo unitholders (including us) and the tax distributions that BT HoldCo will\nbe required to make may be substantial. To the extent we receive tax distributions in excess of our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement and do not distribute such cash balances as dividends on shares of Class A common stock, BT Assets could benefit from such accumulated cash balances if it\nexchanges its BT HoldCo Common Units pursuant to the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement.\nBT HoldCo is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will\ngenerally be allocated to the BT HoldCo unitholders (including us). The BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement requires tax distributions be\nmade by BT HoldCo to the BT HoldCo unitholders (including us), on a pro rata basis, to the extent funds of BT HoldCo are legally available for distribution and such\ndistribution would not be prohibited under any credit facility or any other agreement to which BT HoldCo or any of its subsidiaries is a party, in each case, as determined by us\nin our reasonable discretion. Tax distributions will be made on a quarterly basis to each unitholder based on such unitholder’s allocable share of the taxable income of BT\nHoldCo and an assumed tax rate (and, in our case, taking into account our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement). The assumed tax rate will be the highest combined\nfederal, state, and local tax rate that may potentially apply to a corporate or individual taxpayer (whichever is higher), taking into account certain assumptions and without\nregard to the actual final tax liability of any unitholder.\nAs a result of (i) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and to BT Assets, (ii) the lower maximum tax rate applicable to corporations than\nindividuals, and (iii) the use of an assumed tax rate in calculating BT HoldCo’s tax distribution obligations, we may receive distributions significantly in excess of our actual tax\nliabilities and our obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We will have no obligation to distribute such cash balances to our stockholders. If we do\nnot distribute such cash balances as dividends on shares of Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances or lend them to BT HoldCo, BT Assets\nwould benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances as a result of its right to acquire shares of Class A common stock, Class M common stock or, at our\nelection, an amount of cash equal to the fair market value thereof, in exchange for its BT HoldCo Common Units.\nIf we are deemed an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as\ncontemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn issuer will generally be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the Investment Company Act if:\n•it is an “orthodox” investment company because it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing,\nreinvesting, or trading in securities; or\n•it is an inadvertent investment company because, absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40%\nof the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nWe believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of operating BTMs that allow users to purchase Bitcoin with cash and not primarily in the business of investing,\nreinvesting, or trading in securities. We do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that\nBT Assets is, or that BT OpCo, BT HoldCo, or Bitcoin Depot will be, an “orthodox” investment company as described in the first bullet point above. Furthermore, Bitcoin\nDepot will treat each of BT OpCo and BT HoldCo as a majority-owned subsidiary for purposes of the Investment Company Act. Therefore, we believe that less than 40% of\nour total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis following the closing of the Merger comprise assets that could be\nconsidered investment securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that Bitcoin Depot, BT HoldCo, or BT OpCo will be an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40%\ninadvertent investment company test as described in the second bullet point above. In addition, we believe we will not be an investment company under section 3(b)(1) of the\nInvestment Company Act because we will be primarily engaged in a non-investment company business.\nThe Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operations of investment companies. Among other things, the\nInvestment Company Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the\nissuance of stock options, and impose certain governance requirements. Following the closing of the Merger, we have continued and intend to continue to conduct our\noperations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if anything were to happen that would cause us to be\ndeemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, requirements imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure,\nability to transact business with affiliates (including BT HoldCo and BT\n50\nTable of Contents\nOpCo) and ability to compensate key employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements\nbetween and among BT OpCo, us or our senior management team, or any combination thereof and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and\napplicable provisions of Delaware law.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent upon the ability of BT OpCo to generate earnings and cash flows and distribute them to us (through BT HoldCo) so that we may pay\nour obligations and expenses (including our taxes and payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement) and pay to our stockholders any dividends that our board of directors\nmay declare, in its sole discretion, in the future. See “—We are not obligated to, and do not intend to pay dividends on any class of our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure, our financing\narrangements and applicable provisions of Delaware law.” We expect to cause BT HoldCo to make distributions to its members. However, the ability of BT HoldCo to make\nsuch distributions to holders of its BT HoldCo Common Units is subject to its operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, restrictive covenants in our debt\ninstruments, preferential distributions to the holders of the BT HoldCo Preferred Units, and applicable Delaware law (which may limit the amount of funds available for\ndistribution to its members). Our ability to declare and pay dividends to our stockholders is likewise subject to Delaware law (which may limit the amount of funds available for\ndividends). If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we are unable to generate sufficient distributions from our business, we may not be able to make,\nor may be required to reduce or eliminate, the payment of future dividends, if any, on Class A common stock or Class M common stock.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe are party to debt agreements (and we may in the future become party to new debt agreements) that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness will impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that, in turn, could impair\nour ability to meet our obligations under our debt.\nThe agreements governing our Term Loan include restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n•incur additional debt;\n•pay dividends and make distributions;\n•make certain investments;\n•repurchase equity interests and prepay certain indebtedness;\n•create liens;\n•enter into transactions with affiliates;\n•modify the nature of our business;\n•transfer and sell assets, including material intellectual property;\n•enter into agreements prohibiting our ability to grant liens in favor of our senior secured creditors;\n•amend or modify the terms of any junior financing arrangements;\n•amend our organizational documents; and\n•merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate.\nIn addition, our Term Loan includes other restrictions. Our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the\ngoverning documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our total indebtedness, excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of $3.2 million, was $24.3 million, including the accrual for the\ncurrent note payable exit fee. In connection with the consummation of the Merger, we amended and restated our existing credit agreement, which provided BT OpCo with a\n$20.8 million term loan. We may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. See Note 25 - Subsequent Events in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOur substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:\n•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;\n•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to fund payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations and\nother purposes;\n•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n•making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and\n•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and financial commitments.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness and financial commitments depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which\nare subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions including financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash\nflow to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional\ncapital or restructure our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at\nsuch time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our\noperations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to service our debt would likely\nresult in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we face substantial liquidity problems, we might be required to sell\nassets to meet debt and other obligations. Our debt restricts our ability to dispose of assets and dictates our use of the proceeds from such disposition.\nWe may not be able to consummate dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may be inadequate to meet obligations. We may be unable to access adequate\nfunding as a result of a decrease in lender commitments due to an unwillingness or inability on the part of lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations and the\ninability of other lenders to provide additional funding to cover a defaulting lender’s portion. As a result, we may be unable to execute our business plan, make acquisitions or\notherwise conduct operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nWe require continued access to capital. Our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of, and cost of capital, increases in interest\nrates, or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow, and\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage. Recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting\nour ability to finance our operations. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and could decline significantly and rapidly. Market volatility may affect the value of an investment in our\nClass A common stock and could subject us to litigation.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and others\nbeyond our control, including:\n•the number of shares of Class A common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n•overall performance of the equity markets or publicly-listed financial services, cryptocurrency and technology companies;\n•our actual or anticipated operating performance and the operating performance of our competitors;\n52\nTable of Contents\n•changes in the projected operational and financial results we provide to the public or our failure to meet those projections;\n•failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to\nmeet the estimates or the expectations of investors;\n•any major change in our board of directors, management or key personnel;\n•issuance of shares of Class A common stock;\n•the highly volatile nature of the digital financial system and the prices of cryptocurrencies;\n•rumors and market speculation involving the digital financial system or us or other companies in our industry;\n•announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, new products, services, features, integrations or capabilities, acquisitions, strategic investments,\npartnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; and\n•other events or factors, including those resulting from COVID-19, political instability, and acts of war, or terrorism, or responses to these events, including the\ncurrent conflict in Ukraine.\nFurthermore, the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of\nmany companies and financial services, cryptocurrency and technology companies in particular. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the\noperating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general macroeconomic, political and market conditions such as recessions,\ninterest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced\nvolatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our\nmanagement’s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nAn active, liquid trading market for our Class A common stock may not develop or be sustained, which may adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nUpon the closing of the Merger, our Class A common stock commenced trading on Nasdaq under the symbol “BTM.” An active trading market for our shares may not develop\nor be sustained, which in turn would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of our Class A common stock. The market price of our Class A common stock may\ndecline below the initial public offering price, and you may not be able to sell your shares of our Class A common stock at or above the price you paid, or at all. An inactive\nmarket may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by\nusing our shares as consideration.\nThe class structure of our Common Stock has the effect of concentrating voting control within Brandon Mintz and his affiliates (including BT Assets), which limits or\nprecludes your ability to influence corporate matters.\nShares of Class M common stock and Class V common stock each have ten votes per share, and shares of Class A common stock and Class O common stock each have one\nvote per share. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between the Class M common stock and the Class V common stock, on the one hand, and all other classes of our voting\nstock, on the other hand, the holder(s) of Class V common stock collectively holds more than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, and therefore such\nholders are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. In the event Brandon Mintz and his affiliates (including, without limitation, BT Assets) cease\nto beneficially own in the aggregate (directly or indirectly) a number of shares of Class M common stock and Class V common stock that, in the aggregate, is at least 20% of\nthe voting power represented by the shares of Class V common stock held by them, in the aggregate, as of immediately after the closing, (i) each of the then-outstanding shares\nof Class M common stock will automatically convert, on a one-for-one basis, into one fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A common stock and (ii) each of the then-\noutstanding shares of Class V common stock will automatically convert, on a one-for-one basis, into one fully paid and non-assessable share of Class O common stock, in each\ncase without any further action required on the part of Bitcoin Depot or any other person.\nAny purported transfer or assignment of shares of Class O common stock or Class V common stock which is not permitted by or otherwise provided for under the Amended\nand Restated Charter will be null and void and not recognized or given effect. Transfers by holders of shares of Class M common stock will generally result in those shares\nconverting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Such conversions of shares of Class M common stock to shares of Class A common stock upon transfer will\nhave the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those other holders of shares of Class M common stock (if any) who retain their shares in the long-term.\nHowever, because of the nature of the relative voting power of classes of our common stock, the\n53\nTable of Contents\nholders of Class V common stock and Class M common stock, notwithstanding conversions of shares thereof conversions, may continue to control a majority of the combined\nvoting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nWe are not obligated to, and do not intend to pay dividends on any class of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders\nwill be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure, our financing arrangements and applicable provisions of\nDelaware law.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of common stock, are not obligated to pay, and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable\nfuture. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any\ndetermination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Our payment of any dividends will be subject to contractual and legal restrictions\nand other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nOur Amended and Restated Charter contains an exclusive forum provision for certain claims, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial\nforum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Charter provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we provide consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other\nstate courts of the State of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of\nbreach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant\nto any provision of the DGCL, our Amended and Restated Charter or our Amended and Restated Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery\nof the State of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, provided that this provision, including for any “derivative action,” will not\napply to suits to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nMoreover, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and the Amended and Restated Charter provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America are, to the\nfullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, unless we consent in writing to the\nselection of an alternative forum. Our decision to adopt an exclusive forum provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such\nprovisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or\ndetermine that the exclusive forum provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the exclusive forum provision means that suits brought by our stockholders\nto enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates\nexclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. The exclusive forum\nprovision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by law. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to\nenforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have\nwaived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities will be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum\nprovisions. These provisions may limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other\nemployees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision\ncontained in the Amended and Restated Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Amended and Restated Charter, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and provisions of Delaware law could impair a takeover\nattempt.\nOur Amended and Restated Charter, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or\npreventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors and therefore depress the trading price of shares of Class A common stock. Among other things, the\nclass structure of our common stock provides holders of Class M common stock and Class V common stock with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters\nrequiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Further, our Amended and Restated Charter\nand Amended and Restated Bylaws include provisions (i) providing our directors with the exclusive ability (subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock) to\nfill a vacancy on the board of directors; (ii) authorizing our\n54\nTable of Contents\nboard of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used, among other things, to institute a rights\nplan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our\nboard of directors; (iii) after we no longer qualify as a “controlled company” under applicable Nasdaq listing rules, limiting stockholders’ ability (a) to call special meetings of\nstockholders, (b) to require special meetings of stockholders to be called and (c) to take action by written consent; (iv) requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for\nbusiness to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; and (v) not permitting cumulative voting\nrights. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we would normally be subject to certain provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which prevents certain stockholders\nholding more than 15% of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combinations without the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least\ntwo-thirds of our outstanding voting stock not held by such stockholder. We expressly elect not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL in our Amended and Restated Charter.\nAny provision of our Amended and Restated Charter, Amended and Restated Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could\nlimit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for\nshares of Class A common stock.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This, as well as other future\nsales of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that any such sales may occur, could cause the market price of Class A common stock to drop\nsignificantly, even if our business is doing well, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. Subject to certain limitations and\nexceptions, BT Unitholders may exchange their BT Units, together with shares of Class V common stock or Class O common stock, for shares of Class M common stock or\nClass A common stock, respectively (on a one-for-one basis, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar\ntransactions) and then transfer those shares of Class M common stock (which, in that, case automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock) or sell those shares of\nClass A common stock. This could cause the market price of the Class A common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. Sales of a substantial number\nof shares of Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend\nto sell shares, could reduce the market price of the Class A common stock. We may file additional registration statements to provide for the resale from time to time of restricted\nshares issued in connection with closing of the Merger. As restrictions on resale end and the registration statements are available for use, the market price of the Class A\ncommon stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.\nWarrants will become exercisable for Class A common stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in further\ndilution to our stockholders.\nOutstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 43,848,750 shares of Class A common stock are exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement\ngoverning those securities. These Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants are exercisable for $11.50 per share at any time. To the extent such Warrants are exercised,\nadditional shares of Class A common stock will be issued, which will result in further dilution to the holders of shares of Class A common stock and increase the number of\nshares of Class A common stock eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such Warrants may be\nexercised could adversely affect the market price of shares of Class A common stock.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants except as otherwise set forth herein that: (i) the Company may not elect to redeem the Private Placement\nWarrants; (ii) the Private Placement Warrants (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) may not, subject to\ncertain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by Sponsor; (iii) they may be exercised by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees on a cashless basis; and (iv) the\nPrivate Placement Warrants (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) are entitled to registration rights.\nThe Warrants may not be “in the money” or expire worthless, and we may redeem unexpired Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to\nyou, thereby making your Public Warrants worthless.\nThe exercise price for each Warrant is $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, which is greater than the market price of our Class A common stock, which was $1.90 per share\nbased on the closing price on March 28, 2024. There can be no assurance that the Warrants will be “in the money” prior to their expiration and, as such, the Warrants may\nexpire worthless.\n55\nTable of Contents\nWe also have the ability to redeem outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant,\nprovided that the last reported sale price of Class A common stock for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on\nwhich we send the notice of redemption to the Public Warrant holders equals or exceeds $18.00 per share and provided certain other conditions are met. If and when the Public\nWarrants become redeemable, we may exercise its redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state\nsecurities laws. Redemption of the outstanding Public Warrants could force you (i) to exercise your Public Warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be\ndisadvantageous for you to do so; (ii) to sell your Public Warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your Public Warrants; or (iii) to\naccept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding Public Warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your\nPublic Warrants. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the Public Warrants are “out of the money,” in which case you would lose any potential embedded\nvalue from a subsequent increase in the value of our Class A common stock had your Public Warrants remained outstanding.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of the Class A common stock.\nThe Amended and Restated Charter authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations,\npreferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. On\nJune 30, 2023, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we issued 4,300,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in a private placement to entities affiliated with Shaolin in\nconnection with the previously announced PIPE Financing. As of December 31, 2023, 825,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been converted into Class A common\nstock. Although the Series A Preferred Stock do not carry voting rights (other than in relation to amendments to the certificate of designation itself or as required by the DGCL),\nthe terms of one or more additional classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might\ngrant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions.\nSimilarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the Class A common\nstock.\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock (i) ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividends, distributions, redemptions, and payments upon liquidation or\ndissolution, (ii) is entitled to participate in any distributions or dividends made to holders of Class A common stock, (iii) does not have voting rights (other than in relation to\namendments to the certificate of designation itself or as required by the DGCL), (iv) is initially convertible at any time at the election of the holder into one share of Class A\ncommon stock, subject to accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, and (v) be entitled to customary anti-dilution protections.\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If it is unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately report its financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence and\nmaterially and adversely affect its business and operating results, and it may face litigation as a result.\nIn connection with the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, management of the Company identified material weaknesses in\nits internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses had not been remediated as of December 31, 2023 and additional material weaknesses have been identified\nas of December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable\npossibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. The material weaknesses\nidentified related to (i) the fact that the Company did not have formalized system of internal control over financial reporting in place to ensure that risks are properly assessed,\ncontrols are properly designed and implemented and internal controls are properly monitored and functioning, (ii) the Company's reliance on IT systems and the use of service\norganizations to initiate, process, and record transactions, for which it did not evaluate or test the respective control objectives and data provided by the service organizations,\nand did not maintain a sufficient complement of formally documented general IT controls over access, segregation of duties, security, and change management, (iii) the\nCompany’s lack of technical accounting resources to analyze and apply technical accounting considerations, (iv) the Company having insufficient controls in place to prevent\npotential unauthorized activity related to cryptocurrencies, and (v) ineffective reconciliation controls over cash in transit. Management of the Company has concluded that these\nmaterial weaknesses arose because, as a private company, the Company did not have the necessary business processes, personnel and related internal controls necessary to\nsatisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud, and material weaknesses could limit the ability to prevent or detect a\nmisstatement of accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements. To address the material weaknesses, the Company\nwill need to add personnel as well as implement\n56\nTable of Contents\nadditional financial reporting processes. Management of the Company intends to continue to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above through hiring\nadditional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel, further enhancing their accounting processes, and by monitoring the respective controls. Management will not\nbe able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and the controls have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. These\nremediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects or that the actions that\nmanagement may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting or that they will prevent or detect potential future material weaknesses. The Company’s current controls and any new controls that management develops may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions in the business and weaknesses in disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm the operating results or cause the\nCompany to fail to meet the reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of the Company’s financial statements for prior periods.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting until after the\nCompany is no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which the internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to\nimplement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent\nregistered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting that will eventually be required to be included in\nBitcoin Depot’s periodic reports that are filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause\ninvestors to lose confidence in Bitcoin Depot’s reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of the Class A common\nstock. In addition, we will not be able to continue to be listed on Nasdaq, which could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of your investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAdverse economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is subject to general economic conditions, and their impact on the digital asset markets and our users. The U.S. and other key international economies have\nexperienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity declined resulting in lower consumption rates, restricted credit, reduced profitability, weaknesses\nin financial markets, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. The impact of general economic conditions on the digital financial system is highly\nuncertain and dependent on a variety of factors, including market adoption of cryptocurrencies, global trends in the digital financial system, central bank monetary policies, and\nother events beyond our control. Geopolitical developments, such as military conflicts and wars, trade wars and foreign exchange limitations can also increase the severity and\nlevels of unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial and digital asset markets. To the extent that conditions in the general economic and\ncryptocurrency markets materially deteriorate, our ability to attract and retain users may suffer.\nInvestors’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social, and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, employees, users and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social,\nand governance (“ESG”) matters, or ESG. Some investors may use these non-financial performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose\nnot to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. The growing investor demand for measurement of non-financial\nperformance is addressed by third-party providers of sustainability assessment and ratings on companies. The criteria by which our corporate responsibility practices are\nassessed may change due to the constant evolution of the sustainability landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to\nsatisfy such new criteria. If we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our policies and actions with respect to corporate social\nresponsibility are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the ESG standards set by various constituencies.\nFurthermore, if our competitors’ corporate social responsibility performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our\ncompetitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement\nof such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, employees, and other\nstakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\n57\nTable of Contents\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics, such as COVID-19, and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as geopolitical conflicts\nand terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may also cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce, and the global economy, and could have an\nadverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, and other\nevents beyond our control. In addition, our non-U.S. operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our\nbusiness and cause our operating results to suffer. For example, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the precautionary measures that we have adopted have\nresulted, and could continue to result, in difficulties or changes to our user support, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could adversely impact our business\nand operating results. Further, acts of terrorism, labor activism or unrest, and other geopolitical conflicts or unrest, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, could\ncause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners or the economy as a whole. In the event of a natural disaster, including a major earthquake, blizzard, or\nhurricane, or a catastrophic event such as a fire, power loss, or telecommunications failure, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions,\nreputational harm, delays in development of our products and services, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could\nhave an adverse effect on our future operating results. We do not maintain insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that could result from\ndisruptions to our services. Additionally, all the aforementioned risks may be further increased if we do not implement a disaster recovery plan or our disaster recovery plans\nprove to be inadequate. To the extent natural disasters or other catastrophic events concurrently impact data centers we rely on in connection with processing transactions, users\nwill experience significant delays in withdrawing funds, or in the extreme we may suffer loss of user funds.\nClimate change could negatively impact our business long-term.\nGlobal climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business continuity and our ability to keep our employees safe and provide for our users and retail\npartners. We consider potential risks related to weather as part of our operations strategy and have business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place. However, they may\nnot adequately protect us from serious disasters and adverse impacts. In addition, climate change events could have an impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and\ninternationally, which has the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of retail partners. They may also cause us to experience higher losses,\nattrition, and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\nWe have operations all over the world and our BTM kiosks in California, Texas and Florida are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. In 2021, the west coast of the\nU.S. experienced historic wildfires; a winter storm in Texas led to massive power outages; and multiple hurricanes formed over the U.S. gulf coast — all of which caused\nsignificant destruction to the affected regions. We anticipate that similar weather events will continue to bring significant annual destruction in vulnerable areas. The long-term\neffects of climate change could have significant repercussions for the global economy and cause significant financial and physical damages.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board\nmembers.\nAs a public company we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. Additionally, we are subject to reporting requirements of the\nExchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, the rules and regulations of the listing standards of Nasdaq, and other applicable\nsecurities rules and regulations. Stockholder activism, the current political and social environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform\nmay lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which has and will likely continue to result in additional compliance costs and could impact the manner in\nwhich we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Compliance with these rules and regulations may strain our financial and management systems, internal\ncontrols, and employees. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results.\nMoreover, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control, over financial reporting. In\norder to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control, over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and\nmanagement oversight may be required. If we encounter material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a\ntimely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Effective internal control is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is\nimportant to prevent fraud.\n58\nTable of Contents\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting\nstandards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nWe are classified as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike\nother public companies, we will not be required to, among other things: (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our\nsystem of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB\nrequiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the\nfinancial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes\non executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years (until January 1, 2027), although we will lose that status sooner if we have more\nthan $1.235 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have $700.0 million or more in market value of Class A common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of\nnon-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nTo the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, you will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies. Additionally, we intend to take advantage of the extended transition periods for the\nadoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under the JOBS Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Our election to use the transition periods\npermitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that\nhave opted out of the extended transition periods permitted under the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards.\nIf some investors find Class A common stock to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Class A common stock and our stock price may be\nmore volatile.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through debt, financing lease arrangements, and revenue generated by our operations. While we believe that our\nexisting cash and cash equivalents and availability under our debt financing agreements are sufficient to meet our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures, and to\nservice our debt, there is no guarantee that this will continue to be true in the future. We cannot be certain when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund\nour ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments in our business to respond to business opportunities and challenges, including\ndeveloping new products and services, enhancing our operating infrastructure, expanding our non-U.S. operations, and acquiring complementary businesses and technologies,\nall of which may require us to secure additional funds. In the future, we may also require additional capital due to refinancing needs, regulatory surety bond requirements, or\nunforeseen circumstances and may decide to engage in equity, equity-linked or debt financings, or enter into additional debt financing agreements for any of the foregoing\nreasons. We may not be able to secure any such additional financing on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all.\nChanges by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of any debt securities of ours as well as our equity securities, and increase our\nborrowing costs. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could\nbe adversely affected. In the event of a downgrade of our credit rating or if other negative action is taken, our ability to obtain additional financing may be adversely affected\nand any future debt offerings or credit arrangements we propose to enter into may be on less favorable terms or terms that may not be acceptable to us. In addition, even if debt\nfinancing is available, the cost of additional financing may be significantly higher than our current debt. If we incur additional debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to\nholders of Class A common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on Class A\ncommon stock. Furthermore, we have authorized the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock. If we issue additional equity securities or other securities convertible into equity,\nincluding convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could experience dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any such securities could have\nrights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our currently authorized and issued Class A common stock.\nThe trading prices for Class A common stock may be highly volatile, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. In addition, a slowdown or\nother sustained adverse downturn in the general economic or digital asset markets could adversely affect our business and the value of the Class A common stock. Because our\ndecision to raise capital in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature\nof any future issuances of securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of the Class A common stock\nand diluting their interests. Our inability to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms\n59\nTable of Contents\nsatisfactory to us, when we require it, could significantly limit our ability to continue supporting our business growth and responding to business challenges.\nKey business metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely\naffected by real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics.\nWe regularly review key business metrics, including installed kiosks, returning user transaction count, median transaction size and BDCheckout locations, and other measures to\nevaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. These key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure\n(and may be compiled from multiple systems) and have not been validated by an independent third-party. While these numbers are based on what we believe at the time to be\nreasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in such measurements. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our\nkey metrics calculations may be inaccurate, and we may not be able to identify those inaccuracies. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from\ntime to time we make adjustments to improve their accuracy. Additionally, certain of our key business metrics are measured at a point in time and as our products and internal\nprocesses for calculating these metrics evolve over time, a previously reported number could fluctuate. We generally will not update previously disclosed key business metrics\nfor any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are immaterial.\nIf our estimates or judgment relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of\nrevenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates and judgments involve the identification and evaluation of tax positions and\nvaluation of embedded derivatives, among others. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our\nassumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of the Class A common\nstock.\nThe nature of our business requires the application of complex financial accounting rules. If financial accounting standards undergo significant changes, our operating\nresults could be adversely affected.\nThe accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and\ninterpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and may even affect\nthe reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example, on March 31, 2022, the staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting\nBulletin No. 121, or SAB 121, which represents a significant change regarding how a company safeguarding cryptocurrencies held for its platform users reports such\ncryptocurrencies on its balance sheet and requires retrospective application as of January 1, 2022. Moreover, recent actions and public comments from the FASB and the SEC\nhave focused on the integrity of financial reporting and internal controls. In addition, many companies’ accounting policies are being subjected to heightened scrutiny by\nregulators and the public.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing material risks associated with “cybersecurity threats,” as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K, is important to Bitcoin\nDepot. Among the risks we strive to address and mitigate are the disruption of our business operations and the loss of personal and confidential data due to cybersecurity\nincidents, fraud, or extortion.\nWe integrate the identification, assessment, and management of cybersecurity risks into our overall risk management systems and processes. We detect and address such risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats in several ways, including through third-party assessments, internal governance, risk and compliance, participation in industry groups to obtain intel,\nIT audits, and IT security reviews. To protect\n60\nTable of Contents\nagainst, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things, leverage intrusion prevention and detection systems, perform penetration testing, conduct\nemployee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security, and implement appropriate changes to comply with the identified\nemerging laws and regulations. To effectuate these processes, we regularly engage third-party auditors and advisors to assess our cybersecurity programs and ensure compliance\nwith applicable guidelines, standards, and industry best practices.\nSenior management, including our Bitcoin Depot’s Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Cybersecurity Operations Director, Chief Financial Officer\nand General Counsel are responsible for implementing these security measures, as well as being involved in all aspects of cybersecurity incident response and data breach\nmanagement processes. Bitcoin Depot’s incident management plan provides a roadmap for responding to and categorizing incidents. Bitcoin Depot’s IT and cybersecurity\nteams collaborate with other company stakeholders to develop strategies for mitigating and responding to identified cybersecurity events.\nOur cybersecurity threat and risk management processes also involve assessing third-party risks. We maintain a Vendor Management Policy pursuant to which we assign a risk\nrating and assess third-party risks by conducting cybersecurity due diligence on our vendors, suppliers, and other entities with whom we do business. Due diligence includes, as\nappropriate, either requiring proof of security standard compliance or satisfactory responses to our Vendor Assessment Security Questionnaire. We also evaluate the cyber\npractices of, and cybersecurity risks associated with, the engagement of third-party service providers, including when we negotiate cybersecurity and data privacy contract\nterms, such as those relating to information security and audit rights.\nAlthough we constantly evaluate cyber risks, we are unaware of any prior cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us,\nincluding our business strategy, results of operations, or financial conditions.\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board of Directors and management prioritize cybersecurity. Although our full Board of Directors is generally responsible for cybersecurity risk management, it has\nassigned principal oversight responsibility of risks from cybersecurity threats to our Audit Committee. As described above, management is also responsible for assessing and\nmanaging risks from cybersecurity threats, and designated management personnel, including our Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Cybersecurity\nOperations Director, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel and Corporate Secretary meet quarterly as a Risk Committee to determine cybersecurity matters to be shared\nwith the Audit Committee. The Risk Committee provides the Audit Committee updates on such matters on at least a quarterly basis. The Audit Committee reports cybersecurity\nrisks to the full Board during quarterly meetings.\nThe members of senior management involved in managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats, including our Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Security\nOfficer, Cybersecurity Operations Director, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel and Corporate Secretary are experienced in data security matters and financial\nreporting matters. Our Chief Information Security Officer has more than 20 years of experience in information technology and has served in multiple technology executive\nroles, including security-compliance-related roles and holds a degree in Computer Information Systems from Harding University. Our Chief Technology Officer holds a\ncomputer science degree and Master of Engineering in Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has held engineering roles in multiple financial\ntechnology companies. Our Cybersecurity Operations Director holds a Master of Science degree in computer engineering as well as a Master of Science degree in information\nassurance, both from Iowa State University. He has led the security operations centers for large, global data management software company, as well as a large payment\nprocessing company. Additionally, he has led audits and penetration tests as the senior manager of a consulting company. Prior to entering into the private sector, he served as a\npolice officer where he was a detective, specializing in computer crimes and forensics. Our Chief Financial Officer has over 30 years of experience in financial statement\nreporting and auditing. Our General Counsel has significant experience advising on cybersecurity matters and data protection matters and building out cybersecurity and data\nprivacy compliance program across business lines in the financial services industry.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur principal executive offices and headquarters are located in leased premises at 3343 Peachtree Road NE, Suite 750, Atlanta, Georgia, 30326, consisting of approximately\n5,700 square feet. We also lease office space in Canada, located at 267 Richmond Rd, 3rd Fl., Ottawa, Ontario K1Z 6X3, consisting of approximately 1,000 square feet. We\nbelieve that these facilities are suitable to meet our needs.\n61\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nOn January 13, 2023, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (“Canaccord”) commenced proceedings against the Company by filing a claim with the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto,\nOntario which named Bitcoin Depot as the defendant. Canaccord is a financial services firm in Canada that the Company previously had hired to perform advisory services\nrelated to a potential initial public offering in Canada or sales transaction. The claim asserts that Bitcoin Depot breached the contract by terminating the contract to avoid paying\nfees for their services and that Canaccord is entitled to $22.3 million in damages equivalent to the fees alleged to be payable for breach of contract that would have been owed\nupon the closing of a transaction to acquire control, the sale of substantially all the Company’s assets, or a merger transaction pursuant to the previously terminated engagement\nletter for advisory services. Canaccord proposes that the amount of fees would be calculated on the total cash transaction value of the business combination of $880.0 million.\nThe claim also seeks an award for legal and other costs relating to the proceeding. On October 25, 2023, Canaccord amended its claim against the Company to increase the\ndemand amount to $23.0 million which is an additional $0.7 million. Canaccord did not present evidence or statements to support the reason for the increased demand amount.\nIn March 2024, the Canaccord matter moved into the discovery phase.\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business. We believe these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. See Note 24 - Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information for Common Stock\nOur Class A common stock currently trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BTM”.\nOur Warrants currently trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BTMWW”.\nNo other classes of our equity securities are listed or traded on any stock exchange.\nHolders of Record\nAs of, April 9, 2024, there were 43 registered holders of record of our Class A common stock and 9 registered holders of record of our Class B common stock. As of the filing\ndate, there were 24 registered holders of record of our listed Warrants. Since many of our shares of Class A common stock and Warrants are held by brokers and other\ninstitutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.\nDividend Policy\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on the Class A common stock to date (or any other outstanding class of common stock). As a holding company, our ability to pay\ndividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries. We may retain future earnings, if any, in order to pursue our business plan, cover operating\ncosts and otherwise remain competitive. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on,\namong other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. In\naddition, under Delaware law, our board of directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our surplus (which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total\nliabilities, minus statutory capital) or, if there is no surplus, out of our net profits for the then-current and/or immediately preceding fiscal year. In addition, our ability to pay\ndividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.\nHolders of our Class A Preferred stock would participate in any dividend declared on our Class A common stock on an as converted basis.\nStock Performance Graph\n62\nTable of Contents\nN/A\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program providing for repurchases of up to $10 million of the\nCompany’s outstanding Class A common stock through June 30, 2024. Repurchases of shares are made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made from\ntime to time in the open market or by negotiated transactions, including through entry into 10b5-1 trading plans. The amount and timing of repurchases are based on a variety of\nfactors, including stock price, regulatory limitations, debt agreement limitations, and other market and economic factors. The share repurchase plan does not require the\nCompany to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the Company may terminate the repurchase plan at any time. The Company purchased 120,644 shares of our Class\nA common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 on the open market. The following table provides\ninformation regarding purchases of our securities made by us for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.\nSHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS\nFollowing are our monthly share repurchases for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023:\nApproximate Dollar Value of\nTotal Number of Shares Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part\nPeriod Average Price Paid Per Share Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the\nPurchased of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs\nPlans or Programs\n2023\nOctober — $ — — —\nNovember 44,842 $ 2.27 44,842 9,898,209\nDecember 75,802 $ 2.31 75,802 9,723,106\nItem 6.\n[Reserved]\n63\nTable of Contents\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve\nrisks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by\nsuch forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the\nsection titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,”\n“our,” “us,” “the Company,” and “Bitcoin Depot” refer to Bitcoin Depot Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBusiness Overview\nBitcoin Depot owns and operates the largest network of Bitcoin ATMs (“BTMs”) across North America where customers can buy and sell Bitcoin. Bitcoin Depot helps power\nthe digital economy for users of cash.\nOur mission is to bring Crypto to the Masses™. Digital means and systems dominate the way that consumers send money, make purchases, and invest; however, many people\ncontinue to utilize cash as their primary means of initiating a transaction, either as a necessity or as a preference. These individuals have largely been excluded from the digital\nfinancial system and associated technological advancements in our global and digitally interconnected society. Bitcoin Depot’s simple and convenient process to convert cash\ninto Bitcoin via our BTMs and feature-rich mobile app enables not only these users, but also the broader public, to access the digital financial system.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our offerings included approximately 6,300 BTMs in retailer locations throughout the U.S. and Canada, our BDCheckout product, which is accepted\nat approximately 5,700 retail locations, and our mobile app. We maintain a leading position among cash-to-Bitcoin BTM operators in the U.S. and Canada.\nKiosk Network and Retailer Relationships\nBitcoin Depot operates a network of kiosks that allow users to purchase Bitcoin with cash and with respect to 29 kiosks allows them to sell us Bitcoin for cash. Upon using a\nBitcoin Depot kiosk for the first time, users will be prompted to provide certain information for account creation and verification. Users are required to select from three ranges\nof cash amounts to be inserted in the kiosk for purchasing Bitcoin. The user then provides the address of their digital wallet by scanning a QR code or manually inputting their\nunique wallet address; the user can create and use a Bitcoin Depot-branded wallet (un-hosted and non-custodial), or their own other existing digital wallet. Cash is then inserted\nby the user into the kiosk, and the kiosk will confirm the dollar amount and other details of the transaction, including quantity of Bitcoin being purchased. Once the transaction\nis complete, the Bitcoin is electronically delivered to the user’s digital wallet and the user is provided with a physical receipt as well as a receipt via SMS text.\nBitcoin Depot’s largest BTM deployment as of December 31, 2023 is with Circle K, a convenience store chain of over 9,000 stores in North America and over 4,800 stores in\nEurope and other international markets. We are the exclusive provider and operator of BTMs for Circle K in the U.S. and Canada, and as of December 31, 2023, we have\ninstalled our BTMs in approximately 1,300 Circle K stores. We also have kiosks deployed in other convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies, and shopping\nmalls.\nCryptocurrencies\nOur revenues, $689.0 million and $646.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, have not been correlated to the price of Bitcoin historically,\neven in light of volatile Bitcoin prices. For example, our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 grew by 6.5% year-over-year, while the market price of Bitcoin\nincreased by 155% during the same period. Based on our own user surveys, a majority of our users use our products and services for non-speculative purposes, including money\ntransfers, international remittances, and online purchases, among others.\nWe use a sophisticated Bitcoin management process to reduce our exposure to volatility in Bitcoin prices by maintaining a relatively low balance (typically less than $0.8\nmillion) of Bitcoin at any given time, which we believe differentiates us from our competition. Our typical practice is to purchase Bitcoin through a liquidity provider such as\nCumberland DRW or Abra. We replenish our Bitcoin only through purchases from leading Bitcoin liquidity providers and do not engage in any mining of Bitcoin ourselves.\nOur sophisticated replenishment process enables us to satisfy our users’ Bitcoin purchases with our own Bitcoin holdings yet maintain relatively small balances of Bitcoin to\neffectively manage our principal risk. There are two main components of the working capital required in our operations. On the Bitcoin side, we maintain Bitcoin in our hot\nwallets to fulfill orders from users while we are automatically placing orders with liquidity providers and exchanges to replenish the Bitcoin we have sold to users. The second\n64\nTable of Contents\ncomponent to working capital is the cash that accumulates in the BTM kiosks. As users insert cash into the BTM kiosks, cash accumulates until armored carriers collect the cash\nand process it back to our bank accounts. While not required, we typically maintain a variable level of cash in the BTM kiosks at all times. As of December 31, 2023, cash in\nthe BTM kiosks was approximately 21.2% of average monthly revenues.\nBitAccess and BDCheckout\nIn July 2021, we acquired BitAccess, and in the second quarter of 2022, we launched BDCheckout. BitAccess added new software features to our BTMs and positions us to\nservice new channels of users while eventually having full control over our own software capabilities. All of our BTMs use the BitAccess software. The acquisition also\ndiversified our revenue streams into software offerings and generated significant savings in transaction processing fees and reduced other operating expenses. BitAccess\nrevenues from third-party customers from the date of acquisition have not been material and the launch of BDCheckout has not yet had a meaningful impact on our results of\noperations.\nThe Merger\nOn June 30, 2023, we consummated the Merger. GSRM’s stockholders approved the Merger at a special meeting of the stockholders held on June 28, 2023 (the “Special\nMeeting”).\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the following occurred:\n•GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. (“GSRM”) filed a Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,\npursuant to which GSRM changed its name to “Bitcoin Depot Inc.” and the number of authorized shares of our common stock was increased to 2,272,250,000 shares,\nconsisting of (i) 800,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, (ii) 20,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, (iii) 300,000,000 shares of Class M common stock,\n(iv) 800,000,000 shares of Class O common stock, (v) 300,000,000 shares of Class V common stock, (vi) 2,250,000 shares of Class E common stock, consisting of\nthree series: (a) 750,000 shares of Class E-1 common stock, (b) 750,000 shares of Class E-2 common stock and (c) 750,000 shares of Class E-3 common stock, and\n(vii) 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock;\n•A restructuring was consummated, consisting of (a) the merger of BT OpCo with and into a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company known as “Bitcoin\nDepot Operating LLC”, with Bitcoin Depot Operating LLC surviving the merger and (b) the formation of BT HoldCo LLC (“BT HoldCo”) and contribution of all of\nBT Assets’ equity in BT OpCo to BT HoldCo, pursuant to which BT HoldCo issued BT HoldCo Common Units, BT HoldCo Preferred Units and BT HoldCo Earnout\nUnits to BT Assets; (ii) we paid cash to BT Assets in exchange for certain BT HoldCo Common Units; (iii) we contributed (a) cash to BT HoldCo in exchange for BT\nHoldCo Common Units, (b) warrants issued by BT HoldCo to purchase a number of BT HoldCo Common Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common\nstock that may be purchased upon the exercise in full of all warrants of GSRM outstanding immediately after the closing of the Merger and (c) a number of BT\nHoldCo Earnout Units equal to the number of newly issued shares of Class E common stock issued to Sponsor; (iv) Sponsor exchanged all shares of Class B common\nstock for newly issued shares of Class A common stock and Class E common stock, subject to the terms of conversion or forfeiture and cancellation set forth in that\ncertain Sponsor Support Agreement, dated as of August 24, 2022, by and among Sponsor, GSRM and BT Assets, as amended by the First Amendment to the Sponsor\nSupport Agreement, dated as of June 7, 2023; (v) BT Assets was issued 44,100,000 newly issued shares of high vote Class V common stock, convertible at BT\nAssets’ election into Class A common stock; and (vi) we issued 500,000 shares of Class A common stock under the Incentive Plan to the Chief Executive Officer of\nthe Company; and\n•upon the execution and delivery to BT OpCo and GSRM of Phantom Equity Award Termination Agreements by the holders of Phantom Equity Awards (as defined\nin the Phantom Plan) outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger were converted into the right to receive, in aggregate cash payments in an amount\nequal to $350,000 and 35,000 restricted stock units, which vest quarterly over one year from the date of grant.\nRegulatory Environment\nWe operate internationally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry,\nincluding countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those\nenacted prior to the advent of digital payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and\nregulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions\n65\nTable of Contents\nrelated to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See “Governmental Regulations” and “Legal\nProceedings” in Part I, Item I.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe monitor and evaluate the following key business metrics to measure performance, identify trends, develop and refine growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We\nbelieve these metrics and measures are useful to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our business, and to facilitate comparisons of our performance to that of our\ncompetitors.\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems. While the\nmeasurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key\nmetrics. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment and we regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time,\nwe may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember September June 30 March 31 December September June 30 March 31 December September June 30 March 31 December September June 30 March 31\n31 30 31 30 31 30 31 30\n2023 2022 2021 2020\nInstalled kiosks (at period end) 6,334 6,404 6,351 6,441 6,530 6,787 6,955 6,711 6,220 4,520 2,811 1,859 1,061 671 159 127\nReturning user transaction count 8.3 9.1 9.2 10.0 10.5 11.2 11.5 11.9 12.3 11.5 11.8 12.2 12.0 12.3 14.0 13.8\nMedian kiosk transaction size (in $) 200 200 200 200 200 180 170 176 168 160 160 140 140 100 70 90\nBDCheckout locations (at period end)\n(1) (3) 5,681 5,681 5,195 2,754 8,661 8,661 8,395 — — — — — — — — —\nKiosks held with logistics providers (2) 898 842 981 891 795 — — — — — — — — — — —\n(1)BDCheckout was launched in the second quarter of 2022.\n(2)Kiosks held with our logistic providers or in-transit to new locations, which we believe will result in higher transaction volume and revenue once deployed.\n(3)During the three months ended March 31, 2023, one of our retail partners discontinued all BDCheckout and cryptocurrency transactions in its stores.\nInstalled Kiosks\nWe believe this metric provides us an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our potential future business opportunities. We define installed kiosks\nas the number of kiosks we have installed at the end of the quarter in a retail location and that are connected to our network. We monitor transaction volume at our kiosks on a\ncontinuous basis to maximize transaction volumes from the locations where our kiosks are placed. Based on these monitoring activities, we may re-deploy certain of our kiosks,\nusing third-party logistics providers, to new locations (e.g., those available with our new retail partners) that we believe will maximize transaction volumes and revenues.\nReturning User Transaction Count\nWe believe this metric provides us an indicator of user retention and our competitive advantage relative to our peers, as well as the trajectory of adoption of cryptocurrency, and\nallows us to make strategic decisions. We define returning user transaction count as the average number of aggregate transactions completed at any kiosk in the four quarters\ntrailing the quarter in which a given user’s first transaction occurred, measured only for users who complete more than one transaction. For example, as of December 31, 2023,\nusers who first transacted at one of our kiosks during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and who subsequently completed a second transaction completed an average\nof 8.3 transactions over the twelve months following their initial transaction.\nMedian Kiosk Transaction Size\nWe believe this metric provides us information to analyze user behavior as well as evaluate our performance and formulate financial projections. We calculate median kiosk\ntransaction size based on the dollar value of all purchases and sales of Bitcoin at our kiosks, including transaction fees, during the rolling twelve month period.\n66\nTable of Contents\nBDCheckout Locations\nWe believe this metric provides us an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business and our potential future business opportunities. We calculate BDCheckout\nlocations as the number of locations where BDCheckout is available at the end of the quarter. We are currently in discussion with other retail partners to expand our\nBDCheckout offering into additional locations.\nSegment Reporting\nOur financial reporting is organized into one segment. We make specific disclosures concerning our products and services because they facilitate our discussion of trends and\noperational initiatives within our business and industry. Our products and services are aggregated and viewed by management as one reportable segment due to a similarity in\nthe nature of customers and overall economic characteristics, the nature of the products and services provided and the applicable regulatory environment.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the cash paid by customers to purchase Bitcoin from our kiosks. For example, approximately 99.9% of our revenue in the year\nended December 31, 2023 was derived from the sale of our cryptocurrency, including the markup at which we sell cryptocurrency to users (which can vary between\nBDCheckout and BTM kiosks) and a separate flat transaction fee. These user-initiated transactions are governed by terms and conditions agreed to at the time of each point-of-\nsale transaction and do not extend beyond the transaction.\nFor the periods presented, the markup percentage for BTM kiosk transactions ranged between 15% and 31%, of the USD amount of the transaction with such markup rates\nhistorically having been, and continuing to be, subject to fluctuation as a result of our ongoing price strategy testing. The markup percentage for BDCheckout transactions has\nbeen 15% since inception/rollout of such transaction type in 2023. Finally, the Company receives a commission as a percentage for our website transactions which was 12.0%\nthrough December 31, 2023. Markup percentages are determined by examining user transaction patterns in various geographic locations, based on ongoing markup rate testing,\nwith the ultimate aim of optimizing profitability, growth and user base.\nFor each Bitcoin transaction on our kiosks or utilizing BDCheckout, the cryptocurrency price displayed to users includes the exchange rate at which we sell Bitcoin to users as\nwell as a separate flat transaction fee. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we charge (i) a flat $3.00 fee on all transactions at BTM kiosks, which generally\ncorresponds to the costs underlying such transactions and (ii) a flat $3.50 fee on BDCheckout transactions, which is what our payment provider charges us to facilitate\ntransactions using their network.\nWe support the purchase of Bitcoin from users at only 29 kiosks, or less than 1.0% of our total kiosks as of December 31, 2023, and currently do not have plans to expand the\nability of our users to sell Bitcoin to us in exchange for cash. We charge the same fees on Bitcoin we purchase from users via our kiosks as we do for Bitcoin we sell to users at\nour kiosks.\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nOur cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization), which is primarily driven by transaction volume, consists primarily of direct costs related to selling Bitcoin and\noperating our network of kiosks. Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) includes the cost of Bitcoin, fees paid to obtain Bitcoin, impairment of\ncryptocurrencies, gains on sales of Bitcoin on an exchange, fees paid to operate the software on the BTMs, rent paid for floorspace for BTMs, fees paid to transfer Bitcoin to\nusers, cost of BTM repair and maintenance, and the cost of armored trucks to collect and transport cash deposited into the BTMs.\nOur costs associated with a BDCheckout transaction are lower than costs associated with a BTM transaction, primarily due to significantly greater operating expenses associated\nwith the BTMs, including cash collection fees and short-term lease payments to the retail locations where the kiosks are placed. However, the profitability of the two services is\nsimilar because of the higher markup that Bitcoin Depot applies to BTM transactions to support the higher costs associated therewith.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses consists of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization.\n67\nTable of Contents\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our customer support, marketing, finance, legal,\ncompliance, operations, human resources, and administrative personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs related to fees paid for professional\nservices, including legal, tax, and accounting services.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization include depreciation on computer hardware and software, BTMs (including both BTMs owned by us and those\nsubject to finance leases), office furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets.\nOther (expense) income\nOther (expense) income includes interest expense, expenses associated with the PIPE transaction, the impact of lease modifications, and gains and losses on foreign currency\ntransactions.\nInterest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest expense on our borrowings and our finance leases.\n68\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison between Year Ended December 31, 2023 and Year Ended December 31, 2022\nThe following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nStatements of Income and Comprehensive\nIncome (Loss) information:\nRevenue $ 688,967 $ 646,830 $ 42,137 6.5%\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization\nreported separately below) 587,938 574,535 13,403 2.3%\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative 57,770 36,991 20,779 56.2%\nDepreciation and amortization 12,788 18,783 (5,995) (31.9)%\nTotal operating expenses $ 70,558 $ 55,774 $ 14,784 26.5%\nIncome from operations $ 30,471 $ 16,521 $ 13,950 84.4%\nOther (expense) income\nInterest expense (11,926) (12,318) 392 (3.2)%\nOther (expense) income (16,737) 118 (16,855) (14,283.9)%\nLoss on foreign currency transactions (289) (380) 91 (23.9)%\nTotal other expense $ (28,952) $ (12,580) $ (16,372) 130.1%\nIncome before provision for income taxes and\nnon-controlling interest 1,519 3,941 (2,422) (61.5)%\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (49) (395) 346 (87.6)%\nNet income $ 1,470 $ 3,546 $ (2,076) (58.5)%\nNet income attributable to Legacy Bitcoin Depot\nunit holders 12,906 3,980 8,926 224.3%\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest 14,666 (434) 15,100 (3,479.3)%\nNet loss attributable to Bitcoin Depot Inc. $ (26,102) $ - $ (26,102) (100.0)%\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\nNet income\n1,470 3,546 (2,076) (58.5)%\nForeign currency translation adjustments (4) (110) 106 (96.4)%\nTotal comprehensive income $ 1,466 $ 3,436 $ (1,970) (57.3)%\nComprehensive income attributable to Legacy\nBitcoin Depot unit holders $ 12,885 $ 3,870 $ 9,015 232.9%\nComprehensive income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest $ 14,683 $ (434) $ 15,117 (3,483.2)%\nComprehensive loss attributable to Bitcoin\nDepot Inc. $ (26,102) $ - $ (26,102) (100.0)%\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by approximately $42.1 million, or 6.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to\nincreases in kiosk transaction revenue which was resulting from an increase in the average transaction size and an increased number of users and transaction volume in relocated\nkiosks offset by a lower average number of installed kiosks in 2023.\n69\nTable of Contents\nRevenue disaggregated by revenue stream is as follows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nKiosk Transaction Revenue $ 686,314 $ 639,965 $ 46,349 7.2%\nBDCheckout 1,149 692 457 66.0%\nOTC — 2,080 (2,080) (100.0)%\nCompany Website 408.1\n879 173 706 %\nSoftware Services Revenue 575 3,185 (2,610) (81.9)%\nHardware Revenue 50 735 (685) (93.2)%\nTotal Revenue $ 688,967 $ 646,830 $ 42,137 6.5%\nKiosk Transaction Revenue\nRevenue generated by our BTM kiosks increased by approximately $46.3 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2022, primarily related to an increase in the average transaction size and an increased number of users and transaction volume in relocated kiosks. Additionally during 2023, the\nCompany had on average 5% lower amount of kiosks installed than compared to 2022, due to kiosk optimization efforts.\nBDCheckout\nOur BDCheckout revenue increased by approximately $0.5 million or 66.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022,\nprimarily due to the fact that we launched our BDCheckout product in June 2022.\nOTC\nWe discontinued our OTC services in June 2022. Our OTC revenue was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSoftware Services\nOur software services revenue decreased by approximately $2.6 million, or 81.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022,\nprimarily due to a decrease in revenues from a significant customer due to a contract termination in August 2022.\nHardware Revenue\nOur hardware revenue decreased by approximately $0.7 million, or 93.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily\ndue to sales of hardware to new customers in 2022 that did not re-occur in 2023.\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by approximately $13.4 million, or 2.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the expansion of our network of kiosks and increase in transaction volume.\nThe following table sets forth the components of cost of revenue for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nCryptocurrency Expenses $ 534,234 $ 519,347 $ 14,887 2.9%\nFloorspace Leases 34,616 39,765 (5,149) (12.9)%\nKiosk Operations 19,088 15,423 3,665 23.8%\nTotal Cost of Revenue (excluding Depreciation and Amortization) $ 587,938 $ 574,535 $ 13,403 2.3%\n70\nTable of Contents\nCryptocurrency Expenses\nThe following table sets forth the components of cryptocurrency expenses in our cost of revenue for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nCost of Cryptocurrency - BTM Kiosks $ 532,356 $ 513,951 $ 18,405 3.6%\nCost of Cryptocurrency - OTC (1) — 1,958 (1,958) (100.0)%\nCost of Cryptocurrency - BDCheckout 985 595 390 65.5%\nSoftware Processing Fees 280 2,519 (2,239) (88.9)%\nExchange Fees 22 119 (97) (81.5)%\nMining Fees 575 195 380 194.9%\nSoftware Processing Fee - BDCheckout 16 10 6 60.0%\nTotal Cryptocurrency Expenses $ 534,234 $ 519,347 $ 14,887 2.9%\n(1) We discontinued the OTC product in June 2022.\nCost of Cryptocurrency - BTM Kiosks\nOur cost of cryptocurrency related to BTM kiosks increased by approximately $18.4 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily as a result of higher overall sales.\nCost of Cryptocurrency - OTC\nOur cost of cryptocurrency related to OTC decreased by approximately $2.0 million, or 100.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, as a result of our decision to discontinue our OTC service in June 2022.\nCost of Cryptocurrency - BDCheckout\nOur cost of goods sold related to BDCheckout increased by approximately $0.4 million, or 65.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was a result of BDCheckout being first introduced in June 2022.\nSoftware Processing fees\nOur software processing fees decreased by approximately $2.2 million, or 88.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease was a result of the decrease in costs from using third-party software as a result of our acquisition of a majority interest in BitAccess in July 2021 and incorporating\nthe BitAccess operating system into our kiosks. We have converted all of our kiosks to the BitAccess technology which has reduced the costs we paid to a third-party software\nprovider for software services.\nFloorspace Leases\nOur floorspace lease expenses decreased by approximately $5.1 million, or 12.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur lease expenses related to rents paid to store owners for floorspace decreased for the period as a result of the decreased numbers of kiosks in operation during 2023 compared\nto the same period in the prior year.\nKiosk Operations\nOur kiosk operations increased by approximately $3.7 million, or 23.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Our kiosk\noperations consisted of armored cash collection, bank fees, software costs, insurance and repair and maintenance. As a result of relocating kiosks, our costs associated with\nmaintaining and operating the kiosks increased accordingly.\n71\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $20.8 million, or 56.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. These costs increased primarily due to expenses related to the closing of the Merger which for the year ended December 31, 2023 which has generated an\nincremental cost of approximately $9.3 million attributed to legal, accounting and advisory services.\nOperating expenses were also driven higher by generally higher payroll costs resulting from the significant increase in headcount to support our operations during 2023, along\nwith stock compensation expense associated with our RSU grants after closing of the Transaction. Additionally, the Company incurred increased professional services expenses\ncorresponding to the expansion of our operations.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by approximately $6.0 million, or 31.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022,\nprimarily due to the refinancing of leases in the second half of 2022 and during 2023.\nOther (expense) income\nOther expenses increased by approximately $16.4 million or 130.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company\nincurred a loss on lease modifications of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 that did not occur in 2022. Interest expense decreased by approximately $0.4\nmillion, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in interest expense arising from the\nsignificant number of kiosks financed through modifications of finance leases in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, we incurred $0.3 million of interest related to the modification of our note payable in May 2023 as described in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements. As a result of our Note Payable refinance in June 2023, we incurred $1.0 million lower interest costs in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 due to a $16.4 million paydown of the balance.\nOther expenses increased by approximately $14.9 million related to the expenses incurred associated with the PIPE Financing agreement. This agreement was entered into upon\ncompletion of the Merger on June 30, 2023 and settled on October 11, 2023 for de minimus consideration. Based on the settlement terms of this agreement, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we recorded the difference between the fair value of the Series A Preferred Shares and the de minimus cash consideration received of $13.9 million as\nOther Expenses. In addition, we incurred cash fees due to the Subscribers of $0.9 million.\nNet income (loss) attributable to Legacy Bitcoin Depot unit holders\nPrior to the close of the Merger, net income was allocated to the Legacy Bitcoin Depot unit holders. After the close of the Merger on June 30, 2023, the Legacy Bitcoin Depot\nunit holders no longer receive any income allocation as they are owners of BT HoldCo.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\nPrior to the Merger, the non-controlling interest reflected the unaffiliated interest in BitAccess. Subsequent to the close of the Merger, the non-controlling interest reflects both\nthe unaffiliated interests in BitAccess and the interests held by BT Assets in BT HoldCo. BT Assets is entitled to a preferred return of $29.0 million before any distributions\nmay be made to the other unit holders (other than certain permitted tax distributions). To the extent net income exceeds the $29.0 million preferred return, the excess income\nwill be allocated to Bitcoin Depot and BT Assets based on their pro-rata economic interests in BT HoldCo.\nNet income (loss) attributable to Bitcoin Depot Inc.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, no net income was allocated to Bitcoin Depot Inc. from BT HoldCo. The public entity incurred direct legal and professional\nservices in maintaining its operations as well as costs associated with the PIPE Financing resulting in a $26.1 million net loss attributable to Bitcoin Depot Inc.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nWe define Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP financial measure) as revenue less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) and depreciation and amortization\nadjusted to add back depreciation and amortization. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our\nresults of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included Adjusted Gross Profit in\n72\nTable of Contents\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measurement used internally by management to measure the efficiency of our business. This non-GAAP financial measure\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying\nprimarily on U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted Gross Profit on a supplemental basis. Our computation of Adjusted Gross Profit may not be comparable to other similarly\ntitled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate this measure in the same fashion. You should review the reconciliation of Gross Profit to\nAdjusted Gross Profit below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of revenue to Adjusted Gross Profit for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nRevenue $ 688,967 $ 646,830\nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and\namortization) (587,938) (574,535)\nDepreciation and amortization excluded from cost of revenue (12,455) (18,783)\nGross Profit $ 88,574 $ 53,512\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization excluded from cost of revenue $ 12,455 $ 18,783\nAdjusted Gross Profit $ 101,029 $ 72,295\nGross Profit Margin (1) 12.9% 8.3%\nAdjusted Gross Profit Margin (1) 14.7% 11.2%\n(1)Calculated as a percentage of revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) as net income before interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring expenses,\nshare-based compensation, expenses related to PIPE financing and miscellaneous cost adjustments.\nThe items below are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven\nby core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to\ninvestors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business\nperformance. Moreover, we have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measurement used internally by management to make\noperating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance and perform strategic and financial planning. However, you should be aware that when\nevaluating Adjusted EBITDA, we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. The presentation of this measure should not be\nconstrued as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Further, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in\nisolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on U.S. GAAP\nresults and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by\nother companies because not all companies calculate this measure in the same fashion. You should review the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA below and not\nrely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nNet income $ 1,470 $ 3,546\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense 11,926 12,318\nIncome tax (benefit) expense 49 395\nDepreciation and amortization 12,788 18,783\nExpense related to the PIPE transaction (1) 14,896 —\nNon-recurring expenses (2) 9,298 4,879\nShare-based compensation 2,524 1,230\nSpecial bonus (3) 3,040 —\nExpenses associated with the termination of the phantom equity participation plan 350 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 56,341 $ 41,151\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (4) 8.2% 6.4%\n(1)Amounts include the recognition of a non-cash expense of $13.9 million related to the PIPE transaction for the year ended December 31, 2023, entered into as of close of\nthe Merger on June 30, 2023.\n(2)Comprised of non-recurring professional service fees incurred by the Company related to the close of the Transaction.\n(3)Amount includes (A) Transaction bonus and related taxes to employees of approximately $1.4 million and (B) Founder Transaction bonus as a result of close of the\nMerger, of approximately $1.6 million, recognized as share-based compensation, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n(4)Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. The Company uses this measure to evaluate its overall profitability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn December 31, 2023, we had negative working capital of approximately $(8.8) million, which included cash and cash equivalents and other current assets of approximately\n$37.3 million, offset by accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately $46.0 million. We reported net income of approximately $1.5 million during the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nOn December 31, 2022, we had working capital of approximately $(6.5) million, which included cash and cash equivalents and other current assets of approximately $40.3\nmillion, offset by accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately $46.8 million. We reported net income of approximately $3.5 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nFor each of the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, approximately 99.9% of our total transaction volume was attributable to transactions in Bitcoin and, as of\nthe date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, transactions in Bitcoin account for 100% of our transaction volumes. We purchase Bitcoin through a liquidity provider on a just-\nin-time basis based on expected transaction volumes in order to maintain a balance at a specified amount. Our ability to dynamically rebalance the levels of Bitcoin we hold at\nany given time based on transaction volumes and the market price of Bitcoin means that there are limited working capital requirements related to our Bitcoin management\nactivities. There are two main components of the working capital required in our operations. We maintain Bitcoin (currently in an amount which, at any given time, is typically\nless than $0.8 million) in our hot wallets to fulfill orders from users while we are automatically placing orders with liquidity providers and exchanges to replenish the Bitcoin we\nhave sold to users. The second component to working capital is cash and cash equivalents generated from sales at our BTM kiosks. As users insert cash into the BTM kiosks,\ncash accumulates until armored carriers collect the cash and process it back to our bank accounts. While not required, we typically maintain a variable level of cash in the BTM\nkiosks at all times. As of December 31, 2023, cash in the BTM kiosks was approximately 21.2% of average monthly revenues.\nIn connection with the closing of the Merger, we had several events impacting our liquidity. We refinanced our note payable and paid down approximately $16.4 million of\nprincipal, as well as incurred a $2.3 million exit fee. As of December 31, 2023, we had $21.1 million outstanding under our notes payable. See Note 25 - Subsequent Events in\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nThe Company’s primary future cash requirements will be to fund operations, debt service, capital expenditures, employee defined contribution plans, and lease payment\nobligations. In addition, the Company may use cash in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments. Specifically, the Company expects its primary cash requirements\nfor fiscal year 2024 to be as follows:\n74\nTable of Contents\nDebt service\nWe expect to make principal and interest payments of approximately $7.5 million during fiscal year 2024 under our currently outstanding debt facilities based on interest rates at\nyear end. Capital expenditures. The Company is planning to either purchase or lease finance additional kiosks. The total amount of kiosk purchases and kiosk lease financing is\napproximately $5.0 million for the year ended 2024.\nLease payments\nWe expect to make lease payments of approximately $8.3 million for our operating and finance leases during fiscal year 2024 under our effective leases as of December 31,\n2023. In addition to the matters identified above, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may be involved in litigation, claims, government inquiries, investigations and\nproceedings relating to commercial, employment, environmental and regulatory matters. An unfavorable resolution in this or other matters could have a material adverse effect\non the Company's future cash requirements.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts\nand the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to purchase additional kiosks and invest in the expansion of our products and services. We may in the future enter\ninto arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional\nequity or debt financing or sell assets to raise and/or maintain our liquidity. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on acceptable\nterms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months from the\ndate of this annual report on From 10-K.\nShare repurchase program\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company announced that its Board authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $10\nmillion of outstanding shares of its Class A common stock beginning immediately and continuing through and including June 30, 2024. From the date of authorization through\nDecember 31, 2023, 120,644 shares of the Company's Class A common stock had been repurchased with a total cost of $0.3 million. The Company anticipates using cash flows\nfrom operations to make any future share repurchases.\nSources of Liquidity\nTerm Loan\nOn December 21, 2020, we entered into a credit agreement among Legacy Bitcoin Depot, as borrower, BT Assets, as guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the\nfinancial institutions and institutional investors from time to time party thereto, as lenders, and Silverview Credit Partners, LP, (f/k/a Silverpeak Credit Partners, LP), as\nadministrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”) which provided for (i) initial term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million, comprised of two $12.5 million\ntranches and (ii) a $15.0 million delayed draw term loan facility. In 2021, we utilized the delayed draw term loan facility in the full amount of $15.0 million, and on March 31,\n2022, we amended the Credit Agreement to add a new $5.0 million tranche 3 term loan (the initial term loans, the delayed draw term loan, and the tranche 3 term loan,\ncollectively, the “Term Loans”). Upon consummation of certain assumption conditions under the amended and restated note, Legacy Bitcoin Depot and BT Assets, Inc. were\nsubstituted for BT OpCo and BT HoldCo, LLC respectively. The term loans are guaranteed by BT HoldCo and all of our subsidiaries and were collateralized by substantially all\nof our assets. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the aggregate amounts owed under the Credit Agreement totaled approximately $19.9 million and $39.4\nmillion, respectively. The proceeds of the borrowings under the term loans were used to fund the acquisition of BitAccess and expand headcount to support additional kiosks\nbrought online.\nThe tranche 1 term loan had a maturity date of December 15, 2023, and the tranche 2 term loan, tranche 3 term loan and delayed draw term loan had maturity dates of\nDecember 15, 2024. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including compliance with a minimum\ncash balance of $2.5 million, and a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00.\nIn May 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement whereby the interest rate increased from 15% to 20% per annum from February 16, 2023\nthrough August 15, 2023, contingent upon the closing of the Merger to allow for a renegotiation of\n75\nTable of Contents\nthe repayment schedule. Additionally, the amendment provided for a catch-up payment of $0.3 million for additional interest from February 16, 2023 through May 1, 2023, was\nmade by May 15, 2023.\nOn June 23, 2023, the Company amended and restated the credit agreement with our lender (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\"). As of that date $16.4 million was\noutstanding under the original Credit Agreement as amended to that date. Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we borrowed $20.8 million which is subject to\nan annual interest at a rate of 17% per annum, and repaid approximately $16.4 million of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans. We also paid an exit fee of $2.3\nmillion. We are required to make monthly interest payments and fixed principal payments every six months beginning on December 15, 2023 through June 15, 2026. The\nAmended and Restated Credit Agreement matures on June 23, 2026, at which time, any outstanding principal balance and any accrued interest become due. The Amended and\nRestated Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and is guaranteed by Mintz Assets, Inc., Express Vending, Inc., Intuitive Software, LLC, Digital\nGold Ventures, Inc. and BitAccess Inc. BT HoldCo and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to certain financial covenants contained in the Amended and Restated Credit\nAgreement, which require us to maintain certain cash balances, and a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio, in addition to customary administrative covenants. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and administrative covenants. See Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. See Note 25 - Subsequent Events in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther debt\nIn December 2023, the Company entered into a 36-month collateralized term loan with a financing company in the amount of $1.3 million to facilitate the purchase of\npreviously leased kiosks. In accordance with the term loan, the kiosks are collateral for the loan. The loan is subject to annual interest of 15.75% with interest and principal\npayments due monthly. Additionally, the Company transferred certain right-of-use assets recorded as finance leases held with the financing company to kiosks – owned and\nfinance lease liabilities to notes payable during the year-ended December 31, 2023. The remaining unpaid obligation under these arrangements is $1.4 million as of December\n31, 2023. Under these arrangements, the loans mature between June and August 2024 and is subject to annual interest of 17.81% with interest and principal payments due\nmonthly. The total amount of principal due on this loan was $2.6 million as of December 31, 2023.\nPIPE Financing\nOn June 23, 2023, GSRM entered into a private placement agreement with certain subscribers (“Subscribers”). For purposes of settlement under the PIPE Agreement, the\nnotional amount of 5,000,000 shares consisted of (a) the 4,300,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock sold at the closing of the Merger, and (b) 700,000 shares of Class A\ncommon stock that were held by the Subscribers prior to the consummation of the Transaction. In connection with the Transaction, the Subscribers entered into non-redemption\nagreements with the Company and received additional shares of Class A common stock in exchange for their commitments not to redeem. See the discussion below under\nGSRM Share Issuance for further information.\nOn October 11, 2023, the PIPE Agreement was settled with the Subscribers for de minimus consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred\nexpenses of $15.2 million associated with the PIPE agreement which has been recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nKiosk Financing Transactions\nWe have finance leases with our kiosk suppliers that expire on various dates through March 2026. Such leases are financed by third parties, none of which are our suppliers. Our\nfinance lease agreements are for two or three-year terms and include various options to either renew the lease or exercise an option to purchase (which, in all cases, is a bargain\npurchase option) the equipment at the end of the term. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average life remaining on the finance leases was approximately 1.61 years. The\noutstanding total lease liability balance of approximately $9.6 million as of December 31, 2023, is recorded within Current portion of obligations under finance lease and\nObligations under finance lease, net of current portion.\n76\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents the sources of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash provided by operating activities $ 41,100 $ 31,255\nCash (used) in investing activities $ (22) $ (3,110)\nCash (used) in financing activities $ (48,858) $ (28,542)\nNet (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (1) $ (7,781) $ (488)\n(1)Includes effect of exchange rate changes on cash.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, due to a $12.8\nmillion increase in non-cash items principally related to an $14.5 million increase from Series A Preferred Share PIPE Issuance and a $2.9 million increase in stock\ncompensation, slightly offset by a $6.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization, and a $2.5 million decrease in purchases of services in cryptocurrency.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, due to a $2.0 million\ncontingent consideration payment in 2022, and a $1.1 million decrease in acquisition of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, due to a $15.6 million\nincrease in principal payments on notes payable, a $3.7 million decrease in issuance of notes payable and a $3.7 million increase in cash distributions. These cash outflows were\noffset by the Company recognizing net proceeds from Merger of $3.3 million which did not occur in 2022 and $3.1 million less principal payments on finance lease due to lease\nmodifications and buyouts in 2023.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of our operating and finance lease obligations was approximately $10.2 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had no open\npurchase orders for kiosks.\nSee Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our notes payable.\nSee Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our tax receivable\nagreement.\nSee Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our leases.\nSee Note 24 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our material\ncommitments and contingencies.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts\nreported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of\nestimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.\nEstimates are used for, but not limited to, cryptocurrencies and the associated impairment, recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill,\n77\nTable of Contents\nrevenue recognition, valuation of current and deferred income taxes, the determination of the useful lives of property and equipment, for share-based compensation specifically\nthe performance-based awards and the probability of achieving the performance criteria, fair value of long-term debt, present value of lease liabilities and right of use assets,\nassumptions and inputs for fair value measurements used in business combinations and contingencies, including liabilities that we deem are not probable of assertion. We base\nour estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ from these\nestimates.\nCritical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and\nconditions. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with the discussion of significant accounting policies included in the notes of the consolidated financial\nstatements. Except with respect to the following additional critical accounting policies in connection with the business combination, refer to discussion of the Company’s critical\naccounting policies, in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K,\nwhich was filed with the SEC on July 7, 2023.\nOur financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies we have adopted. To get a full understanding of our financial statements, one\nmust have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed. A summary of our critical accounting policies follows:\nCryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrencies are a unit of account that functions as a medium of exchange on a respective blockchain network, and a digital and decentralized ledger that keeps a record of\nall transactions that take place across a peer-to-peer network. Our cryptocurrencies were primarily comprised of Bitcoin, LTC, and ETH for the periods presented and are\ncollectively referred to as “cryptocurrencies” in the consolidated financial statements. We primarily purchase cryptocurrencies to sell to customers.\nWe account for cryptocurrencies as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, and they are recorded on our consolidated\nBalance Sheets at cost, less any impairments. We have control and ownership over our cryptocurrencies which are stored in both our proprietary hot wallet and hot wallets\nhosted by a third-party, BitGo, Inc.\nThe primary purpose of our operations is to buy and sell Bitcoin using the BTM kiosk network and other services. We do not engage in broker-dealer activities. We use various\nexchanges and liquidity providers to purchase, liquidate and manage our Bitcoin positions; however, this does not impact the accounting for these assets as intangible assets.\nImpairment\nBecause our cryptocurrencies are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, the cryptocurrencies are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired in accordance with ASC 350. We have determined that a decline in the quoted market price\nbelow the carrying value at any time during the assessed period is viewed as an impairment indicator because the cryptocurrencies are traded in active markets where there are\nobservable prices. Therefore, the fair value is used to assess whether an impairment loss should be recorded. If the fair value of the cryptocurrency decreases below the initial\ncost basis, or the carrying value, at any time during the assessed period, an impairment charge is recognized at that time in cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and\namortization). After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of the cryptocurrency becomes our new accounting basis and this new cost basis will not be\nadjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value. For the purposes of measuring impairment on our cryptocurrencies, we determine the fair value of our cryptocurrency\non a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on quoted (unadjusted) prices on an active exchange in the United States that the\nCompany has determined is its principal market (Level 1 inputs).\nWe purchase cryptocurrencies, which are held in our hot wallets, on a just-in-time basis to facilitate sales to customers and mitigate exposure to volatility in cryptocurrency\nprices. We sell our cryptocurrencies to our customers from our BTM kiosks, OTC and BDCheckout locations in exchange for cash, for a prescribed transaction fee applied to\nthe current market price of the cryptocurrency at the time of the transaction, plus a predetermined markup. When the cryptocurrency is sold to customers, we relieve the adjusted\ncost basis of our cryptocurrency, net of impairments, on a first-in, first-out basis within cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization). In the fourth quarter of 2022,\nwe discontinued the sale of ETH and LTC to our customers.\nThe related cash flows from purchases and sales of cryptocurrencies are presented as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n78\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill and intangible assets, net\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and any non-controlling interest in the\nacquired entity in a business combination. We test for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than\nnot reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting\nunits, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value\nof each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future\ncash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur,\nand determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The Company performs their annual test for impairment as of December 31 at the reporting unit level.\nAs a result of the acquisition of BitAccess in July 2021, we determined we had two reporting units. In August 2022, we terminated a significant BitAccess customer contract\nand determined that the termination of a significant customer was a triggering event requiring an assessment of impairment of both the acquired intangible assets and goodwill\nas of the date of the termination. In addition, as a result of the migration of our BTM kiosks onto the BitAccess platform and the integration of BitAccess operations and\nprocesses into our core operations, we re-assessed our reporting unit determination and concluded there was one reporting unit subsequent to the triggering event. As a result of\nthe triggering event and reporting unit re-organization, we performed an impairment test of our acquired intangible assets and goodwill both before and after the re-organization\nbased on the methodology described above. Based on these events, no impairment was determined as of the triggering event date.\nFor purposes of performing our annual impairment test, we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill using the consolidated cash flows of the single reporting unit to\ndetermine if our goodwill and intangible asset were impaired as of December 31, 2023 in accordance with the methodology described above. There were no triggering events\nidentified during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIntangible assets, net consist of tradenames, customer relationships, and software applications. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated lives and\nevaluated for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that warrants such a review. Management periodically evaluates whether changes to estimated useful\nlives of intangible assets are necessary to ensure our estimates accurately reflect the economic use of the related intangible assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nBTM Kiosks, BDCheckout and OTC\nRevenue is principally derived from the sale of cryptocurrencies at the point-of-sale on transactions initiated by customers. These customer-initiated transactions are governed\nby terms and conditions agreed to at the time of each point-of-sale transaction and do not extend beyond the transaction. We charge a fee at the transaction level. The transaction\nprice for the customer is the price of the cryptocurrency, which is based on the exchange value at the time of the transaction plus a markup, and a nominal flat fee. The exchange\nvalue is determined using real-time exchange prices and the markup percentage is determined by us and depends on the current market, competition, the geography of the\nlocation of the sale, and the method of purchase.\nOur revenue from contracts with customers is principally comprised of a single performance obligation to provide cryptocurrencies when customers buy cryptocurrencies at a\nBTM kiosk, through BDCheckout or directly via an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. BDCheckout sales are similar to sales from BTM kiosks, in that customers buy\ncryptocurrencies with cash; however, the BDCheckout transactions are completed at the checkout counter of retail locations, initiated using the Bitcoin Depot mobile app\ninstead of through the BTM kiosks. OTC sales are initiated and completed through our website. Regardless of the method by which the customer purchases the cryptocurrency,\nwe consider our performance obligation satisfied when control of the cryptocurrency is transferred to the customer, which is at the point in time the cryptocurrency is\ntransferred to the customer’s cryptocurrency wallet and the transaction is validated on the blockchain.\nThe typical process time for our transactions with customers is 30 minutes or less. Through December 31, 2022, for reasons of operational practicality, the Company applied an\naccounting convention at period-ends to use the date of the transaction, which corresponded to the timing of the cash received, for purposes of recognizing revenue. This\naccounting convention did not result in materially different revenue recognition from using the time the cryptocurrency had transferred to the customer’s wallet and the\ntransaction validated on the blockchain (see Note 6). Contract liabilities are amounts received from customers in advance of the Company transferring the cryptocurrencies to\nthe customer’s wallet and the transaction validated on the blockchain. Contract liabilities are presented in “Deferred revenue” on the consolidated Balance Sheets and are not\nmaterial as of December 31, 2023.\n79\nTable of Contents\nAccounting for PIPE Financing, including Subscription Receivable\nConcurrently with the closing of the business combination, the Company entered into the PIPE Financing for which the Subscribers purchased 4,300,000 shares of Series A\nPreferred Stock in exchange for a subscription receivable (“Subscription Receivable”). As described in Note 4 of consolidated financial statements, the Subscription Receivable\nrepresents a hybrid financial instrument comprising a subscription receivable and an embedded derivative. The embedded derivative represents a net cash settled forward\ncontract with a value that is indexed to the trading price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The derivative will be carried at its fair value with changes in fair value\nrecognized in earnings.\nThe fair value of the embedded derivative was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate potential changes in share price and the resulting impact on the amount of\ncash to be collected under the PIPE Agreement. The fair value of the embedded derivative was then determined by comparing (1) the best estimate of the cash to be collected at\nthe valuation date using this simulation compared to (ii) the cash that would be collected under a hypothetical host contract that assumes the share price did not change since the\ndate of initial recognition (both on a present value basis). The fair value was considered to be a level 2 fair value as there were no significant unobservable inputs.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock was recorded at fair value of $13.9 million. The excess of the fair value the Series A Preferred Stock over the fair value of the Subscription\nReceivable was deemed to reflect the minimum return promised to the Subscribers, and therefore the Company determined that the difference between the fair value the Series\nA Preferred Stock and the fair value of the Subscription Receivable, along with certain fees, should be recognized as an expense at the date of the initial recognition.\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company settled the Pipe Financing. For the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company recognized an expense of $15.2 million which was\nincluded within other (expense) income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTax Receivable Agreement Liability\nAs described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is party to the Tax Receivable Agreement under which we are generally required to pay BT\nAssets 85% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes that we realize. The Company recognized a liability under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement of approximately $0.9 million in connection with the business combination. This amount does not take into account any future exchanges of BT HoldCo Common\nUnits by BT Assets pursuant to the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement. The future amounts payable, as well as the timing of any\npayments, under the Tax Receivable Agreement are dependent upon significant future events and estimates, which are described in further detail under the Related Party\nTransactions Section below.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe assess legal contingencies in accordance with ASC 450—Contingencies and determines whether a legal contingency is probable, reasonably possible or remote. When\ncontingencies become probable and can be reasonably estimated, we record an estimate of the probable loss. When contingencies are considered probable or reasonably\npossible but cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose the contingency when the probable or reasonably possible loss could be material.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time in the regular course of our business, we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters. Except as noted below, there are no\nmaterial legal proceedings pending or known by us to be contemplated to which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject to.\nWe believe that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably estimable. These\ncontingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and we are unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued. We do not believe that the\nultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows\nor liquidity in a given quarter or year.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\n80\nTable of Contents\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nAccounting Pronouncement Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract\nLiabilities from Contracts with Customers,” which requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business\ncombination as if the acquiring entity had originated the contracts. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,\nbeginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this accounting standard effective January 1, 2023 with no impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the SEC issued SAB No. 121 (SAB 121), “Accounting for obligations to safeguard crypto-assets an entity holds for platform users,” which adds interpretive\nguidance requiring an entity to consider when they have obligations to safeguard crypto-assets held for their platform users. The Company adopted SAB 121 as of June 30,\n2022 with retrospective application as of January 1, 2022. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,”\nwhich clarifies that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities and requires additional disclosures for equity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company\nadopted this update effective January 1, 2024 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncement Pending Adoption\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06 \"Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC's Disclosures Update and Simplification\nInitiative\". The guidance amends certain disclosure and presentation requirements related to the statement of cash flows, accounting changes and error corrections, earnings per\nshare, interim reporting, commitments, debt, equity, derivatives, transfers and services and various industry specific guidance. For entities subject to the SEC's existing\ndisclosure requirements, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC's removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K\nbecomes effective. However, if by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the existing disclosure requirements, the amendments will not become effective. Early adoption is\nnot permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the overall impact of adopting this guidance on its disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\". The amendments require entities to\ndisclose significant segment expenses impacting profit and loss that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. In addition, the amendments enhance interim\ndisclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for\nentities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The update is required to be applied retrospectively to prior periods presented, based on the\nsignificant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The amendments are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is still assessing the impacts to its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires companies to break out their income tax\nexpense, income tax rate reconciliation and income tax payments made in more detail. For public companies, the requirements will become effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is still assessing the impacts to its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08 \"Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets\".\nASU 2023-08 will require entities to measure crypto assets that meet the scope criteria at fair value and to reflect changes in fair value in net income each reporting period. The\namendments in ASU 2023-08 will also require entities to present crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other intangible assets on the balance sheet and changes in\nthe fair value measurement of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets on the income statement. The amendments in the ASU are\neffective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and\nannual financial statements that have not yet been issued (or made available for issuance). The Company is still assessing the impacts to its consolidated financial statements.\n81\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. The term\n“market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in cryptocurrency prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected\nfuture losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk\nexposures.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nCertain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies. Consequently, a portion of our revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates on cash residing in the kiosks. We have not historically hedged our translation risk on foreign currency exposure, but we may do so in the future. For the year\nended December 31, 2023, and for the year ended December 31, 2022, currency exchange rate fluctuations had an insignificant impact on our consolidated revenues.\nGenerally, the functional currency of our various subsidiaries is their local currency except BitAccess whose functional currency is USD. We are exposed to currency\nfluctuations on transactions that are not denominated in the functional currency. Gains and losses on such transactions are included in determining net income for the period. We\nmay seek to mitigate our foreign currency risk through timely settlement of transactions and cash flow matching, when possible. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, our transaction gains and losses were insignificant.\nWe are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on our investments in foreign operations. Relative to our net investment in foreign operations, the assets and liabilities of\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the period end rate of exchange. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of\nother comprehensive income and is included in Stockholders' equity.\nAdoption and Market Price of Cryptocurrency\nOur business is dependent on the broader use and adoption of Bitcoin, which can to an extent be impacted by the spot price of the cryptocurrency we sell. Bitcoin is our sole\ncryptocurrency offering. Bitcoin represents 99% of our total transaction volume for the year ended December 31, 2023, with the remaining cryptocurrencies accounting for the\nremaining less than 1% of transaction volume. As the adoption of cryptocurrency continues to grow for the general public, we expect continued growth from our addressable\nmarket. The prices of cryptocurrencies, including the cryptocurrencies we sell, have experienced substantial volatility, and high or low prices may have little or no relationship\nto identifiable market forces, may be subject to rapidly changing investor sentiment, and may be influenced by factors such as technology, regulatory void or changes,\nfraudulent actors, manipulation and media reporting. Bitcoin (as well as other cryptocurrency) may have value based on various factors, including their acceptance as a means\nof exchange by consumers and producers, scarcity, and market demand.\nEquipment Costs\nThe cost of new kiosks can be impacted significantly by inflation, supply constraints, and labor shortages, and could be significantly higher than our fair value for new kiosks.\nAs a result, at times, we may obtain kiosks or other hardware from third parties at higher prices, to the extent they are available.\nCompetition\nIn addition to factors underlying kiosk business growth and profitability, our success greatly depends on our ability to compete. The markets in which we compete are highly\ncompetitive, and we face a variety of current and potential competitors that may have larger and more established customer bases and substantially greater financial,\noperational, marketing, and other resources than we have. The digital financial system is highly innovative, rapidly evolving, and characterized by healthy competition,\nexperimentation, changing customer needs, frequent introductions of new products, and subject to uncertain and evolving industry and regulatory requirements. We expect\ncompetition to intensify as existing and new competitors introduce new products and services or enhance existing ones. We compete against a number of companies operating\nboth within the United States and abroad, including traditional financial institutions, financial technology companies and brokerage firms that have entered the cryptocurrency\nmarket in recent years, digital and mobile payment companies offering overlapping features targeted at our users, and companies focused on cryptocurrencies. To stay\ncompetitive in the evolving digital financial system, both against new entrants into the market and existing competitors, we anticipate that we will have to continue to offer\ncompetitive features and functionalities and keep up with technological advances at fair prices to our users relative to our competitors.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n82\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors\nBitcoin Depot Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bitcoin Depot Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nrelated consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and member’s equity,\nstatement of changes in member’s equity, and statements of cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related\nnotes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year\nperiod ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to\nhave, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\nand performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nApril 15, 2024\n83\nITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1) Organization and Background\n(a) Organization\nLux Vending, LLC (dba Bitcoin Depot) (“Legacy Bitcoin Depot”) was formed on June 7, 2016. Pursuant to a transaction with GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. (“GSRM”),\na Delaware corporation formed on October 14, 2021, Legacy Bitcoin Depot merged with and into GSRM and GSRM was renamed Bitcoin Depot Inc. (“Bitcoin Depot”, or\nthe “Company”) (see Note 2(a)). Bitcoin Depot owns and operates a network of cryptocurrency kiosks (“BTMs”) across North America where customers can buy and sell\ncryptocurrencies. In addition to the BTM network, Bitcoin Depot also sells cryptocurrency to consumers at a network of retail locations through its BDCheckout product\noffering and through its website via over-the-counter (“OTC”) trade. The BDCheckout offering allows users similar functionality to the BTM kiosks, enabling users to load\ncash into their accounts at the checkout counter at retailer locations, and use those funds to purchase cryptocurrency. The Company’s website allows users to initiate and\ncomplete OTC trades for cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Depot also offers a software solution to other BTM operators through its controlled subsidiary, BitAccess Inc (\"BitAccess\").\n(b) Background\nSeveral factors affect the price of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to: (a) global supply and demand; (b) investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;\n(c) interest rates; (d) currency exchange rates, including the rates at which cryptocurrencies may be exchanged for fiat currencies; (e) fiat currency withdrawal and deposit\npolicies of electronic market places where traders may buy and sell cryptocurrencies based on bid-ask trading activity with the various exchanges and the liquidity of those\nexchanges; (f) interruptions in service from or failures of major cryptocurrency exchanges; (g) investment and trading activities of large investors, including private and\nregistered funds, that may directly or indirectly invest in cryptocurrencies; (h) monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations; (i)\nregulatory measures, if any, that restrict the use of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment; (j) the maintenance and development of the open-source protocol governing the\ncryptocurrency’s network; (k) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; and (l) expectations among market participants that the value of a\ncryptocurrency will soon change; (m) the reduction in mining rewards of Bitcoin, including block reward halving events, which are events that occur after a specific period of\ntime and reduces the block reward earned by miners.\nGlobal supply for a particular cryptocurrency is determined by the asset’s network source code, which sets the rate at which assets may be awarded to network participants.\nGlobal demand for cryptocurrencies is influenced by such factors as the increase in acceptance by retail merchants and commercial businesses of a cryptocurrency as a\npayment alternative, the security of online exchanges and digital wallets, the perception that the use of cryptocurrencies is safe and secure, and the lack of regulatory\nrestrictions on their use. Additionally, there is no assurance that any cryptocurrency will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power. Any of these events could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and the results of its operations.\n(c) Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had current assets of $37.3 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $29.8 million, current liabilities of $46.0 million, total\nstockholders’ equity and member's equity of $9.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $32.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized net\nincome of $1.5 million and generated cash flows from operations of $41.1 million. The Company expects its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided\nby operations, to be sufficient to fund its operations for a period of 12 months from the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued.\n(d) Risks and Uncertainties\nThe operations of Bitcoin Depot are subject to various regulatory challenges and uncertainties. The Company's ability to operate and expand its cryptocurrency kiosk services\nin compliance with applicable laws and regulations is a significant risk factor that may impact its financial performance and overall business prospects. The regulatory\nlandscape surrounding cryptocurrencies, including the operation of crypto kiosks, is rapidly evolving and can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. The impacts\nof heightened regulatory oversight is not yet known. For example, recent legislation in California regulates digital financial asset transaction kiosks (“crypto kiosks”) by\nimposing the following: limiting to $1,000\n-91-\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nper day the amount of funds the kiosk operator can accept from or dispense at its crypto kiosks; limiting the direct and indirect charges an operator may collect from a\ncustomer for a single transaction to the greater of $5 or 15% of the dollar equivalent of the digital assets involved in the transaction; (iii) requiring that specific information\n(including the amount of fees, expenses and charges, as well as any spread between the dollar price of the digital asset charged to the customer and the dollar price for that\nasset listed by a digital asset exchange) be disclosed both prior to a transaction and on transaction receipts printed by crypto kiosks following the transaction; and (iv) requiring\noperators to provide the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation with a list of all locations of the crypto kiosks that the operator owns, operates or\nmanages in California. Other state agencies may propose and adopt new regulations (or interpret existing regulations) in ways that could result in significant adverse changes\nin the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, regardless of whether these or other new laws are adopted.\nThe Company's financial performance and ability to achieve its business objectives may be significantly impacted by the outcome of ongoing regulatory discussions and\npotential changes in the regulatory framework governing cryptocurrencies in California and in other states that have passed, or may pass, similar legislation. These\nuncertainties may result in increased compliance costs, operational restrictions, or limitations on the Company's ability to expand its services or enter new markets.\nCompliance with current and proposed legislation that has not yet been published may be more challenging than expected.\nIn addition, the Company's ability to obtain and maintain the necessary licenses, permits, and approvals from state regulatory authorities is subject to various factors beyond\nits control, including changes in laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in penalties, fines, or even the suspension or\ntermination of the Company's operations in the state.\n(2) Basis of Presentation Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Presentation\nReverse Recapitalization\nGSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. (“GSRM”) was a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on October 14, 2021, for the purpose of effecting a\nmerger or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On March 1, 2022, GSRM consummated its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). On August 24, 2022,\nGSRM entered into a Transaction Agreement, as subsequently amended (the “Transaction Agreement”), by and among GSRM, GSR II Meteora Sponsor LLC (the\n“Sponsor”), Lux Vending, LLC (dba Bitcoin Depot), and BT Assets, Inc. (“BT Assets”). Prior to the events contemplated in the Transaction Agreement (collectively, the\n\"Merger\"), BT Assets was the sole owner and member in Legacy Bitcoin Depot (the \"Member\").\nOn June 30, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), Legacy Bitcoin Depot merged with and into Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC (“BT OpCo”), with BT OpCo surviving the Merger as\nthe post-transaction operating company owned solely by a newly formed entity, BT HoldCo, LLC (“BT HoldCo”) with common units (the “BT HoldCo Common Units”),\npreferred units (the “BT HoldCo Preferred Units”) and earnout units (the “BT HoldCo Earnout Units”) outstanding and issued to BT Assets. In connection with the Merger,\nGSRM changed its name to Bitcoin Depot Inc., purchased BT HoldCo Common Units owned by BT Assets and was issued BT HoldCo Earnout Units and warrants issued\nby BT HoldCo to the Company to purchase a number of BT HoldCo Common Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock that may be purchased upon\nthe exercise in full of all Warrants outstanding immediately after the Closing Date (“BT HoldCo Matching Warrants”). The former owners of Legacy Bitcoin Depot (i.e.,\nBT Assets and the owners thereof) were issued 44,100,000 non-economic, super voting shares of Class V common stock in Bitcoin Depot. The Class V common stock held\nby BT Assets corresponds to units held by BT Assets in BT HoldCo and represents non-controlling interests in the Company, as described in Note 11. Following the\nClosing Date, the Company is organized under an “Up-C” structure in which the business of the Company is operated by BT HoldCo and its subsidiaries, and Bitcoin\nDepot’s only material direct asset consists of equity interests in BT HoldCo. At June 30, 2023, the Company had issued and outstanding 12,358,691 common units,\n4,300,000 Series A Preferred Units and 43,848,750 warrants in BT HoldCo. Also at June 30, 2023, BT Assets owned 41,200,000 common units, 2,900,000 Founder\nPreferred Units, 5,000,000 Class 1 Earnout Units, 5,000,000 Class 2 Earnout Units and 5,000,000 Class 3 Earnout Units in BT HoldCo.\nOn the Closing Date, the Company also issued 4,300,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) in connection\nwith the private placement (“PIPE Financing”) discussed in Note 4, and 12,358,691 shares of Class A common stock.\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Merger pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Merger is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. The Merger is accounted\nfor as a common control transaction and reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S.\n92\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), as BT Assets controls BT OpCo both before and after the transactions. Legacy Bitcoin Depot is determined to be\nthe predecessor and represents a continuation of BT OpCo’s balance sheet and consolidated statement of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss), reflective of\nthe recapitalization of the Merger.\nAs a result of the reverse capitalization accounting, the consolidated assets and liabilities of Legacy Bitcoin Depot are reflected by the Company at their historical cost with\nno additional goodwill or intangible assets recorded, accompanied by a recapitalization of the equity structure. The Company has reflected the recapitalization within the\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity and Member's Equity.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company’s Class A common stock is now listed on the Nasdaq stock market under the symbol BTM and the Warrants to purchase the\nClass A common stock are listed on the Nasdaq stock market under the symbol BTMWW in lieu of the GSRM Ordinary Shares and GSRM’s warrants, respectively.\nGSRM’s units automatically separated into the GSRM’s Ordinary Shares and GSRM’s warrants and ceased trading separately on the Nasdaq stock market following the\nClosing Date. Prior to the Merger, GSRM neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue. Until the Merger, based on GSRM’s business activities, it was a\nshell company as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nThe consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations prior to the Merger reflect those of Legacy Bitcoin Depot, which represents the predecessor of the Company. All\nsuch references to the Company for periods prior to the Merger refer to the activity of Lux Vending, LLC.\nThe Company consolidates business enterprises that it controls by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required\neven though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. An enterprise must consolidate a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”)\nif it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact\nthe entity’s economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The\nCompany consolidates all entities that it controls by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company became the sole managing member of BT HoldCo, which holds all of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, and has the sole\nauthority to make the key operating decisions on behalf of BT HoldCo. As such, the Company determined that BT HoldCo is a VIE and the Company is the primary\nbeneficiary. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of BT HoldCo.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Bitcoin Depot Inc. and its controlled subsidiaries: BT HoldCo, Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC,\nMintz Assets, Inc., Express Vending, Inc., Intuitive Software, LLC, Digital Gold Ventures, Inc. (“Digital Gold”), and BitAccess Inc. BT HoldCo is a holding company with\nownership of Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC. Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC is a holding company with ownership of Mintz Assets, Inc. and Intuitive Software, LLC. Mintz\nAssets, Inc. is a holding company that holds the ownership of Express Vending, Inc. Express Vending, Inc. is a Canadian corporation whose business activities include owning\nand operating a network of BTM kiosks in Canada. Intuitive Software, LLC is a holding company that holds an 82.14% equity interest (through its ownership of Digital Gold)\nin BitAccess Inc., a Canadian corporation. The non-controlling interests held by investors directly in BT HoldCo and BitAccess are presented separately as further discussed\nin Note 11. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n(b) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, valuation of current and deferred income taxes, the determination of the useful lives of\nproperty and equipment, recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, fair value of long-term debt, present value of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, assumptions and\ninputs for fair value measurements used in business combinations and in the transaction, impairments of cryptocurrencies, share-based compensation, and contingencies,\nincluding liabilities that the Company deems are not probable of assertion. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that\nare believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n93\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(c) Concentration of Credit Risk Arising from Cash Deposits in Excess of Insured Limits\nThe Company maintains cash in established U.S. and Canadian financial institutions that often will exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any\nlosses in such accounts that are maintained at the financial institutions.\nThe Company maintains cash balances in its BTMs and in fiat wallets with cryptocurrency exchanges to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies. The cash\nbalances in the BTMs are insured up to a specified limit. From time to time, the Company’s cash balance in the BTMs exceeds such limits. The Company had cash of $12.2\nmillion and $16.0 million in BTMs at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Cash maintained in fiat wallets with cryptocurrency exchanges is not\ninsured. The Company had $0.1 million and $2.5 million in cash with cryptocurrency exchanges as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nA significant customer concentration is defined as one from whom at least 10% of annual revenue is derived. The Company had no significant customer concentration for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash maintained at various financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, cash in transit, and cash in BTMs owned and leased by the\nCompany.\nCash in transit consists of cash that is picked up by armored truck companies from the Company’s BTM machines but not yet deposited in the Company’s bank accounts.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had cash in transit of $5.3 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Management evaluates cash in transit\nbased on outstanding cash deposits on cash picked up by the armored truck companies, historical cash deposits and cash that is lost during transit, which is immaterial. The\narmored truck companies maintain insurance over theft and losses.\n(e) Cryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrencies are a unit of account that function as a medium of exchange on a respective blockchain network, and a digital and decentralized ledger that keeps a record\nof all transactions that take place across a peer-to-peer network. The Company primarily purchases cryptocurrencies to sell to customers. The Company’s cryptocurrencies\nconsisted primarily of Bitcoin (“BTC”) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and BTC, Litecoin (“LTC”), and Ethereum (“ETH”) as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. These are collectively referred to as “cryptocurrencies” in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company accounts for cryptocurrencies as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Intangibles -\nGoodwill and Other, and they are recorded on the Company’s consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, less any impairments. The Company has control and ownership of its\ncryptocurrencies which are stored in both the Company’s proprietary hot wallets and hot wallets hosted by a third-party, BitGo, Inc.\nThe primary purpose of the Company’s operations is to buy and sell Bitcoin using the BTM kiosk network and other services. The Company does not engage in broker-\ndealer activities. The Company uses various exchanges and liquidity providers to purchase, liquidate and manage its cryptocurrency positions; however, this does not\nimpact the accounting for these assets as intangible assets.\nCrypto Custody Asset and Safeguarding Liability\nIn accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), the Company determined that it has a safeguarding obligation with respect to cryptocurrencies held in third-\nparty operator wallets and in a shared wallet with one of its liquidity providers. The Company has certain obligations to safeguard these assets and/or private keys from\nloss, theft, or other misuse. The Company has adopted measures to safeguard crypto assets it secures, including establishing security around private key management to\nminimize the risk of theft or loss. The Company measures the safeguarding obligation liability initially and subsequently at the fair value of the digital asset per the principal\nmarket in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, at midnight UTC on the last day of the reporting period. The custody asset is measured in the same manner,\nhowever, the carrying amount may be adjusted to reflect any actual or potential safeguarding loss events, such as those resulting from fraud or theft.\n94\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nImpairment\nBecause the Company’s cryptocurrencies are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, the cryptocurrencies are tested for impairment annually or more frequently\nif events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired in accordance with ASC 350. The Company has determined that a decline\nin the quoted market price below the carrying value at any time during the assessed period is viewed as an impairment indicator because the cryptocurrencies are traded in\nactive markets where there are observable prices. Therefore, the fair value is used to assess whether an impairment loss should be recorded. If the fair value of the\ncryptocurrency decreases below the initial cost basis or the carrying value during the assessed period, an impairment charge is recognized at that time in cost of revenue\n(excluding depreciation and amortization). After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of the cryptocurrency becomes its new accounting basis\nand this new cost basis will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value. For purposes of measuring impairment on its cryptocurrencies, the Company\ndetermines the fair value of its cryptocurrency on a non-recurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on quoted (unadjusted) prices on an\nactive exchange in the United States that the Company has determined is its principal market (Level 1 inputs).\nThe Company purchases cryptocurrencies, which are held in the Company’s hot wallets, on a just-in-time basis to facilitate sales to customers and mitigate exposure to\nvolatility in cryptocurrency prices. After June 30, 2022, the Company only sells its cryptocurrencies to its customers from its BTM kiosks and BDCheckout locations in\nexchange for cash, for a prescribed transaction fee applied to the current market price of the cryptocurrency at the time of the transaction, plus a predetermined markup.\nWhen the cryptocurrency is sold to customers, the Company relieves the adjusted cost basis of its cryptocurrency, on a first-in, first-out basis within cost of revenue\n(excluding depreciation and amortization). In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company discontinued the sale of ETH and LTC to its customers.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased quantities of cryptocurrencies in excess of expected sales and began selling these cryptocurrencies to\ncustomers, on exchange or distributing to the Member during the year ended December 31, 2022. Upon disposition, the Company relieved the adjusted cost basis of the\ncryptocurrencies with any gains recorded to cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization).\nThe related cash flows from purchases and sales of cryptocurrencies are presented as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nSee Notes 2(i) and 2(j) to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s revenue recognition and cost of revenue related to the\nCompany’s cryptocurrencies.\n(f) Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Finance leases for kiosk machines are stated at the present value of the future minimum lease\npayments, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of assets sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, and\nthe related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from their respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated Statements of Income\n(Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) upon disposition.\nDepreciation of property and equipment is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\nFurniture and fixtures 7 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or life of the lease\nKiosk machines - owned 5 years\nKiosk machines - leased 2-5 years\nVehicles 5 years\nDepreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 totaled $11.3 million, and $17.3 million, respectively.\n95\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(g) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to its fair value, which is normally determined through\nanalysis of the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If such asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured\nby the amount that the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. There were no impairments of long-lived assets for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(h) Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and any non-controlling interest in the\nacquired entity in a business combination. The Company tests for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company performs their annual test for impairment as of December 31 at the\nreporting unit level. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIntangible assets, net consist of tradenames, customer relationships, and software applications. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated lives and\nevaluated for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that warrants such a review. Management periodically evaluates whether changes to estimated\nuseful lives of intangible assets are necessary to ensure its estimates accurately reflect the economic use of the related intangible assets.\n(i) Revenue Recognition\nBTM Kiosks, BDCheckout and OTC\nRevenue is principally derived from the sale of cryptocurrencies at the point-of-sale on transactions initiated by customers. These customer-initiated transactions are\ngoverned by terms and conditions agreed to at the time of each point-of-sale transaction and do not extend beyond the transaction. The Company charges a fee at the\ntransaction level. The transaction price for the customer is the price of the cryptocurrency, which is based on the exchange value at the time of the transaction, plus a\nmarkup, and a flat fee. The exchange value is determined using real-time exchange prices and the markup percentage is determined by the Company and depends on the\ncurrent market, competition, the geography of the location of the sale, and the method of purchase.\nThe Company’s revenue from contracts with customers is principally comprised of a single performance obligation to provide cryptocurrencies when customers buy\ncryptocurrencies at a BTM kiosk, through BDCheckout or directly via an OTC trade. The Company discontinued its OTC sales in June 2022. BDCheckout sales are similar\nto sales from BTM kiosks in that, customers buy cryptocurrencies with cash; however, the BDCheckout transactions are completed at the checkout counter of retail\nlocations, initiated using the Bitcoin Depot mobile app instead of through the BTM kiosks. OTC sales were initiated and completed through the Company’s website.\nRegardless of the method by which the customer purchases the cryptocurrency, the Company considers its performance obligation satisfied when control of the\ncryptocurrency is transferred to the customer, which is at the point in time the cryptocurrency is transferred to the customer’s cryptocurrency wallet and the transaction is\nvalidated on the blockchain.\nThe typical processing time for the Company's transactions with customers is 30 minutes or less. Through December 31, 2022, for reasons of operational practicality, the\nCompany applied an accounting convention at period-ends to use the date of the transaction, which corresponded to the timing of the cash received, for purposes of\nrecognizing revenue. The net impact from this accounting convention was a $0.1 million increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Contract liabilities are\namounts received from customers in advance of the Company transferring the cryptocurrencies to the customer’s wallet and the transaction validated on the blockchain.\nContract liabilities are presented in “Deferred revenue” on the consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 are not material.\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with customers. The Company evaluates the presentation of revenue\non a gross or net basis based on whether it controls the cryptocurrency before control is transferred to the customer (gross) or whether it acts as an agent by arranging for\nother customers on the platform to provide the cryptocurrency to the customer (net). The Company controls the cryptocurrency before it is transferred to the customer, has\nownership risk related to the cryptocurrency (including market price volatility), sets the transaction fee to be charged, and is responsible for transferring the cryptocurrency\nto the customer upon purchase. Therefore, the Company is the principal in transactions with customers and presents revenue and cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and\namortization) from the sale of cryptocurrencies on a gross basis.\n96\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn a limited number of BTM kiosks, the Company has technology that allows customers to sell their cryptocurrencies to the Company. In these limited cases, the Company\nreceives the customer’s cryptocurrencies in the Company’s hot wallet, and the kiosk dispenses U.S. Dollar (“USD”) to the selling customer. Because all orders are processed\nwithin a very short time frame (typically within minutes), no orders are pending when the customer receives cash upon completion of the transaction at the kiosk.\nTransaction fee revenue is recognized at the time the cash is dispensed to the customer. The cryptocurrencies are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, they are measured\nat cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition, and reflected in Cryptocurrencies on the consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSoftware Services\nThe Company, through its subsidiary BitAccess, generates revenue from contracts with third-party BTM operators to provide software services that enables these customers\nto operate their own BTM kiosks and facilitate customer cash-to-cryptocurrency transactions. In exchange for these software services, the Company earns a variable fee\nequal to a percentage of the cash value of the transactions processed by the kiosks using the software during the month, paid in BTC. The Company has determined that the\nsoftware services are a single, series performance obligation to provide continuous access to the transaction processing system that is simultaneously provided to and\nconsumed by the customer. Each day of the service periods comprises a distinct, stand-ready service that is substantially the same and with the same pattern of transfer to\nthe customer as all the other days. The Company allocates the variable service fees earned to each distinct service period on the basis that (a) each variable service fee\nearned relates specifically to the entity’s efforts to provide the software services during that period and (b) allocation of the variable fee entirely to the distinct period in\nwhich the transaction giving rise to the fee occurred is consistent with the allocation objective in ASC 606. Accordingly, the Company allocates and recognizes variable\nsoftware services revenue in the period in which the transactions giving rise to the earned variable fee occur.\nBitAccess also generates revenue by selling kiosk hardware to BTM operators in exchange for cash. Hardware revenue is recognized at a point-in-time when the hardware is\nshipped to the customer and control is transferred to the customer. When customers pay in advance for the kiosk hardware, the Company records deferred revenue until the\nhardware is delivered and control is transferred to the customer. Hardware and software services are generally sold separately from each other and are distinct from each\nother.\nThe Company has considered whether its contracts with BitAccess customers for software services are themselves derivative contracts or contain an embedded derivative in\naccordance with ASC 815 - Derivatives and Hedging, because the Company elects to receive BTC as payment for these software fees. The Company determined that the\ncontracts are not themselves derivative contracts in their entirety but do contain an embedded derivative for the right to receive the USD denominated receivable in BTC as\nsettlement. Due to the immaterial amount of BTC not received as settlement of receivables from customers at each month end, the fair value of the embedded derivative was\ndetermined to be de minimis.\n(j) Cost of Revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)\nThe Company’s cost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs related to selling cryptocurrencies and operating the Company’s network of BTM kiosks. The cost of\nrevenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) caption includes cryptocurrency expenses, floorspace expenses, and kiosk operations expenses.\nCryptocurrency expenses\nCryptocurrency expenses include the cost of cryptocurrencies, fees paid to obtain cryptocurrencies, impairment of cryptocurrencies, gains on sales of cryptocurrencies on\nexchange, fees paid to operate the third-party software on the BTM kiosks, and fees paid to transfer cryptocurrencies to customers.\nFloorspace lease expenses\nFloorspace lease expenses include lease expenses for floorspace leases related to the placement of BTM kiosks.\nKiosk Operations expenses\nKiosk operations expenses include the cost of kiosk repair and maintenance and the cost of armored trucks to collect and transport cash deposited into the BTM kiosks.\n97\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company presents cost of revenue in the consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) exclusive of depreciation related to BTM kiosks\nand amortization of intangible assets related to software applications, tradenames and customer relationships.\n(k) Advertising\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses were $5.6 million and $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAmounts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(l) Foreign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company is the USD. The functional currency of Express Vending, Inc. is the Canadian Dollar. All revenue, cost and expense accounts\nrecorded in foreign currencies are translated at an average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated\nat the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of Stockholders’ and Member’s Equity,\nidentified as accumulated other comprehensive loss. As a result of the integration of BitAccess (the Company’s controlled Canadian subsidiary) during 2022, the\nCompany determined that the functional currency of BitAccess was the USD.\n(m) Income Taxes\nBitcoin Depot Inc. is treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.\nBT HoldCo is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC is a Single-Member Limited Liability Company and owned by BT\nHoldCo and with the consent of BT HoldCo, has elected under the Internal Revenue Code and similar state statutes to be a disregarded entity. In lieu of federal corporate\nincome taxes, Bitcoin Depot Operating, LLC reflects its operating results on BT HoldCo’s federal tax return as a division of the partnership. As such, there were no federal\nincome taxes for these entities.\nMintz Assets, Inc., is treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Intuitive Software, LLC., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Gold, are treated as\ncorporations for federal income tax purposes. BitAccess Inc., and Express Vending, Inc., are each taxed as Canadian corporations. For the year ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, there was no activity for Mintz Assets, Inc., Intuitive Software, LLC and Digital Gold. As such, there were no federal income taxes for these entities.\nDeferred taxes are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to\ntaxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe effect of any tax rate change on deferred taxes is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change. Realization of deferred tax assets is\nassessed on an annual basis and, unless a deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be utilized, a valuation allowance is recorded to write down the deferred tax assets to\ntheir net realizable value. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of\nthe deferred income tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during\nthe periods in which those deductible temporary differences reverse. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future\ntaxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. For uncertain income tax positions, the Company uses a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold\nbased on the technical merits of the income tax position taken. Income tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured in order to\ndetermine the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements. The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax\nexpense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (GILTI) is a provision that was introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. U.S. shareholders, who are domestic corporations, of\ncontrolled foreign corporations (CFCs) are eligible for up to an 80% deemed paid foreign tax credit (FTC) and a 50% deduction of the current year inclusion with the full\namount of the Section 78 gross-up subject\n98\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nto limitation. This provision was effective for tax years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2017. The Company has evaluated whether it has additional\nprovision amount resulting from the GILTI inclusion on current earnings and profits of its foreign controlled corporations. The Company has made an accounting policy\nchoice of treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable amount related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. Amounts related to the GILTI\ninclusion are not material.\n(n) Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nCertain assets and liabilities are reported or disclosed at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the Company’s principal market for such transactions. If the Company has not established a\nprincipal market for such transactions, fair value is determined based on the most advantageous market. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes fair value\nmeasurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n•Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\n•Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities,\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data\nfor substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n•Level 3: Inputs that are generally unobservable, supported by little or no market activity, and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe categorization of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation\ntechniques used by the Company when measuring fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n(o) Share-Based Compensation\nBitAccess\nThe Company maintains an equity award plan under which the officers and employees of BitAccess were awarded various types of share-based compensation, including\noptions to purchase shares of BitAccess common stock and restricted stock units.\nFor stock options, share-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant, as estimated using\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model requires management to make a number of assumptions, including the fair value\nand expected volatility of BitAccess' underlying BitAccess common stock price, expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield. The fair\nvalue of the underlying stock is estimated the fair value of BitAccess common stock on the date of grant. The expected stock price volatility assumption for BitAccess' stock\nis determined by using a weighted average of the historical stock price volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group, as BitAccess stock is not\nactively traded. The Company uses historical exercise information and contractual terms of options to estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate for periods\nwithin the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds with terms consistent with the expected term of the award at the time of grant. The\nexpected dividend yield assumption is based on BitAccess’ history and expectation of no dividend payouts.\n2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nIn conjunction with the close of the Transaction the Company established the Bitcoin Depot Inc. 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) under which officers,\ndirectors, and employees may be awarded various types of share-based compensation, including but not limited to, restricted stock, stock options, and restricted stock units.\nUnder the Incentive Plan, the Company has granted time-based and issued performance-based restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"). The Company recognizes compensation\nexpense for the RSUs in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation, (\"ASC 718\").\n99\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor RSUs, share-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the Company’s Class A common stock at the closing price on the day before the date of grant.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with time-based RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the award’s requisite service period (generally the vesting\nperiod). Share-based compensation expense associated with performance-based RSUs is determined based on the number of performance-based RSUs that are earned based\non the Company's achievement of certain adjusted EBITDA targets that are determined and approved by the Company's Compensation Committee at its sole discretion.\nForfeitures of awards granted under the Incentive Plan are accounted for at the time the forfeiture occurs.\n(p) Segment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating\nDecision Maker (the “CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the\nCompany’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a global, consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources,\nand evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment and one reportable segment, and substantially all of\nthe Company's revenues and long-lived assets are located in the U.S.\n(q) Net Income Per Share Attributable to Class A Common Stock\nBasic earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A\ncommon stock outstanding during the same period. Diluted net income per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company\nby the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities. Potential shares of common stock\nconsist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants, vesting of RSUs, vesting of Class E common stock and Class V common\nstock and conversion of the Company’s preferred stock, as applicable. Net income per share is not presented for periods prior to the Merger as such amounts would not be\nmeaningful to users of the financial statements because the equity structure materially changed in connection with the Merger.\n(r) Litigation\nThe Company assesses legal contingencies in accordance with ASC 450 - Contingencies and determines whether a legal contingency is probable, reasonably possible or\nremote. When contingencies become probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company records an estimate of the probable loss. When contingencies are considered\nprobable or reasonably possible but cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the contingency when the probable or reasonably possible loss could be material.\nLegal costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.\n(s) Earnouts\nAt the closing of the Merger, GSRM received a total of 1,075,761 earnout shares (“Sponsor Earnout Shares”) in the form of Class E common stock of the Company. In\ncurrent form, the Sponsor Earnout Shares are represented by the Company’s Class E-1, E-2, and E-3 common stock, each class comprising of one-third (1/3) of the total\nSponsor Earnout Shares, or 358,587 shares each. Class E-1 Shares automatically convert to Class A common stock if during the seven-year period following the closing of\nthe Merger, the Company’s stock price is greater than $12.00 over 10 trading days (which may be consecutive or not consecutive) within any 20 consecutive trading days\n(“First Milestone”). Class E-2 and Class E-3 are subject to similar milestones. The “Second Milestone” is reached when the Company’s stock price is greater than $14.00\nper share over any 10 trading days (which may be consecutive or not consecutive) within any 20 consecutive trading days during the seven-year period following the\nMerger. The “Third Milestone” has a threshold of $16.00 per share over any 10 trading days (which may be consecutive or not consecutive) within any 20 consecutive\ntrading days during the 10-year period following the Merger.\nIn addition to the Sponsor Earnout Shares, certain owners of BT HoldCo are entitled to receive an additional 15,000,000 BT HoldCo Earnout Units (“BT Earnout”). The BT\nEarnout is structured similarly to the Sponsor Earnout Shares with consistent milestones and vesting conditions.\nThe Company evaluated the Sponsor Earnout Shares and BT HoldCo Earnout Shares under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and\nconcluded equity classification is appropriate. As equity-classified contracts, the Sponsor Earnout Shares are not subject to remeasurement provided the conditions for\nequity-classification continue to be met. The Sponsor\n100\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEarnout Shares have been recorded in connection with the reverse recapitalization accounting as part of the adjustment to accumulated deficit due to the absence of\nadditional paid in capital.\nIn connection with the Merger, the BT Earnout will be settled in Common Units which represent non-controlling interest, to be measured under the hypothetical liquidation at\nbook value method, as described further in Note 11.\n(t) Warrants\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company assumed a total of 43,848,750 Warrants, consisting of 31,625,000 Public Warrants and 12,223,750 Private Placement Warrants\nissued by GSRM which continue to be outstanding following the Merger. The outstanding Warrants are accounted for as freestanding equity contracts and are classified in\nequity under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.\n(u) Emerging Growth Company Status\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart our\nBusiness Startups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public\ncompanies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements.\n(3) Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncement Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract\nLiabilities from Contracts with Customers,” which requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business\ncombination as if the acquiring entity had originated the contracts. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,\nbeginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this accounting standard effective January 1, 2023 with no impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the SEC issued SAB No. 121 (SAB 121), “Accounting for obligations to safeguard crypto-assets an entity holds for platform users,” which adds interpretive\nguidance requiring an entity to consider when they have obligations to safeguard crypto-assets held for their platform users. The Company adopted SAB 121 as of June 30,\n2022 with retrospective application as of January 1, 2022. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale\nRestrictions,” which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities and requires additional disclosures for equity\nsecurities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company adopted this update effective January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncement Pending Adoption\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06 \"Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC's Disclosures Update and Simplification\nInitiative\". The guidance amends certain disclosure and presentation requirements related to the statement of cash flows, accounting changes and error corrections, earnings\nper share, interim reporting, commitments, debt, equity, derivatives, transfers and services and various industry specific guidance. For entities subject to the SEC's existing\ndisclosure requirements, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC's removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K\nbecomes effective. However, if by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the existing disclosure requirements, the amendments will not become effective. Early adoption is\nnot permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the overall impact of adopting this guidance on its disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\". The amendments require entities to\ndisclose significant segment expenses impacting profit and loss that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. In addition, the amendments enhance interim\ndisclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure\n101\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrequirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The update is required to be applied retrospectively to prior periods\npresented, based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The amendments are required to be adopted for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is still assessing\nthe impacts to its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires companies to break out their income tax\nexpense, income tax rate reconciliation and income tax payments made in more detail. For public companies, the requirements will become effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is still assessing the impacts to its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08 \"Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets\".\nASU 2023-08 will require entities to measure crypto assets that meet the scope criteria at fair value and to reflect changes in fair value in net income each reporting period.\nThe amendments in ASU 2023-08 will also require entities to present crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other intangible assets on the balance sheet and\nchanges in the fair value measurement of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets on the income statement. The amendments\nin the ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for\nboth interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued (or made available for issuance). The Company is still assessing the impacts to its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n(4) Merger\nFor accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of Legacy Bitcoin Depot issuing stock for the net assets of GSRM accompanied by a recapitalization. The\nfollowing summarizes the elements of the Merger to the consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, including the transaction funding, sources and uses of cash (in thousands):\nAs of June 30, 2023\nCash - GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp Trust $ 332,102\nLess: GSRM transactions cost paid from Trust(1) (25,958)\nLess: Purchase of BT HoldCo common units from BT Assets (10,066)\nLess: Redemptions of existing shareholders of GSRM (292,735)\nNet proceeds from GSRM shareholders 3,343\nAssumed net liabilities from GSRM, excluding net cash proceeds (6,850)\nNet Impact of the Merger on the Statement of Changes in\nStockholders’ and Member's Equity $ (3,507)\n(1)Transaction costs paid from the GSRM trust account include $18.7 million of non-redemption payments, $4.9 million of other transaction-related expenses and $2.4\nmillion of franchise and income taxes, all of which were recorded by GSRM.\nPIPE Financing\nOn June 23, 2023, GSRM entered into a private placement agreement with certain subscribers (“Subscribers”). Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, the Subscribers\npurchased 4,300,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for a subscription receivable (“Subscription Receivable”). The terms of the Subscription Receivable\nprovided that the Subscribers would pay a purchase price of up to $43.3 million if the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeded certain hurdle prices\nranging from $10.50 to $11.39 per share over the period from September 2023 through February 2024 (or April 2024 if the Company elected certain extensions). The price\npaid by the Subscribers would be reduced if the trading price did not exceed the hurdle price and, if the Class A common stock trading price declined to zero, could have\nresulted in the Company making a cash payment to the Subscribers of up to $10.9 million (or $12.1 million if the Company elected to extend the observation period).\nFor purposes of determining the settlement payments under the Subscription Receivable, the notional amount of 5,000,000 shares consisted of (a) the 4,300,000 shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock sold at the closing of the Merger, and (b) 700,000 shares of Class A common stock that were held by the Subscribers prior to the consummation of\nthe Merger. The Subscribers also entered into non-redemption agreements with the Company and received additional shares of Class A common stock in exchange for their\n102\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncommitments not to redeem in connection with the Merger. See the discussion below under GSRM Share Issuance for further information.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock issued to the Subscribers was recorded in stockholders’ equity at a fair value of approximately $13.9 million based on the price of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock as the Series A Preferred Stock are convertible at any time by the Subscribers on a 1:1 basis.\nThe Subscription Receivable represented a hybrid financial instrument comprising a subscription receivable and a compound embedded derivative. The host subscription\nreceivable was recognized at fair value as a reduction to stockholders’ equity. The embedded derivative represented a net cash settled forward contract with a value that is\nindexed to the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock and was bifurcated pursuant to subtopic ASC 815-15 – Embedded derivatives and was initially recorded\nas a liability at de minimus fair value at inception, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.\nOn October 11, 2023, the PIPE Agreement was settled with the Subscribers for de minimus consideration. The effects of the settlement resulted in the elimination of the\nsubscription receivable and the embedded derivative liability with the difference being recorded as other expenses within Other (expense) income in the consolidated\nStatements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). For the year-ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $15.2 million in expenses\nrelated to the agreement including $13.9 million of expense related to the fair value of the Series A Preferred Shares and $1.3 million of other transaction-related expenses.\nNon-Redemption Agreements\nPrior to the Merger, GSRM entered into voting and non-redemption agreements (“Voting and Non-Redemption Agreements”) with unaffiliated third parties (“Non-Redeeming\nStockholders”) in exchange for such Non-Redeeming Stockholders, including the Subscribers referenced above, agreeing to either not redeem or to reverse any previously\nsubmitted redemption request with respect to an aggregate of 6,783,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock sold in its initial public offering (“Non-Redeemed\nShares”) and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to further extend the date to consummate an initial business combination on a monthly basis up to eight\ntimes by an additional one month each time after July 1, 2023 (each one month extension, a “Monthly Extension”), until March 1, 2024, unless the closing of an initial\nbusiness combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “Extension”).\nGSRM Share Issuance\nIn exchange for the commitments not to redeem such Non-Redeemed Shares, GSRM agreed to issue to the Non-Redeeming Stockholders an aggregate of 67,830 shares\n(“Commitment Shares”) (representing 1% of the Non-Redeemed Shares) of the Company’s Class A common stock. The Non-Redeeming Stockholders also received 135,660\nshares (“Extension Shares”) of the Company’s Class A common stock in connection with the initial extension. Additionally, a backstop fee was paid immediately upon closing\nof the Merger, which was paid to all Non-Redeeming Stockholders, except for one investor, to which the Company paid the backstop fee in the form of 454,350 shares of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock. In total, the Company issued 657,840 shares of Class A common stock at the closing of the Merger and $18.7 million of cash was paid\nout of the SPAC trust account proceeds. The cash paid by GSRM to Non-Redeeming Stockholders of $18.7 million reduced GSRM’s trust account balance at closing of the\nMerger. In connection with the reverse recapitalization, the Company recorded the remaining trust account balance and other net liabilities as an adjustment to accumulated\ndeficit on the consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity and Member's Equity. The expenses related to the Non-Redemption Agreements\nand the GSRM Share Issuance described above have been recognized in the GSRM Statement of Operations as these transactions occurred prior to the Merger.\nBonus Agreements\nThe Company entered into sale bonus agreements with an officer and an employee of Bitcoin Depot as part of the Merger and agreed to pay bonuses to these individuals based\non the results of the Merger. The Company paid in cash an aggregate bonus compensation of $0.8 million as of year end December 31, 2023 and granted 120,500 restricted\nstock units related to the sale bonus agreement. The compensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated Statements of\nIncome (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, as part of the closing of the Transaction, the Company issued 500,000 Class A Common shares to the Chief\nExecutive Officer.

Total cash distributions made to BT Assets during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $15.0 million and $11.4 million, respectively and are classified as cash outflows from financing activities in the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total cash and non-cash distributions are reflected in the consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity and\nMember's Equity.\nAt the closing of the Merger, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with by and among Bitcoin Depot Inc, HoldCo, and BT Assets. Pursuant to the Tax\nReceivable Agreement, the Company is generally required to pay BT Assets 85% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes that\nthe Company realizes, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize. See Note 18. Income Taxes for further discussion.\nIn connection with the closing of the Merger, the Company entered into separate indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. These agreements,\namong other things, require the Company to indemnify its directors and executive officers for certain costs, charges and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines\nand settlement amounts, reasonably incurred by a director or executive officer in any action or proceeding because of their association with the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries. No amounts have been recognized related to these agreements as of December 31, 2023.\nOn September 28, 2023, the Company entered into an advisory agreement with SPAC Advisory Partners, LLC (\"SAP\"). The agreement is for capital markets advice. SAP is\nmanaged by the same investment professionals that managed GSRM prior to the Merger.

During the\nyear-ended December 31, 2022, the Company made the first year payment of $2.0 million to the former owners of BitAccess as the performance conditions were determined\nto have been met. In addition, the Company amended the contingent consideration arrangement to remove the performance conditions for the second year payment such that\nthe full $2.0 million related to the second year payment would be paid out in accordance with the agreement on July 31, 2023. As a result of the change in the agreement, the\ncontingent liability changed from Level 3 to Level 1, in accordance with ASC 820. The change in fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized in interest expense in\nthe consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The difference between the recorded fair\nvalue of the payments and the ultimate payment amounts was not material to any period. In July 2023, in accordance with the BitAccess acquisition agreement, the Company\npaid $2.0 million to settle the remaining contingent consideration.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and cryptocurrencies are adjusted down\nto fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Certain fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs. No impairment charges related to\ngoodwill, intangible assets, operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment have been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe carrying value of the Company’s cryptocurrency reflects any impairment charges recorded since its purchase or receipt.\nThe Company's safeguarding liability and corresponding asset are valued using quoted prices on the principal market which are Level 1 inputs. The Company was not aware\nof any actual or possible safeguarding loss events as of December 31, 2023, and accordingly, the bitcoin safeguarding obligation liability and the corresponding asset were\nrecorded at the same value. The fair value of the safeguarding asset and liability is recognized in Prepaid and other current assets and Accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, see Note 9 and 10, respectively. Due to the change in fair values of the cryptocurrency and the variability of quantity held at\neach reporting period, the Company anticipates these balances could change significantly at the end of each reporting period.\nAssets and Liabilities Not Measured and Recorded at Fair Value\nThe Company considers the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses (excluding contingent consideration) in\nthe consolidated financial statements to approximate fair value due to their short maturities.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its fixed-rated notes payable based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input. As\nof December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the fixed-rated notes was approximately $22.1 million and the carrying value was $21.1 million.\n(9) Prepaid and Other Current Assets\nThe following table presents Prepaid and other current assets (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nPrepaid expenses $ 2,334 $ 1,328\nCryptocurrency safeguarding asset 3,040 —\nOther current assets 1,180 687\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 6,554 $ 2,015\n106\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(10) Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nThe following table presents Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nPayables to liquidity providers $ 5,143 $ 1,665\nCryptocurrency safeguarding liability 3,040\n—\nEarnout liability — 1,841\nAccrued expenses 13,362 7,803\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 21,545 $ 11,309\n(11) Non-controlling Interests\nThe following table presents the changes in the balances of non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nBitAccess BT HoldCo Total\nBeginning balance January 1, 2022 $ 1,432 $ — $ 1,432\nStock compensation 1,230 — 1,230\nNet (loss) (432) — (432)\nEnding balance December 31, 2022 $ 2,230 $ — $ 2,230\nDistributions — (2,294) (2,294)\nStock compensation 702 — 702\nForeign currency translation — 17 17\nRecapitalization — 9,866 9,866\nNet (loss) income (225) 14,891 14,666\nEnding balance December 31, 2023 $ 2,707 $ 22,480 $ 25,187\nNon-controlling Interest - BitAccess\nIn July 2021, the Company obtained a controlling interest in BitAccess Inc. in a business combination. The un-affiliated interest in BitAccess Inc. is reported as non-\ncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the non-controlling interest ownership was\n17.86% and 15.31%, respectively.\nThe non-controlling interest has certain rights as defined in the Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement, including the right, but not the obligation, to cause the\nCompany to purchase the non-controlling interest immediately prior to a liquidity event (as defined in the Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement) at the fair value of\nthe non-controlling interest as of the liquidity event. The non-controlling interest is not mandatorily redeemable. The Company also holds a right, but not an obligation, to\ncause the non-controlling interest holders to sell the non-controlling interest under the same conditions. The Merger was not considered to be a liquidity event as defined in the\nagreement.\nNon-controlling Interest - BT HoldCo\nThe Company is the primary beneficiary of BT HoldCo. The majority stockholder of BT HoldCo, BT Assets, holds 41,200,000 common units, and 2,900,000 preferred units\nof BT HoldCo, along with 44,100,000 Class V voting, non-economic shares in the Company. BT Assets has the right to exchange the common units, together with a\ncorresponding number of shares of Class V common stock, for, at the Company’s option, (i) shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or (ii) cash from a substantially\nconcurrent public offering or private sale (based on the price of the Company’s Class A common stock). The ownership interests in BT HoldCo held by BT Assets represent\nthe non-controlling interest not directly attributable to Bitcoin Depot and are reported as part of non-controlling interests in BT HoldCo on the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements. As of December 31, 2023, BT Assets has not exchanged any common units.\nThe preferred units are entitled to a $10.00 per unit preference (total preference of $29.0 million) on liquidation or distribution before any distributions may be made to other\nunitholders (other than certain permitted tax distributions).After the close of the Merger, up to\n107\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n$29.0 million of the net income from BT OpCo may be allocated to BT HoldCo. If net income exceeds $29.0 million, such excess income will be allocated to Bitcoin Depot\nand BT HoldCo based on their pro rata economic ownership interest in BT OpCo. When the preference amount is paid, the preferred units are automatically converted to\ncommon units. As such, the Company uses the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method to determine its equity in the earnings of BT HoldCo. Under the\nHLBV method, a calculation is prepared at each balance sheet date to determine the amount that the Company would receive if BT HoldCo were to liquidate all of its assets\n(at book value in accordance with U.S. GAAP) on that date and distribute the net proceeds to the partners based on the contractually-defined liquidation priorities. The\ndifference between the net assets at the beginning and end of the period, after adjusting for capital contributions, tax distributions, stock compensation and distributions, is the\nCompany’s income or loss from BT HoldCo for the period.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the non-controlling interest ownership of BT HoldCo was 72.6% and the non-controlling interests measured under the HLBV method were $25.2\nmillion.\nBT Assets also holds 15,000,000 BT Earnout units, which are discussed in more detail at Note 16.\n(12) Cryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrency transactions\nCryptocurrencies are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and are recognized at cost, net of impairment losses. Impairments are recorded whenever the fair value\nof the cryptocurrency decreases below its carrying value at any time during the period from acquisition. After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount\nof the cryptocurrency becomes its new accounting basis and this new adjusted cost basis will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value.\nThe carrying values of cryptocurrencies were the following at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nCryptocurrency 2023 2022\nBTC $ 711 $ 523\nETH 1 9\nLTC — 8\n$ 712 $ 540\nThe following tables present additional information about the adjusted cost basis of cryptocurrencies (in thousands):\nBTC ETH LTC Total\nBeginning balance—January 1, 2023 $ 523 $ 9 $ 8 $ 540\nPurchase or receipts of cryptocurrency 534,947 4 3 534,954\nCost of cryptocurrencies sold or distributed (527,036) (12) (11) (527,059)\nImpairment of cryptocurrencies (7,723) — — (7,723)\nBalance—December 31, 2023 $ 711 $ 1 $ — $ 712\nBTC ETH LTC Total\nBeginning balance—January 1, 2022 $ 563 $ 5,988 $ 6 $ 6,557\nPurchase or receipts of cryptocurrency 520,487 2,423 2,510 525,420\nCost of cryptocurrencies sold or distributed (513,750) (8,395) (2,471) (524,616)\nImpairment of cryptocurrencies (6,777) (7) (37) (6,821)\nBalance—December 31, 2022 $ 523 $ 9 $ 8 $ 540\nPurchases or receipts of cryptocurrency consists of: (a) cash paid by the Company to purchase cryptocurrencies on various exchanges and from liquidity providers and related\ntransaction costs to acquire the cryptocurrencies, (b) receipts of cryptocurrency sold to the Company by customers at the BTM kiosks, and (c) receipts of cryptocurrency by\nthe Company as consideration for company website and software services revenue.

As a result of the Merger, these Warrants became Bitcoin Depot Warrants.\nEach whole Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. A holder may exercise its warrants only for a\nwhole number of shares of Class A common stock. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The Company may\nredeem the Public Warrants at a price of $0.01 per share if the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading\ndays within a 30-trading day period. The Private Warrants cannot be redeemed, even if sold or transferred to a non-affiliate. The Warrants will expire five years after the\nClosing Date, June 30, 2028, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company also has the ability to redeem outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become\nexercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant, provided that the last reported sale price of Class A common stock for any 20 trading days\nwithin a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the Public Warrant holders equals or exceeds\n$18.00 per share and provided certain other conditions are met.\nThe Private Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Public Warrants, except the Private Warrants are not subject to redemption, and do not\nbecome subject to redemption after transfer to a non-affiliate (a distinction from other private placement warrants issued in connection with GSRM transactions).\nThe Warrants are accounted for as freestanding equity contracts and are classified in equity under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Warrants were recorded in connection with the reverse recapitalization accounting as part of the adjustment to accumulated deficit on the\nconsolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity and Member's Equity.\n(16) Earnouts\nIn connection with the Merger, the Sponsor received the Sponsor Earnout Shares, divided into three classes of Class E common stock; E-1, E-2, and E-3, respectively. All\nclasses of Class E common stock are held by a single party. Upon achieving certain milestones (described below), each share of Class E common stock is automatically\nconverted into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Class E common stock shares do not have any voting or economic rights, and\nthey represent the right to receive shares of Class A common stock.\n111\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn addition to the Sponsor Earnout Shares described above, BT HoldCo also issued earnouts (“BT HoldCo Earnout Units”), of which 1,075,061 were issued to the Company\nand 15,000,000 were issued to BT Assets, Inc.

BT HoldCo Earnout Units issued to BT Assets, Inc. will impact the non-controlling interest recognized\nby the Company when these units vest.\nThe Earnout Shares (both Sponsor Earnout Shares and BT HoldCo Earnout Units) vest as follows:\nFirst Earnout Period (seven years from date of Merger):\n(a) One-third (1/3rd) of the Earnout Shares (Class E-1 common stock), if the closing share price of Bitcoin Depot’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per\nshare (Class A common stock) equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 10 trading days within any consecutive 20 trading day period that occurs after the\nClosing Date; and\n(b) One-third (1/3rd) of the Earnout Shares (Class E-2 common stock), if the closing share price of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $14.00 per share for\nany 10 trading days within any consecutive 20 trading day period.\nSecond Earnout Period (ten years from date of Merger):\n(a) Remaining Earnout Shares (representing one-third (1/3rd)) (Class E-3 common stock) if the closing share price of Bitcoin Depot’s Class A common stock\nequals or exceeds $16.00 per share for any 10 trading days within any consecutive 20 trading day period that occurs after the Closing Date.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the market price of the Company's Class A common stock did not exceed required amount per share.

In the 2022, the effective tax rate\ndiffers from the statutory U.S. federal rate of 21.0% primarily due to the income or loss not being taxed due to the income and loss flowing through to its partners (non-\ncontrolling interest), and permanent differences.\n114\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the\namount used for income tax purposes.

Management of the Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its\ndeferred tax asset generated from its partnership interest in BT HoldCo. Management determined based on applicable accounting standards and the weight of all available\nevidence, it was not more-likely-than-not (“MLTN”) that the Company will realize its deferred tax asset for the difference in tax basis in excess of the GAAP basis for its\ninvestment in BT HoldCo, as the Company will not realize until its investment is liquidated or sold. Consequently, the Company has established a valuation allowance of $5.2\nmillion with respect to its deferred tax asset related to its investment in BT HoldCo. The Company’s change in valuation allowance from 2022 to 2023 was $5.2 million. The\nCompany evaluated that the remaining deferred tax assets of $2.4 million will be recoverable due to significant taxable income at Bitcoin Depot, Inc.\nThe total liability for unrecognized income tax benefits was approximately $0.8 million as of December 31, 2023, of which included less than $0.1 million of penalties and\ninterest. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties, if applicable, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company believes that it is\nreasonably possible a decrease of up to $0.8 million in unrecognized tax benefits, which will occur within the coming 12 months.\nIn accordance with the Company’s adoption of SAB 121, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability on the safeguarded asset and an offsetting deferred tax asset on the\nsafeguarded liability.

The Phantom Plan awards eligible participants\nperformance units entitling the holder to receive cash payments contingent upon certain qualifying events. The performance units vest according to the terms approved in the\nPhantom Plan, contingent upon the employee remaining continuously in service with the Company through the date of the qualifying event.

See 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan for additional details regarding the issuance.\nPerformance-based RSUs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has issued approximately 1 million performance-based RSUs, which are related to various Adjusted EBITDA\nTargets over the next three years. These targets are established by the Compensation Committee on the certification date which will be April 1, 2024, April 1, 2025 and April\n1, 2026. As a result, the grant date will be the certification date, and the Company has not recognized any compensation expense associated with the performance awards for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023.\nWeighted-average\nAmount of RSUs grant date fair value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 — $ —\nGranted 1,473,585 $ 3.59\nForfeited (52,500) $ 3.61\nDelivered (69,000) $ 3.61\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 1,352,085 $ 3.59\n(20) Net Income (loss) per Share\nThe Series A Preferred Stock have similar economic rights to the Class A common stock and management considers them to be in substance common shares for earnings per\nshare (“EPS”) purposes. As a result, the weighted average Series A Preferred Stock outstanding during the period was included in the calculation of weighted average\ncommon stock outstanding. No other classes of shares with economic rights were outstanding during the period, and therefore, EPS was not presented for such classes. The\nPublic and Private Warrants were considered in diluted EPS under the treasury stock method, if dilutive. The Class E common stock represents earnout arrangements that are\ncontingently issuable into Class A common stock, and are only considered in the calculation of EPS once the\n118\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nstock price milestones have been achieved. The non-controlling interest was considered in diluted EPS under the if-converted method, if dilutive.\nThe stock compensation expense related to Class A shares has been attributed entirely to Bitcoin Depot Inc. for purposes of the net income (loss) per share calculation within\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Additionally, for purposes of the net income (loss) per share calculation, because such\namounts pertain to compensation expense that do not affect the net assets of BT HoldCo available for liquidation, they are not further attributed to the non-controlling interest\nholders under the HLBV method described in Note 11.\nManagement determined that EPS for periods prior to the Merger, was not considered meaningful due to the complexities of determining the weighted average stock\noutstanding as a result of the recapitalization. Accordingly, the computation of loss per share and weighted average common stock outstanding has only been presented for the\nperiod from the date of transaction close through December 31, 2023, as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\n(from the date of the\nclose of the transaction)\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) attributable to Bitcoin Depot Inc.

Employees who are over the age of 21 years are eligible to participate\nin the plan. Eligible employees may elect to defer a percentage of eligible compensation, which is subject to an annual limit of the lesser of 90% of eligible compensation or\nthe maximum limit set by the IRS. The Company matches employee contributions up to a maximum of 50% of the participant’s compensation deferral, limited to 6% of the\nemployee’s compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company made contributions of $0.2 million and $0.2 million to the plan. These expenses are\nincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(22) Significant Vendor\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a significant vendor from which they purchased substantially all of their BTM kiosks, and from which the\nCompany licensed software which was embedded in the kiosks to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. As the Company migrated substantially all of its legacy BTM kiosks\nfrom this third-party vendor to its BitAccess software platform during 2022, the Company no longer considers this a significant vendor as of December 31, 2022. For the year\n119\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nended 2022, the Company purchased software services from this significant vendor of $2.3 million, which is included in cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and\namortization) in the consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n(23) Leases\nThe Company adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective transition approach. The Company has elected to adopt practical expedients\nwhich permits it to not reassess its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct cost under the new standard. The Company elected not to\nrecognize right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities for leases with terms of 12 months or less at lease commencement and do not include an option to purchase the\nunderlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, primarily by determining if the\narrangement conveys to the Company the right to control or use an identified asset. The Company makes this determination at inception of a contract and when the terms of\nan existing contract are changed. The Company recognizes a lease liability and an ROU asset at the commencement date of each lease. For operating and finance leases, the\nlease liability is initially measures at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is subsequently measured at\namortized cost using the effective-interest method. The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease\npayments made at or before lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Variable payments are included in the future\nlease payments when those variable payments are included in the future lease payment when those variable payments depend on an index or a rate. The discount rate is the\nimplicit rate, if it is readily determinable, or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would\nhave to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms and in a similar economic environment. The Company recognizes\nlease costs associated with short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When contracts contain lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for\nboth components as a single lease component.\nOn adoption, the Company recognized operating lease liabilities of $0.6 million with corresponding ROU assets of $0.4 million which is the net of operating lease liabilities\non adoption and deferred rent liability of $0.2 million at January 1, 2022. In connection with the adoption of ASC Topic 842, the Company reclassified existing capital lease\nobligations to finance lease obligations, which are presented as current installments of obligations under finance leases and obligation under leases, non-current on the\nconsolidated Balance Sheets. There was no impact on the Statement of Changes in Stockholder's Equity and Member’s Equity for the adoption of Topic 842.\nFloorspace leases\nThe Company has obligations as a lessee for floorspace. Generally, these leases arrangements meet the short-term lease criteria as the floorspace leases generally are\ncancellable by the Company with a 30 day or less notice, except for one arrangement. Accordingly, for the leases that are cancellable, the Company has applied the practical\nexpedient that allows the Company to recognize short-term lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term on the consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and\nComprehensive Income (Loss). For those floorspace leases that have a noncancellable terms greater than 12 months, we record operating lease right-of-use assets and\noperating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOffice space leases\nThe Company has obligations as a lessee for office space under a noncancellable lease arrangement that expires in May 2025, with options to renew up to five years.\nPayments due under the lease contracts include mainly fixed payments. The lease for the office space is classified as an operating lease in accordance with Topic 842.\nBTM Kiosk leases\nThe Company has obligations as a lessee for BTM kiosks. The leases for the BTM kiosks are classified as finance leases in accordance with Topic 842 that expire on various\ndates through June 30, 2026. The BTM kiosk lease agreements are for two or three year terms and include various options to either renew the lease, purchase the kiosks or\nexercise a bargain option to purchase the kiosk at the end of the term. Certain finance leases are personally guaranteed by the CEO and contain guarantees for return of\nequipment by the CEO.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company amended the various existing lease agreements with a lessor through various amendments. Under these\namendments, the Company extended the lease term and revised the purchase option to include a purchase requirement at the end of the lease term. Under the payment\nschedule, the Company will pay $1.9 million of the purchase price over 24 months beginning in January 2023 and will pay the remaining $7.0 million under the following\npayment schedule: (a) $1.9 million paid in April 2023; (b) $2.5 million paid in July 2023; (c) $1.3 million payable in October 2023; and (d) $1.3 million payable in January\n120\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2024. As a result of the modifications, the Company remeasured its finance lease assets and liabilities on the dates of the modifications. The remeasurement increased net\nbook value of the BTM kiosk by $8.9 million and increased the finance liability by $9.0 million at December 31, 2022. When the Company purchases the assets at the end of\nthe finance lease, these assets will be amortized over the remaining useful life.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company terminated three existing lease arrangement with a lessor and simultaneously entered into a new lease arrangement\nwith a new lessor for 2,050 BTMs. Under this agreement, the new lessor agreed to purchase the BTM’s from the original lessor. Upon the termination of the original\nagreement, the Company removed the remaining right-of-use asset and the finance lease liability of $7.5 million and $5.7 million respectively and recognized a loss of $1.7\nmillion recorded in other (expense) income in the consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The new leases commenced on March 31,\n2023, June 30, 2023 or September 30, 2023 and has a three year noncancellable period. Total fixed payments due on an undiscounted basis over the three year noncancellable\nperiod of the leases are $7.1 million. The Company will acquire the assets for a bargain purchase price of $1 at the end of the term. Due to the bargain purchase option, the\nCompany classified the new lease as a finance lease. The Company recognized a finance lease liability of $5.7 million discounted at an interest rate implicit in the lease and a\ncorresponding right-of-use asset of $5.7 million.\nIn December 2023, the Company entered into a finance agreement with a financing company to facilitate the purchase of 450 BTMs at the end of a lease with a lessor (Note\n14) for $1.3 million. The Company recorded the cash flow impact of this agreement gross within the investing and financing sections of the consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlow. The company transferred the remaining $1.8 million worth of unamortized cost basis of the kiosk machines- leased to kiosk machines- owned.\nThe Company also transferred certain BTMs recorded as finance leases held with the financing company to kiosk machines – owned of $3.0 million in remaining unamortized\ncost basis and finance lease liabilities to notes payable of $1.3 million during the year-ended December 31, 2023. In addition, approximately $1.7 million of other finance\nleases ended during the year with the kiosks assets transferred to the Company. The Company recognized approximately $6.5 million net, of non-cash investing and financing\nactivities associated with these agreements during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe components of the lease expense are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nFinance lease expense:\nAmortization of right-of-use-assets $ 8,492 $ 13,729\nInterest on lease liabilities 3,343 4,872\nTotal finance lease expense $ 11,835 $ 18,601\nOperating lease expense 293 220\nShort-term lease expense 34,526 39,765\nTotal lease expense $ 46,654 $ 58,586\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nOther information:\nOperating cash flows used for finance leases $ (3,343) $ (4,872)\nOperating cash flows used for operating leases $ (318) $ (222)\nFinancing cash flows used for finance leases $ (14,005) $ (17,106)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - finance leases 1.61 1.96\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases 2.32 2.25\nWeighted-average discount rate - finance leases\n17.9% 17.0%\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases % %\n16.6 15.0\n121\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMaturities of the lease liability under the non-cancellable operating lease as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nOperating Leases\n2024 $ 355\n2025 221\n2026 120\n2027 30\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 726\nLess: imputed interest (128)\nTotal operating lease liability $ 598\nLess: operating lease liabilities, current (279)\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion $ 319\nMaturities of the lease liability under the non-cancellable finance leases as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nFinance Leases\n2024 $ 7,910\n2025 2,518\n2026 675\nTotal undiscounted lease payments $ 11,103\nLess: imputed interest (1,454)\nTotal finance lease liability $ 9,649\nLess: current installments of obligations under finance leases (6,801)\nObligations under finance leases, excluding current installments $ 2,848\n(24) Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nFrom time to time in the regular course of its business, the Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters. Except as noted below,\nthere are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.\nThe Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably\nestimable. These contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.\nThe Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect\non its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.\nOn January 13, 2023, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (“Canaccord”) commenced proceedings against the Company by filing a claim with the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto,\nOntario which named Lux Vending, LLC and Bitcoin Depot LLC as the defendants. Canaccord is a financial services firm in Canada that the Company previously had hired\nto perform advisory services related to a potential initial public offering in Canada or sales transaction. The claim asserts that Lux Vending, LLC breached the contract by\nterminating the contract to avoid paying fees for their services and that Canaccord is entitled to $23.0 million in damages equivalent to the fees alleged to be payable for\nbreach of contract that would have been owed upon the closing of a transaction to acquire control, the sale of substantially all the Company’s assets, or a merger transaction\npursuant to the previously terminated engagement letter for advisory services. Canaccord proposes that the amount of fees would be calculated on the total cash transaction\nvalue of the business combination of $880.0 million. The claim also seeks an award for legal and other costs relating to the proceeding.\n122\nTable of Contents\nBITCOIN DEPOT INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBitcoin Depot does not believe the allegations made against it are valid and intends to vigorously defend against them. The range of potential loss related to the identified\nclaim is between $0 and $23.0 million, the amount of damages that Canaccord is seeking in the lawsuit. The additional costs mentioned in the claim are not able to be\nestimated at this time.\nFinancial and tax regulations\nLegislation or guidance may be issued by U.S. and non-U.S. governing bodies, including Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCen”) and the Internal Revenue\nService (“IRS”), that may differ significantly from the Company’s practices or interpretation of the law, which could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and\nresults of operations, and accordingly, the related impact on our financial condition and results of operations is not estimable. Prior to 2022, the IRS concluded an examination\nof the Company related to certain regulatory reporting requirements related to cryptocurrency sales to certain customers. Based on the outcome of the examination, the\nCompany has concluded it is not probable that any fines or penalties will be assessed against the Company. As a result, no accrual has been recorded in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements.\n(25) Subsequent Events\nOn March 26, 2024, the Company entered into a new amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. This amendment provides for an additional principal\namount of $15.7 million and specifies an exit fee equal to 8.5% of the additional principal amount, due and payable upon full repayment of the principal. This additional\nprincipal amount requires repayments of $0.6 million on June 15, 2025, $0.8 million on December 15, 2025, and $0.9 million on June 15, 2026, with all remaining amounts\ndue upon maturity on June 23, 2026. As part of the new amendment, the Company recognized expenses of $0.5 million upon funding of the additional principal.\nOn March 13, 2024, the Company entered into a binding term sheet with a third-party to acquire kiosks with a total value of approximately $4.6 million. The Company intends\nto establish lease arrangements with third-party lessors as the kiosks become available.

Based upon that evaluation,\nmanagement has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2023 as a result of the material weaknesses described below.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nIn connection with the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses in its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. The material weaknesses had not been remediated as of December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of\ndeficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not\nbe prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified related to (i) the fact that the Company did not have formalized system of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting in place to ensure that risks are properly assessed, controls are properly designed and implemented and internal controls are properly monitored\nand functioning, (ii) the Company’s reliance on IT systems and the use of service organizations to initiate, process, and record transactions, for which it did not evaluate or test\nthe respective control objectives and data provided by the service organizations, and did not maintain a sufficient complement of formally documented general IT controls over\naccess, segregation of duties, security, and change management, (iii) the Company’s lack of technical accounting resources to analyze and apply technical accounting\nconsiderations, (iv) the Company having insufficient controls in place to prevent potential unauthorized activity related to cryptocurrencies, and (v) ineffective reconciliation\ncontrols over cash in transit. Management has concluded that these material weaknesses arose because, the Company did not have the necessary business processes, personnel\nand related internal controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud, and material weaknesses could limit the ability to prevent or detect a\nmisstatement of accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements. To address the material weaknesses, the Company\nwill need to add personnel as well as implement additional financial reporting processes and related internal controls. Management intends to continue to take steps to remediate\nthe material weaknesses described above through hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel, further enhancing their accounting processes and risk\nassessment, and by designing, implementing and monitoring the respective controls.\n124\nTable of Contents\nManagement will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and the controls have been operating effectively for a sufficient\nperiod of time. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects or that\nthe actions that management may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial\nreporting or that they will prevent or detect potential future material weaknesses. The Company’s current controls and any new controls that management develops may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions in the business and weaknesses in disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm the operating results or cause the\nCompany to fail to meet the reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of the Company’s financial statements for prior periods.\nNotwithstanding the above identified material weaknesses, management believes the Consolidated Financial Statements as included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K fairly represent, in all material respects, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting until after the\nCompany is no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which the internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to\nimplement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent\nregistered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting required to be included in Bitcoin Depot’s\nperiodic reports that are filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose\nconfidence in Bitcoin Depot’s reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of the Class A common stock. In\naddition, we will not be able to continue to be listed on Nasdaq, which could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of your investment.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or\nis reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nTax Receivable Agreement\n135\nTable of Contents\nAt the Closing of the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with BT HoldCo and BT Assets. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are\ngenerally required to pay BT Assets 85% of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes that we realize, or in certain circumstances is\ndeemed to realize, as a result of certain Tax Attributes, including:\n• existing tax basis in certain assets of BT HoldCo and BT OpCo, including assets that will eventually be subject to depreciation or amortization, once placed\nin service, attributable to BT HoldCo Common Units acquired by us at the Closing and thereafter in accordance with the terms of the BT HoldCo Amended\nand Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement;\n• tax basis adjustments resulting from our acquisition of BT HoldCo Common Units from BT Assets at the Closing and thereafter pursuant to the terms of the\nBT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (including any such adjustments resulting from certain payments made by us\nunder the Tax Receivable Agreement);\n• disproportionate tax-related allocations as a result of Section 704(c) of the Code; and\n• tax deductions in respect of interest payments deemed to be made by us in connection with the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are our obligations and not obligations of BT HoldCo. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are generally\ntreated as realizing a tax benefit from the use of a Tax Attribute on a “with and without” basis, by comparing our actual tax liability to the amount we would have been required\nto pay had we not been able to utilize any of the Tax Attributes. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced upon the Closing and will continue until all Tax\nAttributes have been utilized or expired, unless an early termination event occurs and we are required to make the termination payment specified in the Tax Receivable\nAgreement (as described further below).\nThe amounts payable, as well as the timing of any payments, under the Tax Receivable Agreement are dependent upon significant future events, including (but not limited to)\nthe timing of the exchanges of BT HoldCo Common Units and surrender of a corresponding number of shares of Class V common stock, the price of Class A common stock at\nthe time of each exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable transactions, the depreciation and amortization periods that apply to any increase in tax basis resulting\nfrom such exchanges, the types of assets held by BT HoldCo and BT OpCo, the amount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rate\nthen applicable and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. In\nconnection with the preparation of the proxy statement filed in connection with the Business Combination, we previously estimated that the payment of the Over the Top\nConsideration (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) to BT Assets in the Business Combination would result in aggregate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement of\napproximately $1.7 million. This amount did not take into account any future exchanges of BT HoldCo Common Units by BT Assets pursuant to the BT HoldCo Amended and\nRestated Limited Liability Company Agreement and this assumed (i) there would be a certain number of redemptions in connection with the Business Combination, (ii) a\nconstant federal and state blended tax rate of 26.1% would apply to the Company, (iii) there would be no material changes in tax law and (iv) we have sufficient taxable income\nto utilize all Tax Attributes. These amounts are estimates and were prepared for informational purposes only. The actual amount of payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement could vary significantly.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine (with the amount of subject payments determined in\nconsultation with an advisory firm and subject to BT Assets’ review and consent). The IRS or another taxing authority may challenge all or any part of a position taken with\nrespect to Tax Attributes or the utilization thereof, as well as other tax positions that we take, and a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event that any Tax Attributes\ninitially claimed or utilized by us are disallowed, BT Assets will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made pursuant to the\nTax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, any excess payments made to BT Assets will be applied\nagainst and reduce any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement after the determination of such excess. However, a\nchallenge to any Tax Attributes initially claimed or utilized may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. Moreover, even if a challenge arises\nearlier, any excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we are otherwise required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable\nAgreement. As a result, there might not be future cash payments against which any excess can be applied and we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement in excess of our actual savings in respect of the Tax Attributes, which could materially impair our financial condition.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in the case of certain early termination events (including certain changes of control, material breaches, or at our option subject to\nthe approval of a majority of our independent directors), we will be required to make a\n136\nTable of Contents\nlump-sum cash payment to BT Assets equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement,\nwhich lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to us having sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize the Tax Attributes over\ncertain specified time periods and that all BT HoldCo Common Units that had not yet been exchanged for shares of Class A common stock, shares of Class M common stock or\ncash are deemed exchanged.\nAccordingly, as a result of these assumptions, the lump-sum payment may be due significantly in advance, and could materially exceed, the actual future tax benefits we realize.\nIn these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a material and adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition, and could have the\neffect of delaying, deferring, or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. For example, in connection with the\npreparation of the proxy statement filed in connection with the Business Combination, we previously estimated that if we had experienced a change of control or the Tax\nReceivable Agreement had otherwise been terminated immediately after the Closing, the estimated lump-sum payment would have been approximately $90.2 million. This\nestimated lump-sum payment was based on certain assumptions and was calculated using a discount rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 100 basis points,\napplied against an undiscounted liability of approximately $134.6 million (based on the 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and an estimated state and local income tax\nrate). These amounts are estimates and have been prepared for informational purposes only. The actual amount of such lump-sum payment could vary significantly.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to provide BT Assets with a schedule showing the calculation of payments that are due under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement with respect to each applicable taxable year. This calculation will be based upon the advice of an advisory firm. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement\ngenerally will be required to be made to BT Assets a short period of time after an applicable schedule becomes final pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Tax Receivable\nAgreement. Interest on such payments will begin to accrue on the due date (without extensions) of our U.S. federal income tax return for the applicable taxable year. Any late\npayments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue to accrue interest (generally at a default rate) until such payments are made. Our failure to make\nany payment required under the Tax Receivable Agreement within three months of the date on which the payment is required to be made will constitute a material breach under\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement, which will terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate future payments thereunder (as described above), unless making such\npayment would cause us to become insolvent or the failure to make the applicable payment is attributable to us (i) being prohibited from making such payment under the terms\ngoverning certain portions of our indebtedness and (ii) not having, and being unable to obtain with commercially reasonable efforts, sufficient funds to make such payment.\nWe are required to notify and keep BT Assets reasonably informed regarding tax audits or other proceedings the outcome of which is reasonably expected to materially and\nadversely affect payments to BT Assets under the\nTax Receivable Agreement, and BT Assets has the right to (i) discuss with us, and provide input and comment to us regarding, any portion of any such tax audit or proceeding\nand (ii) participate in, at BT Assets’ expense, any such portion of any such tax audit or proceeding to the extent it relates to issues the resolution of which would reasonably be\nexpected to affect payments to BT Assets under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We are not permitted to settle or fail to contest any issue pertaining to income taxes that is\nreasonably expected to adversely affect BT Assets’ rights and obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement without the consent of BT Assets (such consent not to be\nunreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).\nThe foregoing description of the Tax Receivable Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Tax Receivable Agreement, a copy of which has been filed as an\nexhibit to the Registration Statement and is also filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nBT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement\nWe operate our business through BT OpCo, a wholly owned subsidiary of BT HoldCo, and BT OpCo’s subsidiaries. At the Closing, we entered into the BT HoldCo Amended\nand Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement with BT HoldCo and BT Assets, which set forth, among other things, the rights and obligations of the members and the\nmanager of BT HoldCo.\nManagement\nPursuant to the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, the business, property and affairs of BT HoldCo are managed by Brandon Mintz, as\nthe manager of BT HoldCo, whose actions as manager are subject to our sole, absolute and exclusive direction.\nCapitalization; Earnout Units\n137\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the BT Entity Restructuring and the Transaction Agreement, BT HoldCo now has three authorized classes of units: BT HoldCo Preferred Units, BT HoldCo\nCommon Units and BT HoldCo Earnout Units, with the BT HoldCo Earnout Units further divided into three subclasses, being (i) Class 1 Earnout Units of BT HoldCo, (ii) Class\n2 Earnout Units of BT HoldCo and (iii) Class 3 Earnout Units of BT HoldCo.\nIn connection with the Closing of the Business Combination and subject to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, BT HoldCo issued BT HoldCo Common\nUnits and the BT HoldCo Matching Warrants to us in exchange for a cash contribution to BT HoldCo. The BT HoldCo Matching Warrants issued to us are exercisable to\npurchase a number of BT HoldCo Common Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock that may be purchased upon the exercise in full of all Warrants\noutstanding immediately after the Closing, such that immediately after completion of the Business Combination and the issuance of BT HoldCo Common Units and BT HoldCo\nMatching Warrants by BT HoldCo to us, the total number of BT HoldCo Common Units held by us will equal the total number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock\nand the total number of BT HoldCo Common Units into which the BT HoldCo Matching Warrants held by us are exercisable are equal to the total number of shares of Class A\ncommon stock for which outstanding warrants issued by us are exercisable. Upon the valid exercise of a BT HoldCo Matching Warrant by us in accordance with the Warrant\nAgreement, BT HoldCo will issue to us the number of BT HoldCo Common Units to be issued in connection with such exercise. If any holder of a Warrant exercises such\nwarrant, then we will cause a corresponding exercise of a BT HoldCo Matching Warrants, such that the number of shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with\nthe exercise of the Warrants will equal the number of BT HoldCo Common Units issued by BT HoldCo. The exercise price to exercise a BT HoldCo Matching Warrant will be\nequal to the exercise price paid by the holder of the corresponding Warrants. We further agreed that we will not exercise any BT HoldCo Matching Warrants other than in\nconnection with the corresponding exercise of a Warrant.\nAdditionally, in connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, BT Assets sold, transferred and assigned to us, and we purchased and accepted from BT Assets,\ncertain BT HoldCo Common Units in consideration for the Over the Top Consideration (as defined in the Transaction Agreement).\nIn connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, BT HoldCo issued BT HoldCo Earnout Units to BT Assets and to us that are accompanied by certain conversion\nrequirements and rights, including that the BT HoldCo Earnout Units may either be converted into BT HoldCo Common Units or forfeited based on achievement milestones for\nthe per-share price of Class A common stock during applicable earnout periods. Additionally, BT HoldCo Earnout Units may be automatically converted into BT HoldCo\nCommon Units upon the consummation of a change of control transaction that meets a certain per-share price of Class A common stock.\nPreferred Units\nBT Assets holds 2,900,000 BT HoldCo Preferred Units. The BT HoldCo Preferred Units are non-voting units of BT HoldCo that are senior to the BT HoldCo Common Units in\nrespect of distributions (as further described below). Each BT HoldCo Preferred Unit will automatically convert into one BT HoldCo Common Unit upon the distribution of\n$10.00 in respect of each such BT HoldCo Preferred Unit (or $29.0 million in the aggregate). The conversion of the BT HoldCo Common Units will occur automatically upon\nsuch event without any further action by BT HoldCo, the manager of BT HoldCo, BT Assets or any other person. Following the conversion of the BT HoldCo Preferred Units,\nsuch units will entitle the holder to the rights and obligations of a holder of a BT HoldCo Common Unit and each converted BT HoldCo Preferred Unit will cease to be issued or\noutstanding.\nAdditional Units; Repurchase or Redemption of Class A common stock\nThe manager of BT HoldCo has the right to cause BT HoldCo to issue and create additional equity securities of BT HoldCo.\nSubject to certain exceptions, at any time that we issue shares of Class A common stock, we will contribute to BT HoldCo all of the net proceeds (if any) we receive with respect\nto such shares of Class A common stock. Upon the contribution by us to BT HoldCo of all of such net proceeds we receive, BT HoldCo will issue a number of BT HoldCo\nCommon Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock so issued.\nIf, at any time, any shares of Class A common stock are repurchased or redeemed (whether by exercise of a put or call, automatically or by means of another arrangement) by us\nfor cash, except where such repurchase or redemption is paired with a stock split or stock dividend such that after the split or dividend there is an equal number of shares of\nClass A common stock outstanding as prior to the split or dividend, then the manager of BT HoldCo will cause BT HoldCo to, immediately prior to such repurchase or\nredemption of such shares, redeem a corresponding number of BT HoldCo Common Units held by us at an aggregate redemption price equal to the aggregate purchase or\nredemption price per share of Class A common stock being repurchased or redeemed by us (plus any reasonable expenses related thereto) and upon such other terms as are the\nsame for the share or shares of Class A common stock being repurchased or redeemed by us.\nDistributions\n138\nTable of Contents\nThe BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Agreement requires tax distributions be made by BT HoldCo to the BT HoldCo unitholders (including us), on a pro\nrata basis, to the extent funds of BT HoldCo are legally available for distribution and such distribution would not be prohibited under any credit facility or any other agreement\nto which BT HoldCo or any of its subsidiaries is a party, in each case, as determined by the manager of BT HoldCo in its reasonable discretion. Tax distributions shall be made\non a quarterly basis to each unitholder based on such unitholder’s allocable share of the taxable income of BT HoldCo and an assumed tax rate (and, in our case, taking into\naccount our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement). The assumed tax rate will be the highest combined federal, state, and local tax rate that may potentially apply to\na corporate or individual taxpayer (whichever is higher), taking into account certain assumptions and without regard to the actual final tax liability of any unitholder.\nOther than with respect to tax distributions and subject to distributions to reimburse the manager of BT HoldCo and us for reasonable expenses, the manager may cause BT\nHoldCo to make distributions at such time, in such amounts and in such form (including in kind property) as determined by the manager, in each case, to the holders of BT\nHoldCo Preferred Units and Common Units in the following order of priority: (1) first, to the holders of the BT HoldCo Preferred Units until each such unit has received $10.00\nin distributions (or $29.0 million in the aggregate) and (2) to the holders of the BT HoldCo Preferred Units and Common Units, pro rata based on the relative ownership of such\nunits.\nWe expect BT HoldCo may make distributions out of distributable cash periodically and as necessary to enable us to cover our operating expenses and other obligations,\nincluding tax liabilities and other obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, except to the extent such distributions would be prohibited under the BT HoldCo Amended\nand Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement or are otherwise prohibited by law.\nLiability; Indemnification; Manager Reimbursement\nThe BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement limits the liability of the members and unitholders of BT HoldCo and the officers, directors and\nmanagers of our, BT HoldCo and each of our subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and provides that BT HoldCo provide such persons with customary\nindemnification and advancement of expenses. BT HoldCo will reimburse the manager for any expenses incurred on behalf of BT HoldCo.\nThe manager will not be compensated for its services as the manager of BT HoldCo, but the manager will be reimbursed by BT HoldCo for any reasonable out-of-pocket\nexpenses incurred by it on behalf of BT HoldCo.\nRequested Services\nPursuant to the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, for so long as BT Assets holds at least 5% or more of the outstanding BT HoldCo\nCommon Units, BT HoldCo will use its reasonable best efforts to provide (or cause to be provided) at BT HoldCo expense, any accounting, tax, legal, insurance and\nadministrative support to BT Assets and its affiliates as BT Assets may reasonably request.\nThe foregoing description of the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the BT HoldCo\nAmended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, a copy of which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and is also filed as an exhibit to this\nannual report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nAmended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement\nAt the Closing, we amended and restated the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of February 24, 2022, as may be amended, by and among GSRM, Sponsor and the other\nholders party thereto. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, we granted certain customary registration rights with respect to our securities.\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, within 45 days of the Closing Date, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the\nSEC (at our sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of certain securities held by or issuable to the parties to the Amended and Restated Registration\nRights Agreement. In certain circumstances, certain parties to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement can demand our assistance with underwritten offerings\nand block trades, and certain parties to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement are entitled to piggyback registration rights.\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, shares held directly or indirectly by Sponsor, or distributed by Sponsor to certain third parties and\naffiliates of Sponsor concurrently with Closing, and BT Assets are subject to the Lock-Up Period, with 25% of such Lock-Up Shares being released at each quarterly earnings\nrelease that occurs at least 60 days after the Closing Date, subject to an early release if approved by a majority of the independent members of our board of directors.\n139\nTable of Contents\nThe foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amended and Restated Registration\nRights Agreement, a copy of which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and is also filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K and incorporated\nby reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nPreferred Sale Registration Rights Agreement\nOn October 3, 2023, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Preferred Sale RRA”) in connection with the Preferred Sale (as defined in the Preferred Sale\nRRA) with the Holders (as defined in the Preferred Sale RRA). The Preferred Sale RRA, among other things, provides that the Company is obligated to, within 15 calendar\ndays of the consummation of the Preferred Sale, file with the SEC a registration statement to register the resale of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion\nof the Series A Preferred subscribed for and purchased by the Holders.\nThe foregoing description of the Preferred Sale RRA does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Preferred Sale RRA, a copy of which\nhas been filed as an exhibit to the 8-K filed on October 4, 2023, which has been incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, we entered into separate indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers, in addition to the\nindemnification provided for in our organizational documents. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers for certain\ncosts, charges and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts, reasonably incurred by a director or executive officer in any action or\nproceeding because of their association with us or any of our subsidiaries.\nThe foregoing description of the Indemnification Agreements is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Indemnification Agreements, a copy of each of which has been\nfiled as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and is also filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-\nK.\nPolicies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions\nEffective upon the Closing, our board of directors adopted a written related person transaction policy that sets forth the following policies and procedures for the review and\napproval or ratification of related person transactions.\nA “related person transaction” is a transaction, arrangement or relationship in which we or any of our subsidiaries was, is or will be a participant, the amount of which involved\nexceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

Specifically, pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit\nCommittee will have the responsibility to review, approve and ratify related party transactions.\nThe Audit Committee shall be provided with the details of each new, existing, or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual\nrestrictions that the company has already committed to, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits of the transaction to the company and to the relevant related\nparty. Any member of the committee who has an interest in the related party transaction under review by the committee shall abstain from voting on the approval of the related\n140\nTable of Contents\nparty transaction, but may, if so requested by the chairman of the committee, participate in some or all of the committee’s discussions of the related party transaction.

There are currently [ ] shares of Class A common stock underlying the outstanding Warrants, which were held\nof record by 22 holders. There are no shares of Class B common stock, Class M common stock or Class O common stock outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nVoting\nExcept as otherwise required by the DGCL or as provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the Amended and Restated Charter:\n• Each holder of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Class A common stock held of record by such holder.\n• Each holder of Class B common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Class B common stock held of record by such holder.\n• Each holder of Class E common stock has no voting rights with respect to each share of Class E common stock held of record by such holder.\n• Each holder of Class M common stock is entitled to ten votes for each share of Class M common stock held of record by such holder.\n• Each holder of Class O common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Class O common stock held of record by such holder.\n• Each holder of Class V common stock is entitled to ten votes for each share of Class V common stock held of record by such holder.\nThe Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class M common stock, Class O common stock and Class V common stock are collectively referred to as the\n“Voting common stock.”\nExcept as otherwise required by the Amended and Restated Charter, holders of Voting common stock vote together as a single class on all matters on which\nstockholders are generally entitled to vote. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Charter, the holders of the outstanding shares of Voting common stock are entitled to vote\nseparately as a class upon any amendment to the Amended and Restated Charter (including by merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar event or otherwise) that would\nalter or change the powers, preferences, or special rights of a class of stock so as to affect them adversely.\nDividends\nSubject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock or any class or series of stock having a preference over or the\nright to participate with the Class A common stock and Class M common stock with respect to our payment of dividends in cash, stock, or property, such dividends may be\ndeclared and paid on the Class A common stock and Class M common stock out of our assets at such times and in such amounts as our board of directors shall determine in its\nsole discretion.\nPursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation, holders of Series A Preferred Stock participate fully with respect to all distributions and dividends made to the\nholders of the Class A common stock as if such shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted to shares of Class A common stock in accordance with the terms of the\nCertificate of Designation immediately prior to the applicable record date for such Class A common stock dividend or distribution.\nDividends shall not be declared or paid on shares of Class B common stock, Class E common stock, Class O common stock or Class V common stock.\nLiquidation or Dissolution\nUpon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, after payment or provision for payment of our debts and other liabilities as required by law and of the\npreferential and other amounts, if any, to which the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled, the holders of all outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class M\ncommon stock will be entitled to receive our remaining assets available for distribution ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by each such stockholder. The holders\nof shares of Class B common stock, Class E common stock, Class O common stock and/or shares of Class V common stock, as such, shall not be entitled to receive any of our\nassets in the event of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up its affairs.\nRedemption Rights\nAt all times we reserve and keep available out of our authorized and unissued shares of Class A common stock and Class M common stock, for the purposes of effecting\nany redemptions or exchanges pursuant to the applicable provisions of Article IX of the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, the number\nof shares of Class A common stock and Class M common stock that are issuable in connection with the Redemption or Direct Exchange (each as defined in the BT HoldCo\nAmended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement) of all outstanding BT HoldCo Common Units as a result of any Redemption or Direct Exchange pursuant to the\napplicable provisions of Article IX of the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, as applicable. In the event that (i) a share of Class A\ncommon stock and Class M common stock is issued as a result of any Redemption or Direct Exchange of any BT HoldCo Common Unit pursuant to the applicable provisions\nof Article IX of the BT HoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement or (ii) a Redemption by Cash Payment (as defined in the BT HoldCo Amended\nand Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement) is effected with respect to any BT HoldCo Common Units pursuant to the applicable provisions of Article IX of the BT\nHoldCo Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, or (iii) all of the outstanding shares of Class V common stock are converted to Class O common stock,\na share of Class O common stock or Class V common stock held by such unitholder chosen by us in our sole discretion will automatically and without further action on our part\nor the holder thereof be transferred to us for no additional consideration and thereupon shall automatically be retired and cease to exist, and such share thereafter may not be\nreissued by us.\nOther Provisions\nNo holder of Common Stock has any preemptive or other similar subscription rights.\nShares of Class V common stock may only be issued by us to BT Assets and its affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Redemption or Direct\nExchange involving an exchange of Class V common stock for Class M common stock may, at the option of the applicable member of BT HoldCo, be an exchange of Class V\ncommon stock for Class A common stock.\n- 2 -\nPreferred Stock\nWe are authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. Our board of directors is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by law, to provide for the\nissuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, and with respect to each series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the\nvoting powers (if any), designations, powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, of the shares of each such series, and any\nqualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The powers (including voting powers), preferences, and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of each series of\nPreferred Stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from those of any other series at any time outstanding. Subject to the rights of the\nholders of any series of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Preferred\nStock then outstanding) by the approval of our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of our capital\nstock entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, without the separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock as a class, irrespective of the provisions of Section\n242(b)(2) of the DGCL.\nIn connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, we filed a certificate of designation (the “Certificate of Designation”)\nwith the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware establishing the Series A Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the PIPE Agreement. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock (i)\nranks senior to the Common Stock with respect to dividends, distributions, redemptions and payments upon liquidation or dissolution, (ii) is entitled to participate in any\ndistributions or dividends made to holders of Class A common stock, (iii) does not have voting rights (other than in relation to amendments to the certificate of designation itself\nor as required by the DGCL), (iv) is initially convertible at any time at the election of the holder into one share of Class A common stock, subject to accrued and unpaid\ndividends, if any, and (v) is entitled to customary anti-dilution protections.\nWarrants\nThere are [ ] Warrants currently issued and outstanding, including [ ] Public Warrants and [ ] Private Placement Warrants.\nPublic Warrants\nEach Public Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one whole share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as\ndiscussed below, at any time commencing on July 30, 2023, 30 days after the completion of the business combination contemplated by the Transaction Agreement (the\n“Business Combination”), except as described below. The Public Warrants will expire on June 30, 2028, five years after the completion of the Business Combination, at 5:00\np.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. We are not obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a Public\nWarrant and have no obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A common\nstock underlying the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to\nregistration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of a Public Warrant unless the issuance\nof Class A common stock issuable upon such Public Warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence\nof the registered holder of the Public Warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a Public Warrant, the\nholder of such Public Warrant will not be entitled to exercise such Public Warrant and such Public Warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will we be\nrequired to net cash settle any Public Warrant.\nWe agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of the Business Combination, we would use our commercially\nreasonable efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to our IPO registration statement or a new registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act,\nof the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants, and we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become\neffective within 60 business days after the closing of the Business Combination, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus\n- 3 -\nrelating to those shares of Class A common stock until the Public Warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the Warrant Agreement. If a registration statement covering\nthe shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of the Business Combination, Public Warrant\nholders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement,\nexercise Public Warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption, but we will use our commercially reasonably\nefforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by\nsurrendering the Public Warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of the number of shares of Class\nA common stock underlying the Public Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” (defined below) less the exercise price of the Public Warrants by (ii) the\nfair market value. The “fair market value” as used in this paragraph shall mean the volume weighted average price of the shares of Class A common stock for the 10 trading\ndays ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent.\nNotwithstanding the above, if our Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a Public Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it\nsatisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their Public\nWarrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect\na registration statement, but we will be required to use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.\nIn such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the Public Warrants in exchange for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the\nquotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the Public Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value\n(as defined below) over the exercise price of the Public Warrants by (ii) the fair market value.\nRedemption of Public Warrants.\nOnce the Public Warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:\n• in whole and not in part;\n• at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;\n• upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each Public Warrant holder; and\n• if, and only if, the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable\nupon exercise or the exercise price of a Public Warrant as described under the heading “—Warrants—Public Warrants—Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20\ntrading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before we send the notice of redemption to the Public Warrant holders.\nWe will not redeem the Public Warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Class A\ncommon stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock is available throughout\nthe 30-day redemption period. If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the\nunderlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nWe have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the\nPublic Warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the Public Warrants, each Public Warrant holder will be entitled to\nexercise his, her or its Public Warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the shares of Class A common stock may fall below the $18.00 redemption\ntrigger price (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a Public Warrant as described under the heading “—Warrants—\nPublic Warrants—Anti-dilution Adjustments”) as well as the $11.50 (for whole shares) Public Warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.\n- 4 -\nIf we call the Public Warrants for redemption as described above, we will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its Public Warrant to do so on a\n“cashless basis.” In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a “cashless basis,” we will consider, among other factors, our cash position,\nthe number of Public Warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class A common stock issuable\nupon the exercise of our Public Warrants. If we take advantage of this option, all holders of Public Warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their Public Warrants\nfor that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the\nPublic Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the Public Warrants and the “fair market value”(defined below) by (ii) the fair market value. The\n“fair market value” means the 10-day average closing price as of the third day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the Public Warrants. If\nwe take advantage of this option, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares of Class A common stock to be received\nupon exercise of the Public Warrants, including the “fair market value” in such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued\nand thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a Public Warrant redemption. We believe this feature is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the\nPublic Warrants after the Business Combination. If we call our Public Warrants for redemption and we do not take advantage of this option, the holders of the Private Placement\nWarrants would still be entitled to exercise their Private Placement Warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other Public Warrant\nholders would have been required to use had all Public Warrant holders been required to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis, as described in more detail below.\nNo fractional shares of Class A common stock will be issued upon exercise. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we\nwill round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued to the holder.\nRedemption Procedures. A holder of a Public Warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the\nright to exercise such Public Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s actual\nknowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately after\ngiving effect to such exercise.\nAnti-dilution Adjustments. If the number of issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Class A\ncommon stock, or by a split-up of shares of Class A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the\nnumber of shares of Class A common stock issuable on exercise of each Public Warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the issued and outstanding shares of\nClass A common stock. A rights offering to holders of Class A common stock entitling holders to purchase shares of Class A common stock at a price less than the fair market\nvalue will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock actually sold\nin such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Class A common stock) multiplied by\n(ii) one minus the quotient of (x) the price per share of Class A common stock paid in such rights offering divided by (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (i) if the\nrights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Class A common stock, in determining the price payable for Class A common stock, there will be taken into\naccount any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted\naverage price of Class A common stock as reported during the ten trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of Class A common\nstock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.\nIn addition, if we, at any time while the Public Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the\nholders of Class A common stock on account of such shares of Class A common stock (or other shares of our capital stock into which the Public Warrants are convertible),\nother than (i) as described above, (ii) any cash dividends or cash distributions which, when combined on a per share basis with all other cash dividends and cash distributions\npaid on the Class A common stock during the 365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution do not exceed $0.50 (as adjusted for stock splits,\nstock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) but only\n- 5 -\nwith respect to the amount of the aggregate cash dividends or cash distributions equal to or less than $0.50 per share, or (iii) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of\nClass A common stock in connection with a proposed business combination, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair\nmarket value of any securities or other assets paid on each share of Class A common stock in respect of such event.\nIf the number of issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of\nshares of Class A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the\nnumber of shares of Class A common stock issuable on exercise of each Public Warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in issued and outstanding shares of\nClass A common stock.\nWhenever the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Public Warrants is adjusted, as described above, the Public Warrant\nexercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the Public Warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (i) the numerator of which will be the\nnumber of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Public Warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (ii) the denominator of which will\nbe the number of shares of Class A common stock so purchasable immediately thereafter.\nIn case of any reclassification or reorganization of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock (other than those described above or that solely affects\nthe par value of such shares of Class A common stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another entity in which any “person” or “group” (as such\nterms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) acquires more than 50% of the voting power of our securities, or in the case of any sale or conveyance to\nanother corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety, the holders of the Public Warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, on the\nbasis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Public Warrants and in lieu of our shares of Class A common stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable\nupon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares, stock or other equity securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such\nreclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the Public Warrants would have received if\nsuch holder had exercised their Public Warrants immediately prior to such event.\nThe Public Warrants were issued in registered, book entry form under the Warrant Agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent,\nand us. The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Public Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any\ndefective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then issued and outstanding Public Warrants to make any change that adversely affects the\ninterests of the registered holders of Public Warrants.\nThe Public Warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Common Stock and any voting rights until they exercise their Public Warrants and receive\nshares of Class A common stock. After the issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of the Public Warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each\nshare held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.\nWe have agreed that, subject to applicable law, any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the Warrant Agreement will be\nbrought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and we irrevocably submit to such\njurisdiction, which jurisdiction will be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. This provision does not apply to claims under the Exchange Act or any\nclaim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum but will apply to claims under the Securities Act.\nPrivate Placement Warrants\nIn connection with the closing of its IPO, GSRM completed the private sale of 12,223,750 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private\nPlacement Warrant, to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to GSRM of $12.2 million. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants sold as part of the\nunits in the IPO except that, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees: (i) they are not\n- 6 -\nredeemable by us; (ii) they (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) may not, subject to certain limited\nexceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the Sponsor until July 30, 2023, 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination; (iii) they may be exercised by the\nholders on a cashless basis; and (iv) they (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) are entitled to registration\nrights.\nIf holders of the Private Placement Warrants elect to exercise their Private Placement Warrants on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering\ntheir Private Placement Warrants in exchange for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of the number of\nshares of Class A common stock underlying the Private Placement Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” (defined below) over the exercise price of the\nPrivate Placement Warrants by (ii) the fair market value. The “fair market value” shall mean the average reported last reported sale price of the Class A common stock for the 10\ntrading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of Private Placement Warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent.\nChoice of Forum\nThe Amended and Restated Charter provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the\nCourt of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a\nclaim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the DGCL, the Amended and Restated Charter or Amended and Restated Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction\nover the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. The Amended and Restated Charter further provides that the federal district courts of the United States will be the\nexclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a\nprovision relating to causes of action arising under the Securities Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations\nthereunder. The clauses described above will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts\nhave exclusive jurisdiction.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of the Amended and Restated Charter and Amended and Restated Bylaws\nThe provisions of the Amended and Restated Charter and Amended and Restated Bylaws and of the DGCL summarized below may have an anti-takeover effect and\nmay delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that you might consider in your best interest, including an attempt that might result in your receipt of a premium\nover the market price for your shares of Class A common stock.\nThe Amended and Restated Charter and the Amended and Restated Bylaws contain certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and\nstability in the composition of our board of directors and that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a future takeover or change in control unless such\ntakeover or change in control is approved by our board of directors.\nThese provisions include:\n• Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders. The Amended and Restated Charter provides that, following the Trigger Date (as defined in the\nAmended and Restated Charter), stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by written consent in\nlieu of a meeting, unless such action has previously been approved and recommended by our board of directors. The Amended and Restated Charter and the\nAmended and Restated Bylaws also provide that, subject to any special rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock and except as otherwise required\nby law, special meetings of our stockholders may be called only (i) by or at the direction of (a) our board of directors pursuant to a written resolution adopted by\nthe affirmative vote of the majority of the total number of directors our board of directors would have if there were no vacancies,\n- 7 -\n(b) the Chairman of our board of directors, or (c) the Chief Executive Officer (if any) or (ii) prior to the date on which BT Assets and its affiliates cease to\nbeneficially own shares of Class M common stock and Class V common stock that in the aggregate represent at least 20% of the voting power represented by\nthe shares of Class V common stock held by BT Assets and its affiliates as of immediately after the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction\nAgreement, by the Chairman of our board of directors at the written request of the holders of Class V common stock.\n• Advance Notice Procedures. The Amended and Restated Bylaws established an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an\nannual meeting of our stockholders, and for stockholder nominations of persons for election to the board of directors to be brought before an annual or special\nmeeting of stockholders. Stockholders at an annual meeting are to be only able to consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or\nbrought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the record date for the\nmeeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given our secretary timely written notice, in proper form, of the stockholder’s intention to bring that\nbusiness or nomination before the meeting. Although the Amended and Restated Bylaws do not give the board of directors the power to approve or disapprove\nstockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting, as applicable, the Amended and\nRestated Bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or\ndeter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\n• Authorized but Unissued Shares. Our authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock and Preferred Stock are available for future issuance without\nstockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital,\ncorporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock and Preferred Stock could render\nmore difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of Class A common stock by means of a registration contest, tender offer, merger or\notherwise.\n• Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders. The Amended and Restated Charter provides that we are expressly not subject to Section 203 of the\nDGCL, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination, such as a\nmerger, with an “interested stockholder” (which includes a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years\nfollowing the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person\nbecame an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203. Nevertheless,\nthe Amended and Restated Charter contains provisions that, once we are no longer a “controlled company,” will have a similar effect to Section 203, except that\nthey provide that Sponsor, the holders of Class V common stock, and their respective affiliates or any other person with whom any of the foregoing are acting\nas a group or in concert for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock, or any person who would\notherwise be an interested stockholder either in connection with or because of a transfer, sale, assignment, conveyance, hypothecation, encumbrance, or other\ndisposition of five percent or more of the outstanding Voting Stock (in one transaction or a series of transactions) by any holders of Class V common stock or\nany of their respective affiliates or associates to such person, will not be deemed to be “interested stockholders,” and accordingly will not be subject to such\nrestrictions.\nLimitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nThe Amended and Restated Charter limits the liability of the directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as it now exists or may in the future be\namended and provides that we will provide them with customary indemnification and advancement of expenses. In addition, our Amended and Restated Charter provides that\nour directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or our stockholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of\nloyalty to us or our stockholders, acted in bad\n- 8 -\nfaith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper\npersonal benefit from their actions as directors.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions,\nregardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We have purchased a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our officers and\ndirectors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.\nThese provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect\nof reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nFurthermore, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to\nthese indemnification provisions.\nWe believe that these provisions, the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and\nexperienced officers and directors.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing\nprovisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\nIndemnification Agreements\nOn the Closing Date, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, we entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and\nexecutive officers. These indemnification agreements require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers for certain expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments,\nfines and settlement amounts incurred by a director or executive officer in any action or proceeding arising out of their service as one of our directors or executive officers.\nCorporate Opportunity\nOur Amended and Restated Charter provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, certain “exempted persons” do not have any fiduciary duty to refrain\nfrom engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or any of our affiliates, and no such persons will have any liability to us\nor our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of any such activities.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) we, on our behalf and on behalf of our affiliates, will renounce any interest or expectancy in a transaction or matter that may\nbe a corporate opportunity for us and (ii) the exempted persons will have no duty to present any such corporate opportunity to us and will not be liable to us, our affiliates or our\nstockholders for refraining to present any such corporate opportunity to us (other than in such person’s capacity as our director or officer). Notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in the Amended and Restated Charter, we do not renounce any interest or expectancy we may have in any business opportunity that is expressly offered to any\nExempted Person (as defined in the Amended and Restated Charter) in his or her capacity as our director or officer.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent for the Common Stock is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.\nListing of Class A common stock and Public Warrants\nThe shares of Class A common stock and Public Warrants to are listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “BTM” to “BTMWW,” respectively.\n- 9 -\n\nExhibit 10.17\nScott Buchanan\nThis letter is to document your compensation for the 2024 calendar year, payable in accordance with our standard payroll process at the\nbeginning of March.\nYou will be paid a $50,000 bonus less applicable taxes and deductions, payable in accordance with our standard payroll process at the\nbeginning of March.

(the “Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain\na culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The\nCompany’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has therefore adopted this policy, which provides for the recoupment of certain executive\ncompensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to material\nnoncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws (this “Policy”). This Policy is designed to comply\nwith Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the rules promulgated thereunder, and the listing\nstandards of the national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\nADMINISTRATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”). Any\ndeterminations made by the Compensation Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nCOVERED EXECUTIVES\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s current and former executive officers (as determined by the Compensation Committee in\naccordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act, the rules promulgated thereunder, and the listing standards of the national securities\nexchange on which the Company’s securities are listed) and such other senior executives or employees who may from time to time be deemed\nsubject to this Policy by the Compensation Committee (collectively, the “Covered Executives”). This Policy shall be binding and enforceable\nagainst all Covered Executives.\nRECOUPMENT; ACCOUNTING RESTATEMENT\nIf the Audit Committee determines that the Company is materially noncompliant with any financial reporting requirement under the\nsecurities laws and is therefore required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements that either (i) corrects an error in\npreviously issued financial statements that is material to those previously issued financial statements (a “Big R Restatement”) or (ii) corrects an\nerror would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “little r\nrestatement” and, with a Big R Restatement, each an “Accounting Restatement”), it shall promptly report such determination to the Disclosure\nCommittee and the Compensation Committee, and the Compensation Committee will determine whether the Accounting Restatement results\nin an Overpayment (as defined below).\nIf the Compensation Committee determines that an Overpayment was made, it will report the Overpayment to the Audit Committee\nand the Disclosure Committee, and will reasonably\n4136-1003 / 2379059.2 1\npromptly require reimbursement or forfeiture of each Overpayment received by any Covered Executive (x) after beginning service as a\nCovered Executive, (y) who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for the applicable Incentive-Based\nCompensation (as defined below), and (z) during the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is\nrequired to prepare an Accounting Restatement and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or\nimmediately following those three (3) completed fiscal years.\nIf the Accounting Restatement is a Big R Restatement, the Disclosure Committee will ensure that an 8-K is promptly filed with the\nSEC.\nINCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based\nwholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure, including, but not limited to: (i) non-equity incentive plan awards that\nare earned solely or in part by satisfying a financial reporting measure performance goal; (ii) bonuses paid from a bonus pool, where the size of\nthe pool is determined solely or in part by satisfying a financial reporting measure performance goal; (iii) other cash awards based on\nsatisfaction of a financial reporting measure performance goal; (iv) restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation\nrights, and performance share units that are granted or vest solely or in part based on satisfaction of a financial reporting measure performance\ngoal; and (v) proceeds from the sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan that were granted or vested solely or in part based on\nsatisfaction of a financial reporting measure performance goal.\nCompensation that would not be considered Incentive-Based Compensation includes, but is not limited to: (i) salaries; (ii) bonuses\npaid solely based on satisfaction of subjective standards, such as demonstrating leadership, and/or completion of a specified employment\nperiod; (iii) non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely based on satisfaction of strategic or operational measures; (iv) wholly time-based\nequity awards; and (v) discretionary bonuses or other compensation that is not paid from a bonus pool that is determined by satisfying a\nfinancial reporting measure performance goal.\nA financial reporting measure is: (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used\nin preparing financial statements, or any measure derived wholly or in part from such measure, such as revenues, EBITDA, or net income and\n(ii) stock price and total shareholder return. Financial reporting measures include, but are not limited to: revenues; net income; operating\nincome; profitability of one or more reportable segments; financial ratios (e.g., accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover rates); net\nassets or net asset value per share; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; funds from operations and adjusted funds\nfrom operations; liquidity measures (e.g., working capital, operating cash flow); return measures (e.g., return on invested capital, return on\nassets); earnings measures (e.g., earnings per share); sales per square foot or same store sales, where sales is subject to an accounting\nrestatement; revenue per user, or average revenue per user, where revenue is subject to an accounting restatement; cost per employee, where\ncost is subject to an accounting restatement; any of such financial reporting measures relative to a peer group, where the Company’s financial\nreporting measure is subject to an accounting restatement; and tax basis income.\n4136-1003 / 2379059.2 2\nOVERPAYMENT: AMOUNT SUBJECT TO RECOVERY\nThe amount to be recovered will be the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-\nBased Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, and must be computed as\na gross amount, without regard to any taxes paid (the “Overpayment”). Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “received” in the Company’s\nfiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the vesting,\npayment or grant of the incentive-based compensation occurs after the end of that period. Repayment of the Overpayment by a Covered\nExecutive does not alter the current year income reporting with respect to such Covered Executive, nor the Company’s withholding obligations\nwith respect to the Covered Executive’s compensation in the recovery year.\nFor Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded\ncompensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Accounting Restatement, the amount must be\nbased on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the\nIncentive-Based Compensation was received, and the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate\nand provide such documentation to the exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\nMETHOD OF RECOUPMENT\nThe Compensation Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the method or methods for recouping any Overpayment\nhereunder which may include, without limitation:\n•requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously paid;\n•seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards\ngranted as Incentive-Based Compensation;\n•offsetting any or all of the Overpayment from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\n•cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n•taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Compensation Committee.\nLIMITATION ON RECOVERY; NO ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS\nThe right to recovery will be limited to Overpayments received during the three (3) completed fiscal years prior to the date on which the\nCompany is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year)\nwithin or immediately following those three (3) completed fiscal years. In no event shall the Company be required to award Covered\nExecutives an additional payment if the restated or accurate financial results would have resulted in a higher Incentive-Based Compensation\npayment.\n4136-1003 / 2379059.2 3\nNO INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly awarded Incentive-Based\nCompensation.\nINTERPRETATION\nThe Compensation Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary,\nappropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with\nthe requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission or any national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\nEFFECTIVE DATE\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the “Effective Date”) and shall apply to Incentive-Based\nCompensation (including Incentive-Based Compensation granted pursuant to arrangements existing prior to the Effective Date).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, this Policy shall only apply to Incentive-Based Compensation received (as determined pursuant to this Policy)\non or after the effective date of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608 or the applicable listing rules of the national securities exchange on which Company\nshares are traded.\nAMENDMENT; TERMINATION\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\nOTHER RECOUPMENT RIGHTS\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Compensation Committee may require that any\nemployment or service agreement, cash-based bonus plan or program, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after\nthe adoption of this Policy shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the\nterms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment\nthat may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement,\ncash-based bonus plan or program, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.\nIMPRACTICABILITY\nThe Compensation Committee shall recover any Overpayment in accordance with this Policy except to the extent that the\nCompensation Committee determines such recovery would be impracticable because:\n(A) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; or\n4136-1003 / 2379059.2 4\n(B) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees\nof the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\nSUCCESSORS\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or\nother legal representatives.\n4136-1003 / 2379059.2 5"
