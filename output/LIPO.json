These subjects were treated with up to two courses of LP-10 intravesical bladder instillations.\n\nAll subjects tolerated the LP-10 instillations and completed the study without report of product-related serious adverse events. LP-10 pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated short duration of systemic uptake, decreased cystoscopic bleeding and ulceration sites, and improved patients’ urinary symptoms.\n\n[**Click here to read more**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lipella-pharma-sees-positive-results-for-lp-10-phase-2a-trial-271673440759)\n\n#### All Press Releases\n\n[Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc](https://lipella.com/author/lpphetlgnhhtmgrfr/ \"Posts by Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc\")2024-03-18T13:44:25+00:00\n\n#### [A Message from Our CEO, Dr. Jonathan Kaufman](https://lipella.com/ceo-message-expanding-pipeline-target-rare-serious-diseases/)\n\n[Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc](https://lipella.com/author/lpphetlgnhhtmgrfr/ \"Posts by Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc\")2023-01-12T18:36:34+00:00\n\n#### [Lipella Pharma Sees Positive Results for LP-10 Phase 2a Trial](https://lipella.com/lipella-pharma-sees-positive-results-for-lp-10-phase-2a-trial/)\n\n[Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc](https://lipella.com/author/lpphetlgnhhtmgrfr/ \"Posts by Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc\")2023-01-12T18:34:07+00:00\n\n#### [Lipella Pharmaceuticals Announces Pricing of Initial Public Offering of Common Stock](https://lipella.com/lipella-pharmaceuticals-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-of-common-stock/)\n\n[Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc](https://lipella.com/author/lpphetlgnhhtmgrfr/ \"Posts by Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc\")2022-09-15T13:07:57+00:00\n\n#### [Announcing Radiation (and Hemorrhagic) Cystitis Patient Registry](https://lipella.com/announcing-radiation-and-hemorrhagic-cystitis-patient-registry/)\n\n[Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc](https://lipella.com/author/lpphetlgnhhtmgrfr/ \"Posts by Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc\")2022-09-15T13:06:49+00:00\n\n#### [Lipella Pharmaceuticals Announces Successful Completion of Pre-IND Type B FDA Meeting Regarding Oral Lichen Planus Drug Candidate](https://lipella.com/lipella-pharmaceuticals-announces-successful-completion-of-pre-ind-type-b-fda-meeting-regarding-oral-lichen-planus-drug-candidate/)\n\n[Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc](https://lipella.com/author/lpphetlgnhhtmgrfr/ \"Posts by Lipella Pharmaceuticals, Inc\")2023-01-12T18:36:34+00:00\n\n![](https://lipella.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lipella-main-logo-sm.png)\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/lipellapharmaceuticals/ \"Facebook\")[](tel:412-894-1853 \"Phone\")\n\n[_Lipella Pharmaceuticals Inc.
