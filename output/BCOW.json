Announces Balance Sheet Repositioning\n\nDecember 8, 2023\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s204.q4cdn.com/892889839/files/doc_news/1895-BANCORP-OF-WISCONSIN-INC.-ANNOUNCES-BALANCE-SHEET-REPOSITIONING-d515823d2-2023.pdf)\n\nGREENFIELD, Wis., Dec. 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ Capital Market: BCOW), the holding company for PyraMax Bank, FSB, announced today the completion of a second balance sheet repositioning strategy related to its investment securities portfolio.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/PyraMax Bank / 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1578767/1895_Bancorp_of_Wisconsin_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1578767/1895_Bancorp_of_Wisconsin_Logo.html)\n\nThe Company executed the sale of $28.1 million in book value of its lower-yielding investment securities for a pre-tax realized loss of approximately $2.7 million. These securities were classified as available-for-sale. Proceeds from the sale of these securities of $25.4 million were redeployed into approximately $28.7 million of U.S. government sponsored mortgage-backed securities, which were classified as available-for-sale upon purchase. The purchased securities have a positive spread differential of approximately 345 basis points over the securities that were sold, which is expected to result in $1.0 million in additional pre-tax earnings, on an annualized basis. The Company estimates that the loss on the sale of securities will be recouped within approximately 2.76 years. The effective duration of the securities sold was 3.6 years, while the effective duration of the securities purchased is 1.8 years.\n\nThe loss on the sale of securities has a neutral impact on shareholders' equity and the Company's book value per share. Upon execution of the repositioning strategy, PyraMax Bank's capital levels remain well in excess of those required to be categorized as well-capitalized. This repositioning is projected to be accretive to earnings, net interest margin and return on assets in future periods, and to provide the Company with greater flexibility in managing balance sheet growth.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements herein constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
