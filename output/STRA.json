We discuss management’s reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below, and the press release schedules that follow reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we reference. Although management evaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, total costs and expenses, income from operations, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable financial measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, we may calculate and/or present these non-GAAP financial measures differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others. \n\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate financial performance because those non-GAAP measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operations before the impact of certain items described below. Management believes this information is useful to investors to compare the Company’s results of operations period-over-period. These measures are Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS). We define Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to exclude (1) amortization and depreciation expense related to intangible assets and software assets associated with the Company’s acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand, (2) integration expenses associated with the Company’s merger with Capella Education Company and the Company’s acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand, (3) severance costs, asset impairment charges, gains on sale of real estate and early termination of leased facilities, and other costs associated with the Company’s restructuring activities, (4) income/loss recognized from the Company’s investments in partnership interests and other investments, and (5) discrete tax adjustments utilizing adjusted effective income tax rates of 30.0% and 29.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. To illustrate currency impacts to operating results, Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS for the three months ended June 30, 2024 are also presented on a constant currency basis utilizing an exchange rate of 0.67 Australian Dollars to U.S. Dollars, which was the average exchange rate for the same period in 2023. We define EBITDA as net income before other income (expense), the provision for income taxes, gains on sale of property and equipment, depreciation and amortization, and from this amount in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA we also exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense associated with deferred implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements, and the amounts in (2) and (3) above. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the sections that follow. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP measures. \n\n**STRATEGIC EDUCATION, INC.** **UNAUDITED RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES** **ADJUSTED REVENUE, ADJUSTED

We discuss management’s reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below, and the press release schedules that follow reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we reference. Although management evaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, total costs and expenses, income from operations, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable financial measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, we may calculate and/or present these non-GAAP financial measures differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others. \n\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate financial performance because those non-GAAP measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operations before the impact of certain items described below. Management believes this information is useful to investors to compare the Company’s results of operations period-over-period. These measures are Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS). We define Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to exclude (1) amortization and depreciation expense related to intangible assets and software assets associated with the Company’s acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand, (2) integration expenses associated with the Company’s merger with Capella Education Company and the Company’s acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand, (3) severance costs, asset impairment charges, gains on sale of real estate and early termination of leased facilities, and other costs associated with the Company’s restructuring activities, (4) income/loss recognized from the Company’s investments in partnership interests and other investments, and (5) discrete tax adjustments utilizing adjusted effective income tax rates of 30.0% and 29.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. To illustrate currency impacts to operating results, Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are also presented on a constant currency basis utilizing an exchange rate of 0.65 Australian Dollars to U.S. Dollars, which was the average exchange rate for the same period in 2023. We define EBITDA as net income before other income, the provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and from this amount in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA we also exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense associated with deferred implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements, and the amounts in (2) and (3) above. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the sections that follow. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP measures. \n\n**STRATEGIC EDUCATION, INC.** **UNAUDITED RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES** **ADJUSTED REVENUE, ADJUSTED

We discuss management’s reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below, and the press release schedules that follow reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we reference. Although management evaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, total costs and expenses, income from operations, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable financial measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, we may calculate and/or present these non-GAAP financial measures differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others. \n\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate financial performance because those non-GAAP measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operations before the impact of certain items described below. Management believes this information is useful to investors to compare the Company’s results of operations period-over-period. These measures are Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS). We define Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to exclude (1) amortization and depreciation expense related to intangible assets and software assets associated with the Company’s acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand, (2) integration expenses associated with the Company’s merger with Capella Education Company and the Company’s acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand, (3) severance costs, asset impairment charges, gains on sale of real estate and early termination of leased facilities, and other costs associated with the Company’s restructuring activities, (4) income/loss recognized from the Company’s investments in partnership interests and other investments, and (5) discrete tax adjustments utilizing adjusted effective income tax rates of 30.0% and 29.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. To illustrate currency impacts to operating results, Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are also presented on a constant currency basis utilizing an exchange rate of 0.65 Australian Dollars to U.S. Dollars, which was the average exchange rate for the same period in 2023. We define EBITDA as net income before other income, the provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and from this amount in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA we also exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense associated with deferred implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements, and the amounts in (2) and (3) above. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the sections that follow. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP measures. \n\n**STRATEGIC EDUCATION, INC.** **UNAUDITED RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES** **ADJUSTED REVENUE, ADJUSTED

STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n1. Nature of Operations\nStrategic Education, Inc. (“Strategic Education” or the “Company”), a Maryland corporation, is an education services company that\nprovides access to high-quality education through campus-based and online post-secondary education offerings, as well as through\nprograms to develop job-ready skills for high-demand markets. Strategic Education’s portfolio of companies is dedicated to closing the\nskills gap by placing adults on the most direct path between learning and employment.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes include the results of the Company’s three reportable\nsegments: (1) U.S. Higher Education (“USHE”), which is primarily comprised of Capella University and Strayer University and is\nfocused on providing flexible and affordable certificate and degree programs to working adults; (2) Education Technology Services,\nwhich primarily develops and maintains relationships with employers to build employee education benefits programs that provide\nemployees access to affordable and industry-relevant training, certificate, and degree programs; and (3) Australia/New Zealand, which\nthrough Torrens University and associated assets, provides certificate and degree programs in Australia and New Zealand. The\nCompany’s reportable segments are discussed further in Note 15.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nFinancial Statement Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nAll information as of, and for the three and nine months ended, September 30, 2023 and 2024 is unaudited but, in the opinion of\nmanagement, contains all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the condensed\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date. Certain amounts in the prior period\nhave been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included\nin financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)\nhave been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full fiscal year.\nBelow is a description of the nature of the costs included in the Company’s operating expense categories.\nInstructional and support costs generally contain items of expense directly attributable to activities that support students. This\nexpense category includes salaries and benefits of faculty and academic administrators, as well as admissions and administrative\npersonnel who support and serve student interests. Instructional and support costs also include course development costs and costs\nassociated with delivering course content, including educational supplies, facilities, and all other physical plant and occupancy\ncosts, with the exception of costs attributable to the corporate offices. Bad debt expense incurred on delinquent student account\nbalances is also included in instructional and support costs.\nGeneral and administration expenses include salaries and benefits of management and employees engaged in finance, human\nresources, legal, regulatory compliance, marketing and other corporate functions. Also included are the costs of advertising and\nproduction of marketing materials. General and administration expense also includes the facilities occupancy and other related\ncosts attributable to such functions.\nAmortization of intangible assets consists of amortization and depreciation expense related to intangible assets and software assets\nacquired through the Company’s acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand (“ANZ”).\nMerger and integration costs include integration expenses associated with the Company’s merger with Capella Education Company\nand the Company’s acquisition of ANZ.\nRestructuring costs include severance and other personnel-related expenses from voluntary and involuntary employee terminations,\nasset impairment charges, gains on sale of real estate and early termination of leased facilities, and other costs associated with the\nCompany’s restructuring activities. See Note 4 for additional information.\n8\nTable of Contents\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses\nThe United States Dollar (“USD”) is the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries operating in the United States. The\nfinancial statements of its foreign subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currencies. The functional currency of each of the\nforeign subsidiaries is the currency of the economic environment in which the subsidiary primarily does business. Financial statements\nof foreign subsidiaries are translated into USD using the exchange rates applicable to the dates of the financial statements. Assets and\nliabilities are translated into USD using the period-end spot foreign exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated at the weighted-\naverage exchange rates in effect during the period. Equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. The effects of these\ntranslation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity.\nFor any transaction that is in a currency different from the entity’s functional currency, the Company records a net gain or loss based on\nthe difference between the exchange rate at the transaction date and the exchange rate at the transaction settlement date (or rate at\nperiod end, if unsettled) in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.\nRestricted Cash\nIn the United States, a significant portion of the Company’s revenues are funded by various federal and state government programs.\nThe Company generally does not receive funds from these programs prior to the start of the corresponding academic term. The\nCompany may be required to return certain funds for students who withdraw from a U.S. higher education institution during the\nacademic term. The Company had approximately $1.8 million of these unpaid obligations as of December 31, 2023 and September 30,\n2024. In Australia and New Zealand, advance tuition payments from international students are required to be restricted until a student\ncommences his or her course. In addition, a portion of tuition prepayments from students enrolled in a vocational education and training\nprogram are held in trust by a third party law firm to adhere to tuition protection requirements. As of December 31, 2023 and\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $11.1 million and $9.4 million, respectively, of restricted cash related to these\nrequirements in Australia and New Zealand. These balances are recorded as restricted cash and included in other current assets in the\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAs part of conducting operations in Pennsylvania, the Company is required to maintain a “minimum protective endowment” of at least\n$0.5 million in an interest-bearing account as long as the Company operates its campuses in the state. The Company holds these funds\nin an interest-bearing account, which is included in other assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table illustrates the reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated statements of cash flows as of September 30, 2023 and 2024 (in thousands):\nAs of September 30,\n2023 2024\nCash and cash equivalents $ 167,707 $ 195,889\nRestricted cash included in other current assets 13,238 11,232\nRestricted cash included in other assets 500 500\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $ 181,445 $ 207,621\nMarketable Securities\nInvestments in marketable securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in marketable securities that the\nCompany has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity.\nInvestments in marketable securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or\navailable-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate designation of marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates\nsuch designation as of each balance sheet date. All of the Company’s marketable securities are designated as either held-to-maturity or\navailable-for-sale.\nThe Company’s available-for-sale marketable securities consist of tax-exempt municipal securities and corporate debt securities, which\nare carried at fair value as determined by quoted market prices or other inputs either directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace\nfor identical or similar assets, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recognized as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity. Management reviews the fair value of the portfolio at least quarterly, and\nevaluates individual securities with fair value below amortized cost at the balance sheet date for impairment. In order to determine\nwhether there is an impairment, management evaluates whether the Company intends to sell the impaired security and whether it is\nmore likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost basis.\n9\nTable of Contents\nIf management intends to sell an impaired debt security, or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security\nprior to recovering its amortized cost basis, an impairment is deemed to have occurred. The amount of an impairment related to a credit\nloss, or securities that management intends to sell before recovery, is recognized in earnings. The amount of an impairment on debt\nsecurities related to other factors is recorded consistent with changes in the fair value of all other available-for-sale securities as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity.\nThe cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts, interest,\ndividend income and realized gains and losses are included in other income. The contractual maturity date of available-for-sale\nsecurities is based on the days remaining to the effective maturity. The Company classifies marketable securities as either current or\nnon-current assets based on management’s intent with regard to usage of those funds, which is dependent upon the security’s maturity\ndate and liquidity considerations based on current market conditions. If management intends to hold the securities for longer than one\nyear as of the balance sheet date, they are classified as non-current.\nTuition Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company records tuition receivable and contract liabilities for its students upon the start of the academic term or program. Tuition\nreceivables are not collateralized; however, credit risk is minimized as a result of the diverse nature of the Company’s student bases and\nthrough the participation of the majority of the students in federally funded financial aid programs. An allowance for credit losses is\nestablished based upon historical collection rates by age of receivable and adjusted for reasonable expectations of future collection\nperformance, net of estimated recoveries. These collection rates incorporate historical performance based on a student’s current\nenrollment status, likelihood of future enrollment, degree mix trends and changes in the overall economic environment. In the event\nthat current collection trends differ from historical trends, an adjustment is made to the allowance for credit losses and bad debt\nexpense.\nThe Company’s current tuition receivable and allowance for credit losses were as follows as of December 31, 2023 and September 30,\n2024 (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 September 30, 2024\nTuition receivable $ 123,357 $ 156,068\nAllowance for credit losses (47,255) (50,273)\nTuition receivable, net $ 76,102 $ 105,795\nAn additional $2.5 million and $7.2 million of tuition receivable, net, are included in other assets as of December 31, 2023 and\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, because these amounts are expected to be collected after 12 months.\nThe following table illustrates changes in the Company’s current and non-current allowance for credit losses for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 (in thousands).\nFor the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nAllowance for credit losses, beginning of period $ 46,284 $ 46,787 $ 47,586 $ 47,605\nAdditions charged to expense 14,880 13,793 37,138 39,418\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries (12,469) (15,044) (36,029) (41,487)\nAllowance for credit losses, end of period $ 48,695 $ 45,536 $ 48,695 $ 45,536\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amount assigned to the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed in a business combination. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trade names, are recorded at fair value\non their acquisition date. An indefinite life was assigned to the trade names because they have the continued ability to generate cash\nflows indefinitely.\nGoodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed at least annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter, or\nmore frequently if events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of\nthe respective reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying amount. The Company identifies its reporting units\nby assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is\navailable, and management regularly reviews the operating results of those components.\n10\nTable of Contents\nFinite-lived intangible assets that are acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value on their acquisition dates and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Finite-lived intangible assets consist of student\nrelationships.\nThe Company reviews its finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such assets are not recoverable, a potential impairment loss is recognized to the\nextent the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.\nAuthorized Stock\nThe Company has authorized 32,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of which 24,406,816 and 24,569,439 shares were\nissued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company also has authorized 8,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Before any preferred stock may be issued, the Board of Directors\nmust establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, and the\nterms or conditions of the redemption of the preferred stock.\nIn July 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular, quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share of common stock. The\ndividend was paid on September 16, 2024.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding\nduring the periods. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming conversion or exercise of all\ndilutive unexercised stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units (“stock awards”). The dilutive effect of stock awards was\ndetermined using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the following are assumed to be used to repurchase\nshares of the Company’s common stock: (1) the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and (2) the amount of\ncompensation cost associated with the stock awards for future service not yet recognized by the Company. Stock awards are excluded\nfrom the computation of diluted earnings per share when their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2024 (in thousands):\nFor the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nWeighted average shares outstanding used to compute\nbasic earnings per share 23,365 23,422 23,415 23,418\nIncremental shares issuable upon the assumed\nexercise of stock options 3 5 4 5\nUnvested restricted stock and restricted stock units 502 746 533 714\nShares used to compute diluted earnings per share 23,870 24,173 23,952 24,137\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the diluted\nearnings per share calculation 276 — 219 —\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income includes net income and all changes in the Company’s equity during a period from non-owner sources, which\nfor the Company consists of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities, net of tax, and foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss was\n$34.2 million, net of tax of $0.1 million, and $23.2 million, net of tax of $0.1 million, respectively. There were no reclassifications out\nof accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the\nperiod reported. The most significant management estimates include allowances for credit losses, useful lives of property and\nequipment and intangible assets, incremental borrowing rates, potential sublease income and vacancy periods,\n11\nTable of Contents\naccrued expenses, forfeiture rates and the likelihood of achieving performance criteria for stock-based awards, value of free courses\nearned by students that will be redeemed in the future, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and the provision for income taxes.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires disclosure of\nsignificant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each\nreported measure of segment profit or loss. The standard also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as\nthe CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment\nperformance and deciding how to allocate resources. Additionally, ASU 2023-07 requires all segment disclosures to be provided on an\nannual and interim basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments must be applied retrospectively. We\nare currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740)—Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-\n09”), which requires disclosure of specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation. Further, the standard requires certain\ndisclosures of state versus federal income tax expense and taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments should be applied on a prospective basis although retrospective\napplication is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nOther ASUs recently issued by the FASB but not yet effective are not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n3. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenues primarily consist of tuition revenue arising from educational services provided in the form of classroom\ninstruction and online courses. Tuition revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of instruction, which varies\ndepending on the course format and chosen program of study. Capella University’s GuidedPath classes and Strayer University’s\neducational programs typically are offered on a quarterly basis, and such periods coincide with the Company’s quarterly financial\nreporting periods, while Capella University’s FlexPath courses are delivered over a twelve-week subscription period. Torrens\nUniversity offers the majority of its education programs on a trimester system having three primary academic terms, which all occur\nwithin the calendar year.\nThe following table presents the Company’s revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by material revenue category for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 (in thousands):\nFor the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nU.S. Higher Education Segment\nTuition, net of discounts, grants and scholarships $ 192,850 $ 198,873 $ 575,725 $ 616,175\nOther(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:20)(cid:0)(cid:12) 8,978 8,836 25,677 27,383\nTotal U.S. Higher Education Segment 201,828 207,709 601,402 643,558\nAustralia/New Zealand Segment\nTuition, net of discounts, grants and scholarships 61,667 69,973 165,855 184,611\nOther(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:20)(cid:0)(cid:12) 1,597 1,975 4,384 5,842\nTotal Australia/New Zealand Segment 63,264 71,948 170,239 190,453\nEducation Technology Services Segment(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:21)(cid:0)(cid:12) 20,844 26,301 58,581 74,463\nConsolidated revenue $ 285,936 $ 305,958 $ 830,222 $ 908,474\n_________________________________________\n(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:20)(cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)2 (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)S (cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)H (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U(cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)H (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)U(cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)P (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17)\n(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:21)(cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)( (cid:0)G (cid:0)X (cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)K (cid:0)Q (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)H (cid:0)U(cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)U(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)U(cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U(cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:17)\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the\n12\nTable of Contents\nfive-step revenue model under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 606”) to determine when\nrevenue is earned and recognized.\nArrangements with students may have multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates net tuition\nrevenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone\nselling prices based on the prices charged to customers and observable market prices. The standalone selling price of material rights to\nreceive free classes or scholarships in the future is estimated based on class tuition prices or amounts of scholarships, and likelihood of\nredemption based on historical student attendance and completion behavior.\nAt the start of each academic term or program, a contract liability is recorded for academic services to be provided, and a tuition\nreceivable is recorded for the portion of the tuition not paid in advance. Any cash received prior to the start of an academic term or\nprogram is recorded as a contract liability. Some students may be eligible for scholarship awards, the estimated value of which will be\nrealized in the future and is deducted from revenue when earned, based on historical student attendance and completion behavior.\nContract liabilities are recorded as a current or long-term liability in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets based on\nwhen the benefits are expected to be realized.\nCourse materials are available to enable students to access electronically all required materials for courses in which they enroll during\nthe quarter. Revenue derived from course materials is recognized ratably over the duration of the course as the Company provides the\nstudent with continuous access to these materials during the term. For sales of certain other course materials, the Company is\nconsidered the agent in the transaction, and as such, the Company recognizes revenue net of amounts owed to the vendor at the time of\nsale. Revenues also include certain academic fees recognized within the quarter of instruction, and certificate revenue and licensing\nrevenue, which are recognized as the services are provided.\nContract Liabilities – Graduation Fund\nStrayer University offers the Graduation Fund, which allows undergraduate students to earn tuition credits that are redeemable in the\nfinal year of a student’s course of study if he or she successfully remains in the program. Students registering in credit-bearing courses\nin any undergraduate degree program receive one free course for every three courses that the student successfully completes. To be\neligible, students must meet all of Strayer University’s admission requirements and must be enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program.\nStudents who have more than one consecutive term of non-attendance lose any Graduation Fund credits earned to date, but may earn\nand accumulate new credits if the student is reinstated or readmitted by Strayer University in the future.\nRevenue from students participating in the Graduation Fund is recorded in accordance with ASC 606. The Company defers the value of\nthe related performance obligation associated with the credits estimated to be redeemed in the future based on the underlying revenue\ntransactions that result in progress by the student toward earning the benefit. The Company’s estimate of the benefits that will be\nredeemed in the future is based on its historical experience of student persistence toward completion of a course of study within this\nprogram and similar programs. Each quarter, the Company assesses its assumptions underlying these estimates, and to date, any\nadjustments to the estimates have not been material. The amount estimated to be redeemed in the next 12 months is $20.4 million and is\nincluded as a current contract liability in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The remainder is expected to be\nredeemed within two to four years.\nThe table below presents activity in the contract liability related to the Graduation Fund (in thousands):\nFor the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 2024\nBalance at beginning of period $ 46,842 $ 44,480\nRevenue deferred 14,543 16,358\nBenefit redeemed (16,931) (17,054)\nBalance at end of period $ 44,454 $ 43,784\nContract Liabilities – Tuition Cap\nStudents in certain programs at Capella University and Strayer University may be eligible for tuition cap pricing, wherein their tuition\nis waived once the student has reached the designated dollar cap threshold for their program. The Company defers the value of the\nrelated performance obligation associated with this tuition benefit estimated to be redeemed in the future based on the underlying\nrevenue transactions that result in progress by the student towards reaching the tuition cap. The Company’s estimate of the benefits that\nwill be redeemed in the future is based on its historical experience of student persistence toward completion of a course of study within\nthese programs or similar programs. Each quarter, the Company assesses its assumptions underlying these\n13\nTable of Contents\nestimates. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the Company had $11.8 million and $14.7 million, respectively, of\ncontract liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets related to tuition cap benefits that are estimated to be\nredeemed in the future. The amount estimated to be redeemed in the next 12 months is $6.7 million and is included as a current contract\nliability in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nUnbilled Receivables – Student Tuition\nAcademic materials may be shipped to certain new undergraduate students in advance of the term of enrollment. Under ASC 606, the\nmaterials represent a performance obligation to which the Company allocates revenue based on the fair value of the materials relative to\nthe total fair value of all performance obligations in the arrangement with the student. When control of the materials passes to the\nstudent in advance of the term of enrollment, an unbilled receivable and related revenue are recorded.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nCertain commissions earned by third party international agents are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract\nwith customers in the Australia/New Zealand segment. These costs are deferred and then amortized over the period of benefit which\nranges from one year to two years.\n4. Restructuring and Related Charges\nThe Company incurs severance and other employee separation costs related to employee terminations that are not tied to a formal\nrestructuring plan. The Company incurred $2.9 million and $11.3 million of severance and other employee separation charges during\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and $0.6 million and $1.9 million during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to the elimination of certain positions.

Straight-line amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets reflects the pattern in which the\neconomic benefits of the assets were consumed over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible\nassets was $8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. All finite-lived intangible assets were fully amortized by the\nend of 2023.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization consist of trade names. The Company assigned an indefinite useful life to\nits trade name intangible assets, as it is believed these assets have the ability to generate cash flows indefinitely. In addition, there are\nno legal, regulatory, contractual, economic, or other factors to limit the useful life of the trade name intangibles.\nThe Company assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if\nevents occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the respective\nindefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying amount. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a $0.8 million\nindefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge, which is included in Restructuring costs on the unaudited condensed consolidated\nstatements of income.

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 September 30, 2024\nTrade payables $ 49,247 $ 56,642\nAccrued compensation and benefits 34,988 41,504\nAccrued student obligations and other 6,653 9,065\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 90,888 $ 107,211\n11. Long-Term Debt\nOn November 3, 2020, the Company entered into an amended credit facility (“Amended Credit Facility”), which, prior to the\nAmendment (as defined below) in October 2024, provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit\nFacility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $350 million. The Amended Credit Facility provides the Company with an option,\nsubject to obtaining additional loan commitments and satisfaction of certain conditions, to increase the commitments under the\nRevolving Credit Facility or establish one or more incremental term loans (each, an “Incremental Facility”) in the future in an aggregate\namount of up to the sum of (x) the greater of (A) $300 million and (B) 100% of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA (earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and noncash charges, such as stock-based compensation) calculated on a trailing four-quarter\nbasis and on a pro forma basis, and (y) if such Incremental Facility is incurred in connection with a permitted acquisition or other\npermitted investment, any amounts so long as the Company’s leverage ratio (calculated on a trailing four-quarter basis) on a pro forma\nbasis will be no greater than 1.75:1.00. In addition, the Amended Credit Facility provides for a subfacility for borrowings in certain\nforeign currencies in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $150 million. Prior to the Amendment, the maturity date of the\nAmended Credit Facility was November 3, 2025. The Company paid approximately $1.9 million in debt financing costs associated with\nthe Amended Credit Facility, and these costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the five-year term of the Amended Credit\nFacility.\nOn June 13, 2023, the Company amended its Revolving Credit Facility to replace references to LIBOR with alternative benchmark\nrates, including Term SOFR with respect to loans denominated in U.S. dollars, beginning on June 30, 2023. There were no other\nsignificant changes to the Revolving Credit Facility related to the amendment.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to Term SOFR or a base rate, plus a margin\nranging from 1.50% to 2.00% depending on the Company’s leverage ratio. The Company also is subject to a quarterly unused\ncommitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% per annum depending on the Company’s leverage ratio, times the daily unused amount\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Amended Credit Facility is guaranteed by all domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and secured by substantially all\nof the assets of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors. The Amended Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative\ncovenants, representations, warranties, events of default, and remedies upon default, including acceleration and rights to foreclose on\nthe collateral securing the Amended Credit Facility. In addition, the Amended Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain\nfinancial maintenance covenants, including:\n• A leverage ratio of not greater than 2.00 to 1.00. Leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt (net of unrestricted cash in\nan amount not to exceed $150 million) to trailing four-quarter EBITDA.\n19\nTable of Contents\n• A coverage ratio of not less than 1.75 to 1.00. Coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of trailing four-quarter EBITDA and rent\nexpense to trailing four-quarter interest and rent expense.\n• A U.S. Department of Education (the “Department” or “Department of Education”) Financial Responsibility Composite Score\nof not less than 1.0 for any fiscal year and not less than 1.5 for any two consecutive fiscal years.\nThe Company was in compliance with all the terms of the Amended Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $61.4 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, of which\napproximately $3.4 million was denominated in Australian dollars. In July 2024, the Company repaid the remaining $61.3 million\noutstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit\nFacility as of September 30, 2024.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the Company paid $5.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of interest\nand unused commitment fees related to its Revolving Credit Facility.\nDebt Amendment\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term\nLoan Agreement and Amendment to Other Loan Documents (the “Amendment”) with certain of its subsidiaries party thereto as\nsubsidiary guarantors, Truist Bank, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The Amendment, among other things,\n(i) extends the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from November 3, 2025 to October 18, 2029 and (ii) reduces the total\ncommitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from $350 million to $250 million.\nExcept as amended by the Amendment, the remaining terms of the Amended Credit Facility remain in full force and effect.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Amendment do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full\ntext of the Amendment which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Quarterly Report and incorporated by reference herein.\nThe Amendment had no impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n12.

Income Taxes\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of $14.8 million and $36.2\nmillion, respectively. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 include shortfall tax impacts of\napproximately $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to share-based payment arrangements.\nThe Company had $0.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Interest and penalties,\nincluding those related to uncertain tax positions, are included in the provision for income taxes in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated statements of income.\nThe Company paid $35.6 million and $39.5 million in income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively.\nThe tax years since 2020 remain open for federal tax examination, the tax years since 2019 remain open to examination by certain\nstates, and the tax years since 2018 remain open to examination by foreign taxing jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to\ntaxation.\n15. Segment Reporting\nStrategic Education is an educational services company that provides access to high-quality education through campus-based and\nonline post-secondary education offerings, as well as through programs to develop job-ready skills for high-demand markets. Strategic\nEducation’s portfolio of companies is dedicated to closing the skills gap by placing adults on the most direct path between learning and\nemployment. The Company’s organizational structure includes three operating and reportable segments: U.S. Higher Education,\nEducation Technology Services, and Australia/New Zealand.\nThe USHE segment provides flexible and affordable certificate and degree programs to working adults primarily through Capella\nUniversity and Strayer University, including the Jack Welch Management Institute MBA, which is a unit of Strayer University. USHE\nalso operates non-degree web and mobile application development courses through Hackbright Academy and Devmountain, which are\nunits of Strayer University.\nThe Education Technology Services segment develops and maintains relationships with employers to build employee education\nbenefits programs that provide employees access to affordable and industry-relevant training, certificate, and degree programs. The\nemployer relationships developed by the Education Technology Services segment are an important source of student enrollment for\nCapella University and Strayer University, and a significant portion of the revenue attributed to the Education Technology Services\nsegment is driven by the volume of enrollment derived from these employer relationships. Education Technology Services also supports\nemployer partners through Workforce Edge, a platform which provides employers a full-service education benefits administration\nsolution, and Sophia Learning, which offers low-cost online general education-level courses recommended by the American Council on\nEducation for credit at other colleges and universities.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe Australia/New Zealand segment is comprised of Torrens University, Think Education, and Media Design School in Australia and\nNew Zealand, which collectively offer certificate and degree programs in business, design, education, hospitality, healthcare, and\ntechnology through campuses in Australia, New Zealand, and online.\nRevenue and operating expenses are generally directly attributable to the segments. Inter-segment revenues are not presented\nseparately, as these amounts are immaterial. The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker does not evaluate operating segments\nusing asset information.\nA summary of financial information by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 is\npresented in the following table (in thousands):\nFor the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\nRevenues\nU.S. Higher Education $ 201,828 $ 207,709 $ 601,402 $ 643,558\nAustralia/New Zealand 63,264 71,948 170,239 190,453\nEducation Technology Services 20,844 26,301 58,581 74,463\nConsolidated revenues $ 285,936 $ 305,958 $ 830,222 $ 908,474\nIncome from operations\nU.S. Higher Education $ 10,412 $ 11,446 $ 26,742 $ 59,284\nAustralia/New Zealand 13,875 14,846 20,984 26,651\nEducation Technology Services 8,316 10,792 20,278 30,914\nAmortization of intangible assets (3,382) — (10,364) —\nMerger and integration costs (330) — (1,335) —\nRestructuring costs (3,262) (758) (15,208) 2,757\nConsolidated income from operations $ 25,629 $ 36,326 $ 41,097 $ 119,606\n16. Litigation\nThe Company is involved in litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business. Except as described\nbelow, there have been no material developments in the litigation and other legal proceedings that are described in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOn January 25, 2024, Capella University received notice that the Department received approximately 6,700 borrower defense to\nrepayment applications with claims for forgiveness of loans taken out at the university and filed between June 23, 2022 and November\n15, 2022. On February 1, 2024, Strayer University received notice that the Department received approximately 1,900 borrower defense\nto repayment applications with claims for forgiveness of loans taken out at the university and filed between June 23, 2022 and\nNovember 15, 2022. In the notices received, the Department indicated that: (1) the notification was occurring prior to any substantive\nreview of the applications as well as their adjudication; (2) it would send the applications to Capella University and Strayer University\nin batches of 500 per week; (3) it is optional for institutions to respond to the applications; and (4) not responding will result in no\nnegative inference by the Department. The Department has also explained that it will separately decide whether to seek recoupment on\nany approved claim and that any recoupment actions the Department chooses to initiate will have their own notification and response\nprocesses, which include providing additional evidence to the institution. The Department has indicated that an institution will learn of\nthe Department’s determination only if it approves a Borrower Defense to Repayment (“BDTR”) application and the Department seeks\nrecoupment. In relation to the separate 2021 notice received by Capella University, the Department indicated there were more than\n1,000 applications pending, but the Company only ever received approximately 500 actual claims, and after an exhaustive review and\nresponse process the Company believes that none properly stated a claim for loan forgiveness. Since the Department’s 2024 notices,\nCapella University has received approximately 6,770 applications, and Strayer University has received approximately 1,870\napplications. Each university has provided or will provide a response to the applications it received within the time allowed by the\nDepartment. At this time, the Company is unable to predict whether the Department will grant BDTR relief for the claims noticed on\nJanuary 25, 2024 and February 1, 2024, or if so, whether it will seek recoupment from Capella University or Strayer University. If the\nDepartment were to seek recoupment, Capella University and Strayer University would dispute and defend against such efforts.\nHowever, if the Department were to successfully seek recovery for the amounts of discharged loans from Strayer University and\nCapella University in future proceedings, any such recovery could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n22\nTable of Contents\n17. Regulation\nOur higher education institutions are subject to uncertain and varying laws and regulations, and any changes to these laws or\nregulations or their application to us may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Other\nthan as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the laws and regulations affecting our higher education institutions that\nare described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nUnited States Regulation\nGainful Employment\nUnder the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution offering programs of study other than a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts\n(for which there is a limited statutory exception) must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. On October\n31, 2014, the Department of Education published final regulations related to gainful employment. The regulation went into effect on\nJuly 1, 2015 (“2015 Regulations”), with the exception of new disclosure requirements, which generally went into effect January 1,\n2017, although some portions of those requirements were delayed until July 1, 2019.\nThe 2015 Regulations included two debt-to-earnings measures, consisting of an annual income rate and a discretionary income rate.\nThe annual income rate measured student debt in relation to earnings, and the discretionary income rate measured student debt in\nrelation to discretionary income. A program passed if the program’s graduates:\n• have an annual income rate ratio that does not exceed 8%; or\n• have a discretionary income rate that does not exceed 20%.\nIn addition, a program that did not pass either of the debt-to-earnings metrics and had an annual income rate between 8% and 12% or a\ndiscretionary income rate between 20% and 30% was considered to be in a warning zone. A program failed if the program’s graduates\nhad an annual income rate of 12% or greater and a discretionary income rate of 30% or greater. A program became Title IV-ineligible\nfor three years if it failed both metrics for two out of three consecutive years or failed to pass at least one metric for four consecutive\naward years.\nOn January 8, 2017, Capella University and Strayer University received their final 2015 debt-to-earnings measures. None of their\nprograms failed the debt-to-earnings metrics. One active Capella University program, the Masters of Science in Marriage and Family\nCounseling/Therapy, was “in the zone” and two active Strayer University programs, the Associate in Arts in Accounting and Associate\nin Arts in Business Administration, were “in the zone.” Each of those three programs remained fully eligible. The Department has not\nreleased any subsequent debt-to-earnings measures under the 2015 Regulations.\nOn July 1, 2019, the Department of Education released final gainful employment regulations, which contain a full repeal of the 2015\nRegulations, including all debt measures, reporting, disclosure, and certification requirements, effective July 1, 2020.\nOn December 8, 2021, the Department of Education announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare\nproposed regulations for, among other topics, gainful employment, via the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility rulemaking.\nMeetings of the negotiated rulemaking committee occurred in spring 2022 with the committee failing to reach consensus. On May 17,\n2023, the Department released proposed rules on financial value transparency and gainful employment, financial responsibility,\nadministrative capability, certification procedures, and ability to benefit. On September 27, 2023, the Department released final\nregulations on financial value transparency and gainful employment, which are largely consistent with the proposed rule. The gainful\nemployment final rule establishes two independent metrics, both of which must be passed by a gainful employment program subject to\nthe rule in order to maintain Title IV eligibility. Any gainful employment program that fails either or both metrics in a single year would\nbe required to provide a disclosure to current and prospective students, and any such program that fails the same metric in two out of\nthree consecutive years for which the program’s metrics are calculated would lose its access to federal financial aid. The two metrics\nare 1) a debt-to-earnings ratio that compares the median earnings of graduates who received federal financial aid to the median annual\npayments on loan debt borrowed for the program, which must be less than or equal to 8% of annual earnings or 20% of discretionary\nearnings, and 2) an earnings premium test that measures whether the typical graduates from a program that received federal financial\naid earn more than a typical high school graduate in their state (or, in some cases, nationally) and within a certain age range in the labor\nforce. A program that fails in two out of three consecutive years, or is voluntarily discontinued by the institution, would not be eligible\nto have Title IV reinstated for the program or launch and receive Title IV for a “substantially similar program” (generally defined as a\nprogram with the same four-digit CIP code) for a minimum of three years. The final rule describes that the Department will now\nmeasure earnings six years after graduation (instead of the proposed rule’s three years after graduation) for certain qualifying graduate\nprograms such as clinical psychology, marriage and family therapy, clinical social work, and clinical counseling. The final rule also\nincludes the requirement that, beginning July 1, 2026, all schools provide a link to a Department of Education-hosted website that\nincludes\n23\nTable of Contents\ninformation on cost, earnings, and licensure information, and the gainful employment metrics. The final gainful employment\nregulations took effect July 1, 2024. The Department has indicated that it will release metrics beginning in the 2025 financial aid award\nyear. Beginning July 1, 2026, if a program fails a metric, an institution must provide warnings to students and prospective students\nmeeting certain minimum requirements to be specified by the Department; programs that fail the same metric in the first two years the\nrates are issued will lose eligibility in 2026. On December 22, 2023, a lawsuit was filed against the Department in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging that the rulemaking process and final rule were based on arbitrary and\ncapricious decisions made by the Department, and that the rule violates constitutional rights related to speech, equal protection, and due\nprocess. On March 20, 2024, another lawsuit was filed against the Department in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Texas seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the Department from enforcing the final rule on the grounds\nthat the rule exceeds the Department’s statutory authority, and is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise is not in\naccordance with law, and the motion for preliminary injunction was denied on June 20, 2024. On July 2, 2024, the court consolidated\nthe two Gainful Employment cases into one. Capella University and Strayer University are not parties to the lawsuits. The Company is\nunable to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation.\nIn a March 29, 2024 Electronic Announcement (GE-24-01), the Department released additional information and updates to help\ninstitutions prepare for complying with the Financial Value Transparency (“FVT”) and Gainful Employment (“GE”) Regulations,\nincluding that the deadline for initial institutional data reporting has been extended from July 31, 2024 to October 1, 2024. The\nDepartment indicated that in early 2025, it plans to publish the FVT/GE metrics and notify institutions of failing GE programs, as well\nas provide additional information on the program eligibility effects of the metrics on failing GE programs. In a September 13, 2024\nElectronic Announcement (GE-24-08), the Department announced the deadline for initial institutional data reporting has been further\nextended from October 1, 2024 to January 15, 2025.\nBorrower Defenses to Repayment\nPursuant to the Higher Education Act and following negotiated rulemaking, on November 1, 2016, the Department of Education\nreleased a final regulation specifying the acts or omissions of an institution that a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a\nloan made under the Direct Loan Program and the consequences of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions, and the\nSecretary of Education (the “2016 BDTR Rule”). Under the 2016 BDTR Rule, for Direct Loans disbursed after July 1, 2017, a student\nborrower may assert a defense to repayment if: (1) the student borrower obtained a state or federal court judgment against the\ninstitution; (2) the institution failed to perform on a contract with the student; and/or (3) the institution committed a “substantial\nmisrepresentation” on which the borrower reasonably relied to his or her detriment.\nThese defenses are asserted through claims submitted to the Department of Education, and the Department has the authority to issue a\nfinal decision. In addition, the regulation permits the Department to grant relief to an individual or group of individuals, including\nindividuals who have not applied to the Department seeking relief. If a defense is successfully raised, the Department has discretion to\ninitiate action to collect from an institution the amount of losses incurred based on the borrower defense. The 2016 BDTR Rule also\namends the rules concerning discharge of federal student loans when a school or campus closes and prohibits pre-dispute arbitration\nagreements and class action waivers for borrower defense-type claims. On January 19, 2017, the Department of Education issued a\nfinal rule, updating the hearing procedures for actions to establish liability against an institution of higher education and establishing\nprocedures for recovery proceedings under the borrower defense regulations. Several times between June 2017 and February 2018, the\nDepartment of Education announced delays until July 1, 2019 of implementation of certain portions of the 2016 BDTR Rule, including\nthose portions of the regulations that establish a new federal standard and a process for determining whether a Direct Loan borrower\nhas a defense to repayment of a Direct Loan based on an act or omission of an institution. However, in October 2018, a judge denied a\nrequest to delay implementation of portions of the regulations, and as a result the 2016 BDTR Rule went into effect as of October 16,\n2018.\nOn September 23, 2019, the Department published final Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations (the “2019 BDTR Rule”), which\ngoverns borrower defense to repayment claims in connection with loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020. Under the 2019 BDTR\nRule, an individual borrower can assert a defense to repayment and be eligible for relief if she or he establishes, by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, that (1) the institution at which the borrower enrolled made a misrepresentation of material fact upon which the borrower\nreasonably relied in deciding to obtain a Direct Loan or a loan repaid by a Direct Consolidation Loan; (2) the misrepresentation directly\nand clearly related to the borrower’s enrollment or continuing enrollment at the institution or the institution’s provision of education\nservices for which the loan was made; and (3) the borrower was financially harmed by the misrepresentation. The Department will\ngrant forbearance on all loans related to a claim at the time the claim is made.\nThe 2019 BDTR Rule defines “financial harm” as the amount of monetary loss that a borrower incurs as a consequence of a\nmisrepresentation. The Department will determine financial harm based upon individual earnings and circumstances, which must\ninclude consideration of the individual borrower’s career experience subsequent to enrollment and may include, among other factors,\nevidence of program-level median or mean earnings. “Financial harm” does not include damages for nonmonetary loss,\n24\nTable of Contents\nand the act of taking out a Direct Loan, alone, does not constitute evidence of financial harm. Financial harm also cannot be\npredominantly due to intervening local, regional, national economic or labor market conditions, nor can it arise from the borrower’s\nvoluntary change in occupation or decision to pursue less than full-time work or decision not to work. The 2019 BDTR Rule contains\ncertain limitations and procedural protections. Among the most prominent of these restrictions, the regulation contains a three-year\nlimitation period of claims, measured from the student’s separation from the institution, does not permit claims to be filed on behalf of\ngroups, and requires that institutions receive access to any evidence in the Department’s possession to inform its response. The 2019\nBDTR Rule permits the usage of pre-dispute arbitration agreements as a condition of enrollment, so long as the institution provides\nplain-language disclosures to students and the disclosure is placed on the institution’s website. The regulations also allow for a\nborrower to choose whether to apply for a closed school loan discharge or accept a teach-out opportunity. In addition, the closed school\ndischarge window is expanded from 120 days to 180 days prior to the school’s closure, though the final rule does not allow for an\nautomatic closed school loan discharge.\nInstitutions are required to accept responsibility for the repayment of amounts discharged by the Secretary pursuant to the borrower\ndefense to repayment, closed school discharge (associated with closure of a school or an additional location or branch campus), false\ncertification discharge, and unpaid refund discharge regulations. If the Secretary discharges a loan in whole or in part, the Department\nof Education may require the school to repay the amount of the discharged loan.\nOn August 10, 2021, the Department of Education announced its intention to establish a rulemaking committee to develop proposed\nregulations on, among other things, Borrower Defense to Repayment. Negotiated rulemaking committee meetings completed in\nDecember 2021 with no consensus reached on the topic. On July 6, 2022, the Department released proposed Borrower Defense to\nRepayment regulations for public comment and subsequently published a final rule on October 31, 2022 (the “2022 BDTR Rule”).\nAmong other things, the 2022 BDTR Rule sets a single standard and streamlined process for relief that will apply to all future and\npending Borrower Defense to Repayment claims as of July 1, 2023, regardless of the date of a borrower’s loan disbursement; defines\nthe types of misconduct that could lead to borrower defense discharges, including substantial misrepresentations, substantial omissions\nof fact, breaches of contract, aggressive and deceptive recruitment, and state or federal judgments or final Department of Education\nactions that could give rise to a Borrower Defense to Repayment claim; establishes a presumption that borrowers reasonably relied\nupon misrepresentations or omissions; establishes a reconsideration process for borrowers whose claims are not approved for a full\ndischarge, including based on a state law standard; and creates a process for the adjudication of group claims based on common facts.\nThe 2022 BDTR Rule permits nonprofit legal assistance organizations to request group claims. The 2022 BDTR Rule also establishes a\nrecoupment process separate from the approval of Borrower Defense to Repayment claims. In addition, the 2022 BDTR Rule prohibits\ninstitutions from requiring borrowers to sign mandatory pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers for claims related to\nthe making of a Federal Direct Loan or the provision of educational services for which the loan was obtained. The 2022 BDTR Rule\nalso modified the closed school discharge rule to provide an automatic discharge one year after an institution or location’s closure date\nfor borrowers who were enrolled at the time of closure or left 180 days before closure and who do not accept an approved teach-out\nagreement or continuation of the program at another location of the school; those who accept but do not complete a teach-out\nagreement or program continuation will receive a discharge one year after their last date of attendance. The 2022 BDTR Rule became\neffective July 1, 2023.\nOn August 7, 2023, in the matter of Career Colleges and Schs. of Tex. vs. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., et al. (No. 23-50491), the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit granted a nationwide emergency injunction preventing the Department of Education’s enforcement of the\n2022 BDTR Rule. On April 4, 2024, the Fifth Circuit reversed the underlying district court decision denying injunctive relief and\nremanded the case to the district court with instructions to enjoin and postpone the effective date of the 2022 BDTR Rule pending final\njudgment. The Department petitioned the Fifth Circuit for panel rehearing, which the Fifth Circuit denied on June 12, 2024. On October\n10, 2024, the Department timely filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, seeking review by the Supreme Court of the United States. The\nRespondent’s (i.e., Career Colleges and Schools of Texas) response to the Department’s petition is due December 12, 2024. The\nDepartment has previously stated that it will not adjudicate any borrower defense applications under the latest rule unless and until the\neffective date is reinstated. The Department will continue to adjudicate borrower defense applications using an earlier version of the\nregulations where required under the court settlement in the Sweet matter discussed in Note 21, Litigation, to the consolidated financial\nstatements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company is unable to predict the\nultimate outcome of the litigation.\nState Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA)\nCapella University and Strayer University participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”), which allows the\nUniversities to enroll students in distance education programs in each SARA member state, including 49 states, the District of\nColumbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each of the Universities applies separately to non-SARA member states (i.e.,\nCalifornia) for authorization to enroll students, if such authorization is required by the state. On January 16, 2024, SARA’s coordinating\nentity, the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (“NC-SARA”), initiated its 2024 policy\n25\nTable of Contents\nmanual modification process with a call for proposals for SARA policy changes. The call for proposals ended February 2, 2024 and\nyielded 50 proposed changes to NC-SARA policies, some of which, if adopted, could significantly alter the distance education\nreciprocity agreements. Such proposals include that an institution may be denied participation in SARA if it violates any requirement\nrelated to state authorization, accreditation, or participation in federal Title IV financial aid programs; and that an institution may be\ndenied participation in SARA or have its participation limited as a result of adverse actions against it related to the institution’s\nacademic quality, financial stability, or student consumer protection issues. On April 26, 2024, NC-SARA held its public comment\nforum to seek input on these potential changes. In addition to the public comment forum, NC-SARA accepted written comments\nbetween April 15, 2024 and May 17, 2024. On September 10, 2024, NC-SARA announced that the four regional compacts/regional\nsteering committees approved 10 policy change proposals, which include proposed changes related to when an institution may be\nplaced on provisional status and when a state must deny or may exercise its discretion to deny an institution’s participation in SARA.\nThe NC-SARA board of directors approved the proposals on October 23-25, 2024, concluding the 2024 policy modification process.\nThe adoption of certain proposals, including those described above to the extent they affect the ability of institutions to participate in\nthe agreements, could have a material adverse effect on Capella University, Strayer University, and the Company.\nBeginning in January 2024, the Department convened a negotiated rulemaking committee to consider new proposed regulations on,\namong other things, state authorization and state authorization reciprocity agreements. Negotiated rulemaking committee meetings\nconcluded in March 2024 with no consensus reached on the topics. In the absence of consensus, the Department of Education has\ndiscretion to propose a rule for public comment. We cannot predict whether the Department of Education will promulgate any\nregulations that would negatively affect Capella University or Strayer University.\nNegotiated Rulemaking\nBeginning January 2024, the Department convened negotiated rulemaking committee meetings to consider new proposed regulations\non distance education, cash management, return of federal funds, state authorization, accreditation and related issues, and TRIO\nprograms. Negotiated rulemaking committee meetings concluded in March 2024. Consensus was reached on TRIO programs but no\nother topics. In the absence of consensus, the Department of Education has discretion to propose a rule for public comment. On July 17,\n2024, the Department released proposed rules on distance education, return of federal funds, and TRIO programs. The proposed rules\nrelated to distance education would, among other things, establish a “virtual location” as a distinct type of additional location for Title\nIV purposes and define “distance education course” to include courses that are offered exclusively through distance education,\nnotwithstanding in-person non-instructional requirements (such as orientation, testing, academic support services, or residency\nexperiences). The proposed rules also would require institutions to report each Title IV recipient’s enrollment in distance education or\ncorrespondence courses. The proposed rules would also require an institution to take attendance, for the purposes of the Title IV return\ncalculation (“R2T4”), for each course offered entirely through distance education, except for doctoral dissertation research courses. The\nDepartment accepted public comments through August 23, 2024.\nOn July 17, 2024, the Department of Education also announced that it intends to publish proposed regulations related to state\nauthorization (including state authorization reciprocity agreements), cash management and accreditation by the end of the year, and that\nthe Department intends to convene a negotiated rulemaking process to consider regulations related to third party servicers broadly. We\ncannot predict whether the Department of Education will promulgate any regulations that would negatively affect Capella University or\nStrayer University.\nTitle IX\nOn April 19, 2024, the U.S. Department of Education released its final rule regarding the implementation of Title IX, which prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex in education programs that receive funding from the federal government. The new rule applies to all\nforms of sex-based harassment (not only sexual harassment); clarifies that Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination includes\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender\nidentity; and eliminates the requirement for live hearings with an opportunity for cross-examination at the post-secondary level.\nMultiple states have joined lawsuits against the Department challenging the new rules, and federal district courts have granted\npreliminary injunctions enjoining the Department from enforcing the final rule in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,\nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South\nCarolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Certain courts have issued orders expanding\nthe injunction to named schools, irrespective of where those schools are located; Capella University and Strayer University were named\namong nearly 700 schools in one such order on July 15, 2024. Kansas v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 5:24-cv-4041 (D. Kan. 2024). Except\nwhere enjoined, the new rules otherwise became effective on August 1, 2024.\n26\nTable of Contents\nAustralia Regulation\nOn May 16, 2024, the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024, which would amend the\nEducation Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, was introduced into the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament. On\nAugust 15, 2024, the Bill was introduced into the Senate of the Australian Parliament. The Bill contains several measures that would\nauthorize the Minister for Education to regulate the provision of education to overseas students, including, among other things, by\nlimiting the enrollments of overseas students. These limits would apply to Torrens University and to Think Education. The Company is\nunable to predict the final specific limits or their effect at this time.\n27\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read in\nconjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information\nincluded elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and\nother financial information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain of the statements included in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nas well as elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (“Reform Act”).

(“SEI,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “the Company”) is an education services company that provides access to high-\nquality education through campus-based and online post-secondary education offerings, as well as through programs to develop job-\nready skills for high-demand markets. We operate primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Capella University and Strayer\nUniversity, both accredited post-secondary institutions of higher education located in the United States, and Torrens University, an\naccredited post-secondary institution of higher education located in Australia. Our operations also include the Education Technology\nServices segment, which develops and maintains relationships with employers to build employee education benefits programs that\nprovide employees access to affordable and industry-relevant training, certificate, and degree programs.\n28\n\nTable of Contents\nSegments Overview\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had the following reportable segments:\nU.S. Higher Education (“USHE”) Segment\n• The USHE segment provides flexible and affordable certificate and degree programs to working adults primarily through\nCapella University and Strayer University, including the Jack Welch Management Institute MBA, which is a unit of Strayer\nUniversity. USHE also operates non-degree web and mobile application development courses through Hackbright Academy\nand Devmountain, which are units of Strayer University.\n• Capella University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and Strayer University is accredited by the Middle States\nCommission on Higher Education, both higher education institutional accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Department\nof Education. The USHE segment provides academic offerings both online and in physical classrooms, helping working adult\nstudents develop specific competencies they can apply in their workplace.\n• In the third quarter of 2024, USHE enrollment increased 4.8% to 86,533 compared to 82,548 for the same period in 2023.\n• Trailing 4-quarter student persistence within USHE was 87.0% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 87.3% for the same\nperiod in 2023. Student persistence is calculated as the rate of students continuing from one quarter to the next, adjusted for\ngraduates, on a trailing 4-quarter basis. Student persistence is reported one quarter in arrears. The table below summarizes\nUSHE trailing 4-quarter student persistence for the past 8 quarters.\nQ3 2022 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024\n87.7 % 87.4 % 87.4 % 87.3 % 87.4 % 87.0 % 86.9 % 87.0 %\n• Trailing 4-quarter government provided grants and loans per credit earned within USHE decreased 3.8% as of the end of the\nsecond quarter of 2024. Government provided grants and loans per credit earned includes all Federal loans and grants for\nstudents (Title IV hereafter) in our USHE institutions, and is calculated on a trailing 4-quarter basis and reported one quarter in\narrears. Title IV per credit earned has been declining as employer-affiliated enrollment has grown, and as more students earn\ncredit through Sophia Learning and other affordable alternative pathways. The table below summarizes the percentage change\nin USHE trailing 4-quarter Title IV per credit earned for the past 8 quarters.\nQ3 2022 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024\n(5.3)% (6.2)% (7.2)% (7.4)% (8.3)% (7.4)% (5.0)% (3.8)%\nEducation Technology Services Segment\n• Our Education Technology Services segment develops and maintains relationships with employers to build employee\neducation benefits programs that provide employees access to affordable and industry-relevant training, certificate, and degree\nprograms. The employer relationships developed by the Education Technology Services segment are an important source of\nstudent enrollment for Capella University and Strayer University, and a significant portion of the revenue attributed to the\nEducation Technology Services segment is driven by the volume of enrollment derived from these employer relationships.\nEnrollments attributed to the Education Technology Services segment are determined based on a student’s employment status\nand the existence of a corporate partnership arrangement with SEI. All enrollments attributed to the Education Technology\nServices segment continue to be attributed to the segment until the student graduates or withdraws, even if his or her\nemployment status changes or if the partnership contract expires.\n• In the third quarter of 2024, employer affiliated enrollment as a percentage of USHE enrollment was 29.8% compared to\n27.8% for the same period in 2023.\n• Education Technology Services also supports employer partners through Workforce Edge, a platform which provides\nemployers a full-service education benefits administration solution, and Sophia Learning, which offers low-cost online general\neducation-level courses recommended by the American Council on Education for credit at other colleges and universities.\nAustralia/New Zealand (“ANZ”) Segment\n• Torrens University is the only investor-funded university in Australia. Torrens University offers undergraduate, graduate,\nhigher degree by research, and specialized degree courses primarily in five fields of study: business, design and creative\ntechnology, health, hospitality, and education. Courses are offered both online and at physical campuses. Torrens\n29\nTable of Contents\nUniversity is registered with the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (“TEQSA”), the regulator for higher\neducation providers and universities throughout Australia, as an Australian University that is authorized to self-accredit its\ncourses.\n• Think Education is a vocational registered training organization and accredited higher education provider in Australia. Think\nEducation delivers education services at several campuses in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Adelaide as well as through\nonline study. Think Education and its colleges are accredited in Australia by the TEQSA and the Australian Skills Quality\nAuthority, the regulator for vocational education and training organizations that operate in Australia.\n• Media Design School is a private tertiary institution for creative and technology qualifications in New Zealand. Media Design\nSchool offers industry-endorsed courses in 3D animation and visual effects, game art, game programming, graphic and motion\ndesign, digital media, artificial intelligence, and creative advertising. Media Design School is accredited in New Zealand by\nthe New Zealand Qualifications Authority, the organization responsible for the quality assurance of non-university tertiary\ntraining providers.\n• In the third quarter of 2024, Australia/New Zealand enrollment increased 5.1% to 19,205 compared to 18,279 for the same\nperiod in 2023.\nWe believe we have the right operating strategies in place to provide the most direct path between learning and employment for our\nstudents. We are constantly innovating to differentiate ourselves in our markets and drive growth by supporting student success,\nproducing affordable degrees, optimizing our comprehensive marketing strategy, serving a broader set of our students’ professional\nneeds, and establishing new growth platforms. The talent of our faculty and employees, supported by market leading technology, enable\nthese strategies. We believe our strategy will allow us to continue to deliver high quality, affordable education, resulting in continued\ngrowth over the long-term. We will continue to invest in this strategy to strengthen the foundation and future of our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” discusses our consolidated financial\nstatements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments related to its allowance for credit losses; income tax\nprovisions; the useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets; redemption rates for scholarship programs and valuation of\ncontract liabilities; fair value of right-of-use lease assets for facilities that have been vacated; incremental borrowing rates; valuation of\ndeferred tax assets, goodwill, and intangible assets; forfeiture rates and achievability of performance targets for stock-based\ncompensation plans; and accrued expenses. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other\nfactors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly\nreviews its estimates and judgments for reasonableness and may modify them in the future. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes that the following critical accounting policies are its more significant judgments and estimates used in the\npreparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue recognition — Capella University and Strayer University offer educational programs primarily on a quarter system having\nfour academic terms, which generally coincide with our quarterly financial reporting periods. Torrens University offers the majority of\nits education programs on a trimester system having three primary academic terms, which all occur within the calendar year.\nApproximately 96% of our revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of tuition revenue. Capella University\noffers monthly start options for new students, who then transition to a quarterly schedule. Capella University also offers its FlexPath\nprogram, which allows students to determine their 12-week billing session schedule after they complete their first course. Tuition\nrevenue for all students is recognized ratably over the period of instruction as the universities provide academic services, whether\ndelivered in person at a physical campus or online. Tuition revenue is shown net of any refunds, withdrawals, discounts, and\nscholarships. The universities also derive revenue from other sources such as textbook-related income, certificate revenue, certain\nacademic fees, licensing revenue, accommodation revenue, and food and beverage fees, which are all recognized when earned. In\naccordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue Recognition, materials provided to students in connection with their\nenrollment in a course are recognized as revenue when control of those materials transfers to the student. At the start of each academic\nterm or program, a contract liability is recorded for academic services to be provided, and a tuition receivable is recorded for the\nportion of the tuition not paid in advance. Any cash received prior to the start of an academic term or program is recorded as a contract\nliability.\n30\nTable of Contents\nStudents at Capella University and Strayer University finance their education in a variety of ways, and historically about 75% of our\nstudents have participated in one or more financial aid program provided through Title IV of the Higher Education Act. In addition,\nmany of our working adult students finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers.\nThose students who are veterans or active duty military personnel have access to various additional government-funded educational\nbenefit programs.\nIn Australia, domestic students attending an ANZ institution finance their education themselves or by taking a loan through the national\nHigher Education Loan Program provided by the Australian government to support higher education. In New Zealand, domestic\nstudents may utilize government loans to fund tuition and may be eligible for a period of “fees free” study funded by the government.\nInternational students attending an ANZ institution are not eligible for funding from the Australian or New Zealand governments.\nA typical class is offered in weekly increments over a six- to twelve-week period, depending on the university and course type, and is\nfollowed by an exam. Student attendance is based on physical presence in class for on-ground classes. For online classes, attendance\nconsists of logging into one’s course shell and performing an academically-related activity (e.g., engaging in a discussion post or taking\na quiz).\nIf a student withdraws from a course prior to completion, a portion of the tuition may be refundable depending on when the withdrawal\noccurs. We use the student’s withdrawal date or last date of attendance for this purpose. Our specific refund policies vary across the\nuniversities and non-degree programs. For students attending Capella University, our refund policy varies based on course format.\nGuidedPath students are allowed a 100% refund through the first five days of the course, a 75% refund from six to twelve days, and 0%\nrefund for the remainder of the period. FlexPath students receive a 100% refund through the 12th calendar day of the course for their\nfirst billing session only and a 0% refund after that date and for all subsequent billing sessions. For students attending Strayer\nUniversity, our refund policy typically permits students who complete less than half of a course to receive a partial refund of tuition for\nthat course. For domestic students attending an ANZ institution, refunds are typically provided to students that withdraw within the first\n20% of a course term. For international students attending an ANZ institution, refunds are provided to students that withdraw prior to\nthe course commencement date. In limited circumstances, refunds to students attending an ANZ institution may be granted after these\ncut-offs subject to an application for special consideration by the student and approval of that application by the institution. Refunds\nreduce the tuition revenue that otherwise would have been recognized for that student. Since the academic terms coincide with our\nfinancial reporting periods for most programs, nearly all refunds are processed and recorded in the same quarter as the corresponding\nrevenue. For certain programs where courses may overlap a quarter-end date, we estimate a refund or withdrawal rate and do not\nrecognize the related revenue until the uncertainty related to the refund is resolved. The portion of tuition revenue refundable to\nstudents may vary based on the student’s state of residence.\nFor U.S. students who receive funding under Title IV and withdraw, funds are subject to return provisions as defined by the Department\nof Education. The university is responsible for returning Title IV funds to the Department and then may seek payment from the\nwithdrawn student of prorated tuition or other amounts charged to him or her. Loss of financial aid eligibility during an academic term\nis rare and would normally coincide with the student’s withdrawal from the institution. In Australia and New Zealand, government\nfunding for eligible students is provided directly to the institution on an estimated basis annually. The amount of government funding\nprovided is based on a course-by-course forecast of enrollments that the institution submits for the upcoming calendar year. Using the\nenrollment forecast provided as well as the requesting institution’s historical enrollment trends, the government approves a fixed\namount, which is then funded to the institution evenly on a monthly basis. Periodic reconciliation and true-ups are undertaken between\nthe relevant government authority and the institution based on actual eligible enrollments, which may result in a net amount being due\nto or from the government.\nStudents at Strayer University registering in credit-bearing courses in any undergraduate program qualify for the Graduation Fund,\nwhereby qualifying students earn tuition credits that are redeemable in the final year of a student’s course of study if he or she\nsuccessfully remains in the program. Students must meet all of Strayer University’s admission requirements and not be eligible for any\npreviously offered scholarship program. To maintain eligibility, students must be enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program. Students who\nhave more than one consecutive term of non-attendance lose any Graduation Fund credits earned to date, but may earn and accumulate\nnew credits if the student is reinstated or readmitted by Strayer University in the future. In their final academic year, qualifying students\nwill receive one free course for every three courses that the student successfully completed in prior years. Strayer University’s\nperformance obligation associated with free courses that may be redeemed in the future is valued based on a systematic and rational\nallocation of the cost of honoring the benefit earned to each of the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the student\ntoward earning the benefit. The estimated value of awards under the Graduation Fund that will be recognized in the future is based on\nhistorical experience of students’ persistence in completing their course of study and earning a degree and the tuition rate in effect at the\ntime it was associated with the transaction. Estimated redemption rates of eligible students vary based on their term of enrollment. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had deferred $43.8 million for\n31\nTable of Contents\nestimated redemptions earned under the Graduation Fund, as compared to $44.5 million at December 31, 2023. Each quarter, we assess\nour assumptions underlying our estimates for persistence and estimated redemptions based on actual experience. To date, any\nadjustments to our estimates have not been material. However, if actual persistence or redemption rates change, adjustments to the\nreserve may be necessary and could be material.\nTuition receivable — We record estimates for our allowance for credit losses related to tuition receivable from students primarily based\non our historical collection rates by age of receivable and adjusted for reasonable expectations of future collection performance, net of\nrecoveries. Our experience is that payment of outstanding balances is influenced by whether the student returns to the institution, as we\nrequire students to make payment arrangements for their outstanding balances prior to enrollment. Therefore, we monitor outstanding\ntuition receivable balances through subsequent terms, increasing the reserve on such balances over time as the likelihood of returning to\nthe institution diminishes and our historical experience indicates collection is less likely. We periodically assess our methodologies for\nestimating credit losses in consideration of actual experience. If the financial condition of our students were to deteriorate based on\ncurrent or expected future events resulting in evidence of impairment of their ability to make required payments for tuition payable to\nus, additional allowances or write-offs may be required. For the third quarter of 2024, our bad debt expense was 4.5% of revenue,\ncompared to 5.2% for the same period in 2023. A change in our allowance for credit losses of 1% of gross tuition receivable as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 would have changed our income from operations by approximately $1.6 million.\nGoodwill and intangible assets — Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amount\nassigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trade names, are recorded at fair\nmarket value on their acquisition date. At the time of acquisition, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are allocated to\nreporting units. Management identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute\nbusinesses for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of those\ncomponents. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed at least annually for impairment. No events or circumstances\noccurred in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to indicate an impairment to goodwill. Accordingly, no impairment\ncharges related to goodwill were recorded during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024. In the second quarter of\n2024, the Company recorded a $0.8 million indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge. There were no other impairment\ncharges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nFinite-lived intangible assets that are acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value on their acquisition dates and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Finite-lived intangible assets consist of student\nrelationships. We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such assets are not recoverable, a potential impairment loss is recognized to the\nextent the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. No impairment charges related to finite-lived intangible\nassets were recorded during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024.\nOther estimates — We record estimates for income tax liabilities and estimate the useful lives of our property and equipment and\nintangible assets. We also periodically review our assumed forfeiture rates and ability to achieve performance targets for stock-based\nawards and adjust them as necessary. Should actual results differ from our estimates, revisions to the carrying amount of property and\nequipment and intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and income tax liabilities may be required.\nResults of Operations\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we generated $306.0 million in revenue compared to $285.9 million for the same period in 2023. Our\nincome from operations was $36.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $25.6 million for the same period in 2023, primarily\ndue to higher revenue driven by enrollment growth in the USHE and Australia/New Zealand segments and growth in Sophia Learning\nsubscriptions in the Education Technology Services segment, lower restructuring costs, and lower amortization expense of intangible\nassets, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Net income in the third quarter of 2024 was $27.7 million compared to $18.5\nmillion for the same period in 2023, and diluted earnings per share was $1.15 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.77 for the\nsame period in 2023.

(cid:0)(cid:17)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $222.1 million compared to $208.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and $198.6 million at September 30, 2023. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market\nfunds and demand deposit bank accounts at high credit quality financial institutions, which are included in cash and cash equivalents at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, we invest excess cash in U.S. treasury bills with maturities of three months or less, which\nare included in cash and cash equivalents. We also hold marketable securities, which primarily include tax-exempt municipal securities,\ncorporate debt securities, and term deposits. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we earned interest income of\n$9.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively.\n37\n\nTable of Contents\nWe are party to a credit facility (the “Amended Credit Facility”), which, prior to the Amendment (as defined below) in October 2024,\nprovided for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to\n$350 million. The Amended Credit Facility provides us with an option, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and\nsatisfaction of certain conditions, to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility or establish one or more incremental\nterm loans (each, an “Incremental Facility”) in an amount up to the sum of (x) the greater of (A) $300 million and (B) 100% of the\nCompany’s consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and noncash charges, such as stock-based\ncompensation) calculated on a trailing four-quarter basis and on a pro forma basis, and (y) if such Incremental Facility is incurred in\nconnection with a permitted acquisition or other permitted investment, any amounts so long as the Company’s leverage ratio (calculated\non a trailing four-quarter basis) on a pro forma basis will be no greater than 1.75:1.00. In addition, the Amended Credit Facility\nprovides for a subfacility for borrowings in certain foreign currencies in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $150 million.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to Term SOFR or a base rate, plus a margin\nranging from 1.50% to 2.00%, depending on our leverage ratio. An unused commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% per annum,\ndepending on our leverage ratio, accrues on unused amounts. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants related to the\nAmended Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. In July 2024, we repaid the remaining $61.3 million outstanding balance under the\nRevolving Credit Facility. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and $61.2\nmillion outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, we paid $3.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively, of interest and unused commitment fees related to our Revolving Credit\nFacility.\nOn October 18, 2024, we entered into a Sixth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan\nAgreement and Amendment to Other Loan Documents (the “Amendment”) with certain of our subsidiaries party thereto as subsidiary\nguarantors, Truist Bank, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The Amendment, among other things, (i) extends\nthe maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility from November 3, 2025 to October 18, 2029 and (ii) reduces the total commitments\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility from $350 million to $250 million.\nExcept as amended by the Amendment, the remaining terms of the Amended Credit Facility remain in full force and effect.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Amendment do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full\ntext of the Amendment which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Quarterly Report and incorporated by reference herein.\nOur net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to $153.4 million, compared to\n$87.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily driven by higher earnings\nand favorable working capital.\nOur net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to $15.2 million, compared to $30.5\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a $20.9 million\nincrease in cash proceeds from marketable securities and other investments and a $2.2 million decrease in purchases of marketable\nsecurities, partially offset by $5.9 million of cash proceeds related to the sale of property and equipment in 2023 and higher capital\nexpenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Capital expenditures increased to $29.3 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $27.3 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to the timing of capital projects.\nOur net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to $114.1 million, compared to $99.1\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a $61.3 million long-\nterm debt payment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a $40.0 million long-term debt payment for the\nsame period in 2023, partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in share repurchases and a $1.4 million decrease in net payments for\nemployee stock awards.\nThe Board of Directors declared a regular, quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share of common stock in each of the first three\nquarters of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid a total of $44.3 million in cash dividends on our common\nstock, compared to $44.1 million for the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid $5.0 million\nto repurchase shares of common stock in the open market under our repurchase program, compared to $10.0 million for the same period\nin 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had $235.0 million of share repurchase authorization remaining to use through December 31,\n2024.\nFor the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue was 4.5% and 5.2%, respectively.\nOur recurring cash requirements consist primarily of general operating expenses, capital expenditures, discretionary dividend payments,\nincome tax payments, and contractual obligations related to our lease agreements, limited partnership investments, and Revolving\nCredit Facility. We believe that the combination of our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, cash\n38\nTable of Contents\ngenerated from operating activities, and if necessary, cash available under our Amended Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our\ncash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.\nITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to the impact of interest rate changes and may be subject to changes in the market values of our future investments. We\ninvest our excess cash in money market mutual funds, bank overnight deposits, U.S. treasury bills, and marketable securities. We have\nnot used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Earnings from investments in money market mutual funds, bank\novernight deposits, U.S. treasury bills, and marketable securities may be adversely affected in the future should interest rates decline,\nalthough such a decline may reduce the interest rate payable on any borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our future\ninvestment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell\nsecurities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, a 1% increase or decrease in\ninterest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings, fair values, or cash flows related to investments in cash\nequivalents or interest earning marketable securities.\nWe had no outstanding debt under our Amended Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the Amended Credit\nFacility bear interest at Term SOFR or a base rate, plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00%, depending on our leverage ratio. An\nunused commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.30%, depending on our leverage ratio, accrues on unused amounts under the\nAmended Credit Facility. An increase in Term SOFR would affect interest expense on any outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit\nFacility. For every 100 basis points increase in Term SOFR, we would incur an incremental $2.5 million in interest expense per year\nassuming the entire $250 million Revolving Credit Facility was utilized.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe United States Dollar (“USD”) is our reporting currency. The functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the currency\nof the economic environment in which the subsidiary primarily does business. Revenues denominated in currencies other than the USD\naccounted for 21.0% of our consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency\nrisk related to these currencies, which is primarily the Australian dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\nweakening of foreign currencies relative to the USD may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in the USD.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the average foreign currency exchange rates\nwould have decreased our consolidated revenues by approximately $19.0 million. In addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on\ncash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an increase of $1.5 million. We do not\nuse foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures.\nITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\na) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. Based upon such review, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that\nthe Company had in place, as of September 30, 2024, effective disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company (including consolidated subsidiaries) in the reports it files or submits\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the rules thereunder, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure\ncontrols and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by an issuer in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the\nCompany’s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nb) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n39\nTable of Contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. From time to time, certain\nmatters may arise that are other than ordinary and routine. The outcome of such matters is uncertain, and we may incur costs in the\nfuture to defend, settle, or otherwise resolve them. We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not, individually\nor in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However,\ndepending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect future results of\noperations in a particular period. See Note 16, Litigation, in the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in Part I, Item 1\nof this report for additional information regarding our legal proceedings and related matters, which information is incorporated herein\nby reference.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and\ncould cause you to suffer a partial or complete loss of your investment. There have been no material changes to the risk factors\npreviously described in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, other than as set forth below.

A proprietary institution of higher education that violates the 90/10 Rule for any\nfiscal year will be placed on provisional status for up to two fiscal years. For fiscal year 2023, Capella University derived\napproximately 66.79% of its cash-basis revenues from federal funds. For fiscal year 2023, using the formula specified in the Higher\nEducation Act, Strayer University derived approximately 89.48% of its cash-basis revenues from federal funds. On March 11, 2021,\nPresident Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which amends the 90/10 Rule to include “all federal education\nassistance” in the “90” side of the ratio calculation. The legislation required the Department to conduct a negotiated rulemaking process\nto modify related Department regulations, which was considered by the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility negotiated\nrulemaking committee. The Department of Education released final 90/10 regulations on October 27, 2022. The final regulations\nprovided for an expanded definition of “federal education assistance” that will be periodically defined by the Secretary. In addition, the\npreamble to the final rule and subsequent sub-regulatory guidance prohibit the inclusion of non-Title IV eligible programs offered in\npart or in full through distance education in the 10% calculation. On December 21, 2022, the Department released a list of federal\nagencies and federal education assistance programs that must be included as federal revenue in the 90/10 calculation. Such agencies\ninclude the U.S. Department of Defense (military tuition assistance) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (veterans education\nbenefits) in addition to the Title IV programs already covered by the 90/10 Rule. These revisions to the 90/10 Rule apply to institutional\nfiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. From time to time, legislation has been introduced in both chambers of Congress that\nseek to modify the 90/10 Rule further, including proposals to change the ratio requirement to 85/15 (federal to nonfederal revenue). We\ncannot predict whether Congress will pass any of these legislative proposals. If one of the Universities were to violate the 90/10 Rule,\nthe loss of eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCertain states have also proposed legislation that would prohibit enrollment of their residents based on a state and federal funding\nthreshold that is more restrictive than the federal 90/10 Rule. If such legislation were to be enacted, and the Universities were unable to\nmeet the threshold, loss of eligibility to enroll students in certain states would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n(cid:0), (cid:0)I (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)H (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)6 (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)I (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)F (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)L(cid:0)I (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)F (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J\n(cid:0)E (cid:0)R (cid:0)G (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)S (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)G (cid:0)X (cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)S (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)9 (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)P (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17)\nThe loss of Capella University’s accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission or the Higher Learning Commission’s loss of\nrecognition by the Department of Education would render Capella University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, the loss of Strayer University’s accreditation by the Middle States\n40\nTable of Contents\nCommission on Higher Education (“Middle States”) or Middle States’ loss of recognition by the Department of Education would render\nStrayer University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition,\nan adverse action by the Higher Learning Commission or Middle States other than loss of accreditation, such as issuance of a warning,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Higher Education Act charges the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (“NACIQI”) with\nrecommending to the Secretary of Education which accrediting or state approval agencies should be recognized as reliable authorities\nfor judging the quality of post-secondary institutions and programs. On May 31, 2023, the Department of Education, acting on the\nrecommendation of NACIQI renewed its recognition of the Higher Learning Commission for a period of five years and required it\nprovide a monitoring report regarding one item of substantial compliance, and continued the current recognition of Middle States for\none year, requiring a compliance report regarding one item of noncompliance. In an April 24, 2024 Federal Register notice, the\nDepartment requested written comments from the public by May 20, 2024 on Middle States and other accrediting agencies up for\nreview at the summer 2025 NACIQI meeting. Increased scrutiny of accreditors by the Secretary of Education in connection with the\nDepartment of Education’s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accreditors or have other adverse\nconsequences.\n(cid:0)7 (cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)S (cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0); (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U\n(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:17)\nCapella University and Strayer University must comply with the campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other\nrequirements in the Clery Act, including changes made to the Clery Act by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.\nOn October 20, 2014, the Department of Education promulgated final regulations implementing amendments to the Clery Act. In\naddition, the Department of Education has interpreted Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education\nprograms that receive funding from the federal government, to categorize sexual violence as a form of prohibited sex discrimination\nand to require institutions to follow certain disciplinary procedures with respect to such offenses. Failure to comply with the Clery Act\nor Title IX requirements or regulations thereunder could result in action by the Department of Education to require corrective action,\nfine the University, or limit or suspend its participation in Title IV programs, which could lead to litigation and could harm the\nUniversity’s reputation. In addition, individuals alleging sex discrimination may sue an institution under Title IX for corrective action\nand monetary damages.\nOn May 6, 2020, the Department of Education published final rules related to implementation of Title IX, which prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex in education programs that receive funding from the federal government. The final rules define what\nconstitutes sexual harassment for purposes of Title IX in the administrative enforcement context, describe what actions trigger an\ninstitution’s obligation to respond to incidents of alleged sexual harassment, and specify how an institution must respond to allegations\nof sexual harassment. Among other things, the 2020 rules include a requirement for live hearings on Title IX sexual harassment claims,\nwhich includes direct and cross-examination of parties, university-provided advisors (in the event a student or party does not provide an\nadvisor), rulings on questions of relevance by decision-makers, and the creation and maintenance of a record of the live hearing\nproceedings. The final rule became effective August 14, 2020. On August 24, 2021, the Department of Education Office for Civil\nRights issued guidance indicating it would cease enforcement of the rules’ prohibition against consideration of statements made by\nindividuals failing to submit to cross-examination at a live hearing.\nOn June 23, 2022, the Department of Education released proposed Title IX regulations for public comment, and on October 4, 2022 the\nDepartment of Education’s Office for Civil Rights released a resource document for students and institutions addressing pregnancy and\nrelated conditions. On April 19, 2024, the Department of Education released a new final rule regarding the implementation of Title IX,\nwhich prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs that receive funding from the federal government. The new\nrule applies to all forms of sex-based harassment (not only sexual harassment); clarifies that Title IX’s prohibition against sex\ndiscrimination includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual\norientation, and gender identity; and eliminates the requirement for live hearings with an opportunity for cross-examination at the post-\nsecondary level. Multiple states have joined lawsuits against the Department challenging the new rules, and federal district courts have\ngranted preliminary injunctions enjoining the Department from enforcing the final rule in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,\nIdaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South\nCarolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Certain courts have issued orders expanding\nthe injunction to named schools, irrespective of where those schools are located; Capella University and Strayer University were named\namong nearly 700 schools in one such order on July 15, 2024.

Except\nwhere enjoined, the new rules otherwise became effective on August 1, 2024.\nFailure to comply with these final rules and the resulting sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n41\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0), (cid:0)I (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)X (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)] (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\\n(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)S (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)9 (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)P (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:17)\nCapella University is registered as a private institution with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education, as required for most post-\nsecondary private institutions that grant degrees at the associate level or above in Minnesota and as required by the Higher Education\nAct to participate in Title IV programs. The loss of state authorization would, among other things, limit Capella University’s ability to\noperate in that state, render Capella University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, and could have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\nEach Strayer University campus is authorized to operate and to grant degrees, diplomas, or certificates by the applicable education\nagency or agencies of the state where the campus is located. Such state authorization is required for students at the campus to\nparticipate in Title IV programs. The loss of state authorization would, among other things, limit Strayer University’s ability to operate\nin that state, render Strayer University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs at least at those state campus locations, and could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nEffective July 1, 2011, Department of Education regulations provide that an institution is considered legally authorized by a state if the\nstate has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution, including enforcing applicable state laws,\nand the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements consistent with the new rules. If a state in\nwhich Capella University or Strayer University is located fails to comply in the future with the provisions of the new rule or fails to\nprovide the University with legal authorization, it could limit the University’s ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title\nIV programs at least for students in that state and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOn December 19, 2016, the Department of Education published final regulations addressing, among other issues, state authorization of\nprograms offered through distance education. The final regulations, which became effective on May 26, 2019, require an institution\noffering distance education programs to be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students (other than the state(s) in\nwhich the institution is physically located), if such authorization is required by the state, in order to award Title IV aid to such students.\nAn institution could obtain such authorization directly from the state or (except in California) through a state authorization reciprocity\nagreement. Under those rules, if one of the Universities should fail to obtain or maintain required state authorization to provide post-\nsecondary distance education in a specific state in which the institution is not physically located, the institution could lose its ability to\nprovide distance education in that state and to award Title IV aid to online students in that state. The 2016 rules require that schools\ndisclose all applicable prerequisites for licensure for professional programs and whether the school’s programs satisfy those\nprerequisites in each state where enrolled students reside. The institution must make direct disclosures to students and prospective\nstudents if the institution determines that a program does not meet a state’s professional licensure requirements. If an institution has not\nmade these determinations, it must make a general disclosure to the public to that effect. The disclosure rules have been modified by\nU.S. Department of Education regulations effective July 1, 2024, as described below. An institution must also notify students within 14\ndays if it determines that a program does not meet a state’s requirements. If one of the Universities failed to make any of these\ndisclosures, the Department of Education could limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in Title IV programs or impose other\npenalties such as requiring the Universities to make refunds, pay liabilities, or pay an administrative fine upon a material finding of\nnoncompliance.\nCapella University and Strayer University participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”), which originated\nafter the 2016 rulemaking and allows the Universities to enroll students in distance education programs in each SARA member state.\nEach of the Universities applies separately to non-SARA member states (i.e., California) for authorization to enroll students, if such\nauthorization is required by the state. If Capella University or Strayer University fails to comply with the requirements to participate in\nSARA or state licensing or authorization requirements to provide distance education in a non-SARA state, the University could lose its\nability to participate in SARA or may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization to provide distance education in that non-\nSARA state, respectively.\nOn November 1, 2019, the Department released final regulations on accreditation and state authorization of distance education, which\nbecame effective July 1, 2020. The rules maintain the requirement from the 2016 rule that institutions offering post-secondary\neducation through distance education or correspondence courses to students located in a state in which the institution is not located\nmeet state requirements in that state or participate in a state authorization reciprocity agreement. In addition, an institution must make\ndisclosures readily available to enrolled and prospective students regarding whether programs leading to professional licensure or\ncertification meet state educational requirements, and provide a direct disclosure to students in writing if the program leading to\nprofessional licensure or certification does not meet state educational requirements in the state in which the student is located, or if no\ndetermination for such state has been made by the institution. The disclosure rules have been modified by U.S. Department of\nEducation regulations effective July 1, 2024, as described below.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOn March 1, 2023, SARA’s coordinating entity, the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (“NC-SARA”),\nheld its first of two public comment forums to seek input on potential changes to NC-SARA policies. The forum included a discussion\nof 63 proposed policy changes, some of which, if adopted, would have significantly altered the distance education reciprocity\nagreements, including a proposal that NC-SARA permit states to apply more stringent standards to for-profit institutions or to eliminate\nthe ability of for-profit institutions to participate in the agreements altogether. On October 24-25, 2023 the NC-SARA board of directors\napproved five policy modifications, none of which permitted states to apply more stringent standards to for-profit institutions or\nexclude for-profit institutions from NC-SARA participation. Nonetheless, the process demonstrates the possibility that the adoption of\ncertain NC-SARA proposals in the future, including the earlier proposal to alter standards or to eliminate the ability of for-profit\ninstitutions to participate in the agreements, could have a material adverse effect on Capella University, Strayer University, and the\nCompany.\nOn January 16, 2024, NC-SARA initiated its 2024 policy manual modification process with a call for proposals for SARA policy\nchanges. The call for proposals ended February 2, 2024 and yielded 50 proposed changes to NC-SARA policies, some of which, if\nadopted, could significantly alter the distance education reciprocity agreements. Such proposals include that an institution may be\ndenied participation in SARA if it violates any requirement related to state authorization, accreditation, or participation in federal Title\nIV financial aid programs; and that an institution may be denied participation in SARA or have its participation limited as a result of\nadverse actions against it related to the institution’s academic quality, financial stability, or student consumer protection issues. On April\n26, 2024, NC-SARA held its public comment forum to seek input on these potential changes. In addition to the public comment forum,\nNC-SARA accepted written comments between April 15, 2024 and May 17, 2024. On September 10, 2024, NC-SARA announced that\nthe four regional compacts/regional steering committees approved 10 policy change proposals, which include proposed changes related\nto when an institution may be placed on provisional status and when a state must deny or may exercise its discretion to deny an\ninstitution’s participation in SARA. The NC-SARA board of directors approved the proposals on October 23-25, 2024, concluding the\n2024 policy modification process. The adoption of certain proposals, including those described above to the extent they affect the\nability of institutions to participate in the agreements, could have a material adverse effect on Capella University, Strayer University,\nand the Company. For example, if excluded from the ability to participate in the agreements, Capella University and Strayer University\nwould need to seek authorization in each state, which would increase costs and present the risk that certain jurisdictions would decline\nauthorization.\nPursuant to new U.S. Department of Education regulations, beginning July 1, 2024, in each state where an institution is located,\nstudents enrolled by the institution are located, or students attest that they intend to seek employment, the institution must determine\nthat each program eligible for Title IV: (i) is programmatically accredited if the state or a Federal agency requires such accreditation,\nincluding as a condition for employment in the occupation for which the program prepares the student and (ii) satisfies the applicable\neducational requirements for professional licensure or certification requirements in the state so that a student who enrolls in the\nprogram, and seeks employment in that state after completing the program, qualifies to take any licensure or certification exam that is\nneeded for the student to practice or find employment in an occupation that the program prepares students to enter; and (iii) complies\nwith all state laws related to closure, including record retention, teach-out plans or agreements, and tuition recovery funds or surety\nbonds. Institutions may not enroll for Title IV purposes a student located in a state in which the program does not meet such\nrequirements, unless at the time of initial enrollment the student attests their intent to seek employment in another state that would\nsatisfy such requirements.\nBeginning in January 2024, the Department convened a negotiated rulemaking committee to consider new proposed regulations on,\namong other things, state authorization and state authorization reciprocity agreements. Negotiated rulemaking committee meetings\nconcluded in March 2024 with no consensus reached on the topics. In the absence of consensus, the Department of Education has\ndiscretion to propose a rule for public comment. We cannot predict whether the Department of Education will promulgate any\nregulations that would negatively affect Capella University or Strayer University.\n(cid:0)2 (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q (cid:0)R (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I (cid:0)X (cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H (cid:0)I (cid:0)I (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:17)\nOur ability to grow enrollment depends on a number of factors, including macroeconomic factors like unemployment and the resulting\nlower confidence in job prospects, and many of the regulatory risks discussed above. Our enrollment will be affected by legislative\nuncertainty and regulatory activity in the U.S. and Australia, and macroeconomic conditions globally. It is likely that legislative,\nregulatory, and economic uncertainties will continue for the foreseeable future, and thus it is difficult to assess our long-term growth\nprospects. Since 2013, we have selectively closed physical locations of Strayer University to align our resources in keeping with the\nincreasing preference of our current students for online course delivery. Although we plan to continue investing selectively in new\ncampus facilities, and to pursue other growth opportunities in the future, there can be no assurance as to what our growth rate will be or\nas to the steps we may need to take to adapt to the changing regulatory, legislative, and economic conditions.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOn May 16, 2024, the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024, which would amend the\nEducation Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, was introduced into the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament. On\nAugust 15, 2024, the Bill was introduced into the Senate of the Australian Parliament. The Bill contains several measures that would\nauthorize the Minister for Education to regulate the provision of education to overseas students, including, among other things, by\nlimiting the enrollments of overseas students by provider. These limits would apply to Torrens University and to Think Education. The\nCompany is unable to predict the final specific limits or their effect at this time. Limitations on the number of enrollments of oversees\nstudents could materially and adversely affect our business.\n(cid:0), (cid:0)I (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)6 (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)I (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)S (cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)Z (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)H (cid:0)[ (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)J (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)J (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)T (cid:0)X (cid:0)L(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)I (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)K (cid:0)L(cid:0)J (cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U\n(cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)X (cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)I (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)J (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)I (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)P (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)I (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)I (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)O\n(cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)L(cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)X (cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17)\nAs providers of higher education, Capella University and Strayer University are subject to extensive laws and regulation on both the\nfederal and state levels and by accrediting agencies. In particular, the Higher Education Act and related regulations subject Capella\nUniversity, Strayer University, and all other higher education institutions that participate in the various Title IV programs to significant\nregulatory scrutiny.\nThe Higher Education Act mandates specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following components of the higher education\nregulatory triad: (1) the federal government through the Department of Education; (2) the accrediting agencies recognized by the\nSecretary of Education; and (3) state education regulatory bodies.\nIn addition, other federal agencies such as the CFPB, Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and Federal Communications Commission\nand various state agencies and state attorneys general enforce consumer protection, calling and texting, marketing, privacy and data\nsecurity, and other laws applicable to post-secondary educational institutions. Findings of noncompliance could result in monetary\ndamages, fines, penalties, injunctions, or restrictions or obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Some of\nthese laws also include private rights of action.\nOn October 8, 2021, the Department of Education announced establishment of an Office of Enforcement within the Department’s\nOffice of Federal Student Aid, designed to strengthen oversight over and enforcement against post-secondary schools that participate in\nfederal student loan, grant, and work-study programs. The Office of Enforcement restores an office first established by the Department\nin 2016. The Department announced the Office of Enforcement would comprise four existing divisions: Administrative Actions and\nAppeals Services Group, Borrower Defense Group, Investigations Group, and Resolution and Referral Management Group. The\nDepartment intends the Office of Enforcement to coordinate with other state and federal partners, including the U.S. Department of\nJustice, CFPB, FTC, state attorneys general, and other state and federal partners.\nOn October 6, 2021, the FTC announced that it is resurrecting Penalty Offense Authority under Section 5(m) of the FTC Act (the\n“Act”). Under the Act, the FTC may secure penalties against entities not a party to an original proceeding if the FTC can show that the\nentity had actual knowledge that the conduct in question was found to be unfair or deceptive. In an effort to establish actual knowledge\nand create a pathway for penalties in the event of post-notice acts or practices, the FTC issued that same day an informational notice to\nthe 70 largest for-profit schools based on enrollment and revenues. The notice included a list of acts and practices that the FTC has\ndetermined are unfair or deceptive, including but not limited to acts relating to misrepresentation of employment opportunities and\nother benefits, together with citation to various prior determinations from cases previously litigated by the FTC. Capella University and\nStrayer University received the FTC’s notice on October 7, 2021, although the FTC made clear that receipt of the notice itself does not\nreflect any assessment by the FTC as to whether Capella University or Strayer University has engaged in deceptive or unfair conduct.\nOn April 4, 2022, the Company received correspondence from the CFPB, in which the CFPB took the position that it has supervisory\nauthority over the Company as a covered person that offers or provides private education loans pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1)(D)\nand further indicated the CFPB is considering whether to cite violations based on preliminary findings that the Company may have\nviolated the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. 5301 et seq., due to alleged student loan\nservicing and collections practices or policies. Specifically, the CFPB referred to Capella University and Strayer University’s historical\npractice of withholding official transcripts from students who were delinquent in paying amounts due, a practice which both\nuniversities discontinued prior to receipt of the correspondence. While the Company disagrees with CFPB’s position as to its\nsupervisory authority and disputes any alleged legal or regulatory violations, the Company cooperated with CFPB’s inquiry and\nresponded to CFPB as requested on April 25, 2022. The CFPB subsequently sent a letter on July 8, 2022, indicating that it believed the\nwithholding of transcripts was a violation, and requiring the Company to cease withholding transcripts for those with an outstanding\nbalance and to take other remedial actions. The Company had already discontinued its historical practice prior to the CFPB’s notice,\nand informed the CFPB that it completed the remedial actions in the allotted 30 days. On April 26, 2022, the CFPB informed the\nCompany that it intended to conduct an announced education loan exam in June\n44\nTable of Contents\n2022. The examination started on June 13, 2022 and fieldwork concluded on August 5, 2022. On September 12, 2022, the CFPB\ninformed the Company of a preliminary finding related to a product that is no longer utilized, and invited the Company’s response. The\nCompany timely responded to the CFPB’s letter, disagreeing with the preliminary finding and noting that the product to which it related\nis no longer utilized. On November 29, 2022, the CFPB informed the Company that, within 90 days, it should remediate the finding for\nany impacted students, and it also identified areas for the Company to address to ensure regulatory compliance. The Company took\nremedial action and responded to the CFPB within the 90-day deadline. On December 15, 2023, the Company provided answers to\nquestions from the CFPB in the first of two annual telephone conversations as part of the CFPB’s periodic monitoring practice. On\nOctober 25, 2024, CFPB notified the Company that it would be conducting a review of the Company’s remediation efforts and, upon\ncompletion, will determine whether it will close the 2022 exam.\nThe laws, regulations, standards, and policies applicable to our business frequently change, and changes in, or new interpretations of,\napplicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in\nvarious states, permissible activities, ability to communicate with prospective students, receipt of funds under Title IV programs, or\ncosts of doing business. The Department of Education periodically engages in negotiated rulemaking sessions to revise regulations that\ngovern the federal Title IV student financial aid programs. Certain proposals or new rules related to these issues could raise the cost of\ncompliance for Capella University or Strayer University or require changes in the educational programs offered by Capella University\nand Strayer University. We cannot predict whether the Department of Education will promulgate any regulations that would negatively\naffect Capella University or Strayer University.\nTitle IV requirements are enforced by the Department of Education and, in some instances, by private plaintiffs or other third parties. If\nCapella University and Strayer University are found not to be in compliance with these laws, regulations, standards, or policies, they\ncould lose access to Title IV program funds and face related monetary liability, which would have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid $5.0 million to repurchase shares of common stock under its\nrepurchase program.

We discuss management's\nreasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below, and our publicly available financial information reconciles\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we reference. Although management\nevaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these\nnon-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, total\ncosts and expenses, income from operations, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income, earnings\nper share or any other comparable financial measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, we may calculate and/or\npresent these non-GAAP financial measures differently than measures with the same or similar names that other\ncompanies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by\nothers.\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate financial performance because those non-GAAP\nmeasures allow for period-over-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operations before the impact of\ncertain items described below. Management believes this information is useful to investors to compare the\nCompany’s results of operations period-over-period. These measures are Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs\nand Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income\nTaxes, Adjusted Net Income, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted\nEBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS). We define Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Total Costs and\nExpenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes,\nAdjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to exclude (1) amortization and depreciation expense related to\nintangible assets and software assets associated with the Company’s acquisition of Torrens University and\nassociated assets in Australia and New Zealand, (2) integration expenses associated with the Company’s merger\nwith Capella Education Company and the Company’s acquisition of Torrens University and associated assets in\nAustralia and New Zealand, (3) severance costs, asset impairment charges, gains on sale of real estate and early\ntermination of leased facilities, and other costs associated with the Company’s restructuring activities, (4) income/\nloss recognized from the Company’s investments in partnership interests and other investments, and (5) discrete\ntax adjustments utilizing adjusted effective income tax rates of 30.0% and 29.5% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. To illustrate currency impacts to operating results, Adjusted Revenue,\nAdjusted Total Costs and Expenses, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted\nIncome Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 are also presented on a constant currency basis utilizing an exchange rate of 0.65 Australian\nDollars to U.S. Dollars, which was the average exchange rate for the same period in 2023. We define EBITDA as\nnet income before other income, the provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and from this\namount in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA we also exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense\nassociated with deferred implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements, and the amounts in (2)\nand (3) above. Please see the press release filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the 8-K dated November 7, 2024 and available\non our website at www.strategiceducation.com and our Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures\nto the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes for\nGAAP measures.\nNovember 7, 2024 6\nQ3 2024 Results\nNovember 7, 2024"

          "content": "2023 ANNUAL REPORT\nStrategic Education, Inc.\nLetter to Shareholders 2023\nDear Fellow Shareholders,\nPut simply, it was a very good year. In 2023 Strategic Education, Inc. (SEI) generated $1.13 billion in revenue,\n$125 million in adjusted operating income, $89 million in adjusted net income, and $3.72 in adjusted earnings\nper share. During the year we performed well on all of our financial metrics, as our revenue increased 6%, our\nexpenses only increased 3%, and our earnings increased by roughly 47% vs 2022’s results. We educated over\n100,000 students at our three Universities in 2023, an increase of 5%, and served an additional 120,000 students\nthrough our Education Technology Services segment, an increase of 50%. Additionally, during 2023 our three\nUniversities graduated 28,000 students with bachelor’s, masters’ or doctoral degrees, an increase of 5%. That\nlast statistic is, in my view, the most meaningful accomplishment of the year for SEI shareholders, as the\nacademic successes of our students are the only true generators of sustainable long-term returns on our invested\ncapital.\nIn this letter I will discuss our company’s academic, operational, and financial results for 2023, including the\nspecific performance of our three business units: US Higher Education, Australia/New Zealand, and Education\nTechnology Services. I will also share our company’s objectives for 2024. Finally, as is our custom, I have\nincluded as an appendix to this letter both an excerpt from Strayer University’s 1912 student catalog, as well\nas an excerpt from my first letter to shareholders written in early 2001. These two excerpts have been reprinted\nin each of our company’s annual reports since 2001. While our enterprise is now admittedly much larger than\njust Strayer University, I believe both excerpts remain helpful in understanding SEI’s culture, operating model,\nand most importantly, our immutable priorities.\n2023 SEGMENT RESULTS\nUS Higher Education\nAs shareholders of SEI, we are very fortunate to be the stewards of two of the finest universities serving\nworking adults in the United States: Strayer University, a 131-year-old institution serving mostly\nundergraduate students; and Capella University, a 31-year-old institution serving mostly graduate students.\nStrayer operates through an extensive physical campus network as well as online, while Capella operates solely\nonline. These two Universities educated 82,000 students in 2023, up from 77,000 in 2022. Enrollment at\nCapella University grew 8% to approximately 45,000 students during the year, while enrollment at Strayer\nUniversity grew 5% to approximately 37,000 students. Our US Higher Education segment generated $819\nmillion in revenue in 2023 (up from $770 million in 2022), and contributed $60 million in adjusted operating\nearnings (up from $38 million in 2022).\nIn 2023, Capella and Strayer both enjoyed strong inflows of new students (in excess of 10% growth versus the\nprior year), as well as high and relatively stable continuation rates of previously enrolled students. These\nenrollment results were supported at the macro level by strong employment confidence and rising labor force\nparticipation rates in the U.S., which increased demand for post-secondary education among our target working\nadult population. In addition, innovations in academic content and delivery at Capella and Strayer made both\nUniversities destinations of choice for working adults returning to school for a post-secondary degree during\nthe year.\nBoth Capella and Strayer also benefited in 2023 from the efforts of our Education Technology Services\nsegment driving increased employer sponsored student enrollment. I will discuss the Education Technology\nServices segment results in more detail later in this letter, but suffice it to say that our focus on meeting the\neducational needs of corporations and other large employers was a significant source of enrollment growth at\nboth Capella and Strayer Universities during the year. In fact, in 2023 the share of employer sponsored students\n1\nas a percentage of total student enrollment rose from 33% to 35% at Capella, and rose from 16% to 18% at\nStrayer.\nOne innovative example of SEI’s ability to serve the needs of employers in educating their workforce is the\npartnership Capella University developed in 2023 with United HealthGroup, Inc. (NYSE: UNH). United\nHealthGroup, which through its subsidiary Optum operates one of the largest health delivery systems in the\nU.S., was experiencing a problem common in the health care industry – a severe shortage of skilled nurses.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are currently more than 200,000 unfilled nursing\npositions in the United States, and that shortfall is expected to persist annually through the remainder of this\ndecade. Traditional nursing schools cannot keep up with this demand, as more than 90,000 qualified students\nare turned away each year from nursing programs in the U.S. due to a shortage of faculty, classrooms, and\nmost significantly, clinical training space.\nRecognizing this issue, in 2023 Optum and Capella structured an innovative solution in the form of a new\neducational joint program for nurses, where Capella University provides the online nursing instruction, and\nOptum provides the clinical training space and potential employment opportunities. This collaboration pairs\nCapella’s unique educational capabilities with Optum’s clinical expertise and sites of care. We started teaching\nclasses in this program in the Fall semester of 2023, and are now offering two nursing degrees which are both\nin high demand in Optum’s system: Family Nurse Practitioner and Adult Gerontology Primary Care. We are\nvery excited about the opportunity to partner with a leading healthcare provider (and employer) in helping\nmeet this important societal need. We look forward to reporting on the program’s results in the future.\nIn summary, our US Higher Education segment performed very well in 2023. More importantly, the strong\nacademic outcomes, high continuation rates, healthy new student intakes, and innovative corporate solutions\nwe accomplished during the year will likely drive increased enrollment, revenue, and earnings contributions\nfrom our U.S. Higher Education segment in 2024 and beyond.\nAustralia / New Zealand\nTorrens University, Media Design School, and Think Education, collectively our Australia and New Zealand\nsegment, educated nearly 19,000 students in 2023, roughly equal to the previous year. The segment delivered\nstrong financial results, with increases in both revenue and operating income contribution compared to 2022.\nWhile the number of students we educated in 2023 at Torrens University did not increase from the prior year,\nthe average number of courses each student took during the year did increase, which led to an increase in our\nrevenue collected per student. Even with a 4% decline in the Australian Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate, the\nsegment grew its revenue 1% to US$234 million in 2023. That revenue growth, combined with effective\nexpense management, led to an operating income contribution of US$36m in 2023, which was a significant\n18% increase over the prior year.\nOne unique aspect of the higher education system in Australia is that the National Government annually\nsurveys and measures the academic quality of all 43 accredited universities in the country. In 2023, Torrens\nUniversity, the only investor-funded institution of the 43, was ranked 7th in quality of teaching and student\nsatisfaction. We are very proud of our Torrens University faculty, administrators, and staff for this well-\ndeserved recognition, and are confident that they will maintain their commitment to academic quality as\nTorrens University grows in the years to come.\nEducation Technology Services\nThe Education Technology Services segment is the fastest growing and most profitable part of our enterprise.\nIt contains all of our non-university operations, but the segment is also crucial to the performance of our three\nUniversities as well. The segment consists of two assets: Workforce Edge, a business which structures and\n2\nmanages employer–university partnerships for universities (both our own as well as for a broader group of\npartner universities); and Sophia, our self-paced online academic streaming service.\nWorkforce Edge earns a fee from universities for helping those universities attract students whose tuition is\npaid by the employers of those students. Employer sponsored students have always been a major component\nof the student bodies at both Capella and Strayer Universities, and will increasingly be so at Torrens University.\nEmployer sponsored students help our academic institutions in several ways. First, with the employer paying\nfor some or all of the employees’ tuition, these students incur less debt to finance their education. This is very\nimportant to SEI’s objective of not just lowering the level of our tuition, but also lowering the amount of debt\nour students are left to service after they graduate. Second, employer sponsored students have historically\nperformed better in our classrooms than non-sponsored students. And finally, for our U.S. institutions,\nemployer sponsored students reduce the overall percentage of our tuition revenue which comes from the\nproceeds of U.S. federally issued Title IV student loans. Since that percentage is limited by federal law and\nregulation to no more than 90%, it is a very important metric we track to ensure continued access to Title IV\nfederal loans for those of our students who rely on that source of funding.\nSophia consists of a catalog of over 60 self-paced online courses. Students can access all these courses for a\nsubscription price of $99 per month. The courses cover mostly 100 level general education topics and are\ndesigned to replace the large first year survey courses offered at traditional universities. While Sophia courses\nare not led by faculty, they are designed and graded by subject matter experts and university professors. All\nSophia courses have been recommended by the American Council on Education for transfer credit to accredited\nuniversities. Indeed, Sophia has entered into articulation agreements with nearly 70 U.S. universities which\nhave agreed to accept Sophia credits for transfer. In just two years of operations, Sophia has grown from zero\nto over 100,000 discrete paying users in 2023.\nSophia is a successful EdTech business in its own right, but more importantly, it also allows SEI to bundle\nSophia’s very low-cost courses with Capella, Strayer, and Torrens degree programs, offering even more cost\neffective educational solutions to both students and employers. Sophia and Workforce Edge are similar in size\nand profitability, and in 2023 they combined to grow the Education Technology Services segment revenue\n26% to $80 million, and to grow its operating income contribution 50% to $29 million. We are very excited\nabout this segment’s financial contributions in the future, both on its own, and as a key driver of growth for\nCapella, Strayer, and Torrens Universities.\n2023 CAPITAL ALLOCATION\nSEI began 2023 with $236 million of cash and marketable securities, $101 million of debt drawn on our bank\nrevolver (associated with the purchase of our ANZ assets in 2020) and 23.9 million shares outstanding. During\n2023 SEI generated $159 million of pre-tax cash from operations. We also sold one of our campus properties\nfor $6 million in proceeds. During 2023 we used that cash as follows. First, we paid $42 million in local, state,\nfederal, and international taxes. Next, we invested $37 million in capital expenditures.\nThis left us with $86 million in owners’ distributable cash flow. We returned approximately $74 million to\nshareholders in 2023 through our $2.40 per share annual common dividend, combined with our repurchase of\n$15 million of our common stock at an average price of $77.50 per share. In addition, we paid down $40\nmillion of our debt. This left us at year end 2023 with $208 million of cash and marketable securities on our\nbalance sheet, $61 million of debt in the form of the remaining draw on our bank revolver, and 24 million\nshares outstanding.\nAs a board, our capital allocation priorities in 2024 will be to: first, fully fund our academic institutions and\n In 2023 our effective cash tax rate rose to 35% vs the roughly 28% we paid in the last couple of years. This increase was the result of our having\nbenefitted in 2021 and 2022 from net operating loss carry forwards generated in the Australia/New Zealand segment before our acquisition of that\nbusiness in 2020. In 2023 our growing cumulative earnings from that segment exhausted those carry forwards.\n3\ntheir various growth opportunities; second, strengthen our balance sheet in order to return our US Department\nof Education financial composite score to the highest possible level of 3.0; and third, prudently return any\nexcess distributable cash to our owners, first with a common dividend, and then, if conditions are appropriate,\nwith opportunistic share repurchases. We always weigh all uses of capital against the standard of what will\ncreate the highest long-term increase in the per share value of our enterprise.\nCONCLUSION\n2023 was the first year since 2019 that we grew SEI’s financial results. On behalf of our entire Board of\nDirectors, I want to thank you for both your confidence and your patience. Clearly, the Covid disruptions of\n2020 and 2021 had a negative multiyear impact on our operations. However, I am pleased to report that the\nstorm has passed. With credit to Walt Whitman, our “ship has weather’ ed every rack, the prize we sought is\nwon.” To be clear, in our minds that prize is the delivery of the highest quality education, with rigorous\nacademic standards, and successful student outcomes, at all of our platforms.\nThe beauty of SEI’s business model is that by focusing on that prize, we believe we can deliver long-term,\nsustainable, healthy financial returns for our investors. In fact, over the next several years, we believe that with\nonly modest growth in our student enrollment (growth which is entirely consistent with our commitment to\nmaintaining academic quality), we should compound our net income and earnings per share in excess of 20%\nper annum.\nHowever, it must be stressed that the financial returns we enjoy as SEI shareholders exist only because of the\nreturns our students receive on the investments they make with us (in terms of both money and time) to achieve\ntheir education. Our working adult students can choose to go anywhere, or nowhere, to pursue their post-\nsecondary degrees. In order to be relevant over the long-term, our academic offerings have to be effective in\nteaching our students the knowledge and skills to better their lives. And we must always offer those academic\nprograms at prices which are commensurate with their value. We are fortunate as shareholders to own assets\nwhich have passed that test at scale over decades.\nFinally, on behalf of your entire Board of Directors, I would like to once again thank you for the opportunity\nto have been the stewards of your invested capital over the last year. Karl, Dan, and I look forward to speaking\nwith all of you during 2024, and are always available (except during quiet periods) to answer any questions\nyou may have about our enterprise. More importantly, if you have the time I would urge you to personally see\nthe fruits of your invested capital by attending one of our three Universities’ graduation ceremonies in 2024.\nInformation on these events can be found on our website www.strategiceducation.com. Nothing provides better\ncontext for what we do, and why we do it, than watching our students achieve goals they never thought\npossible.\nSincerely yours,\nRobert S. Silberman\nChairman of the Board\n4\nOUR HERITAGE\nReprinted from the Strayer Business College\n1912 student catalog\nThis catalog was written with a view of setting before the men and women of this community some of the\nadvantages of a business education, and of acquainting them with the superior facilities of this school for giving\nhigh-grade business training.\nThe courses have been designed and presented to meet the needs of the business office of today. The teachers\nare men and women who are specialists in their respective subjects. The school rooms have been chosen and\nequipped with special reference to light, comfort and sanitation, so as to make it an ideal place for study.\nWe ask that the public, in determining which school it shall attend, to consider the facts in connection\nwith this school, as are outlined in this catalog and supplementary literature. It is twenty years old. It has\ngrown steadily since the beginning. It attributes its growth to correct ideals, careful management and successful,\nenthusiastic, and rapidly increasing alumni.\nWhile it is essential to its success that a school should give thorough instruction in the subjects that comprise\nits courses, yet the school that does only this, falls short of its full mission. The development of those traits of\ncharacter which make for reliability in business and good citizenship are the peculiar province of the school as\nwell as the home. This school, then, has nothing in common, can have nothing in common, with those so-called\nbusiness schools offering cheap and superficial courses. Such courses, while inexpensive, and possibly of short\nduration, cannot result in anything but disappointment in the end.\nThis school, then, stands for high ideals, it courts investigation, welcomes comparison, and stands\nby its promises. It is a school to which you may attend with the knowledge that you will be in pleasant\nsurroundings, will be accorded fair treatment, and will be given thorough and painstaking instruction.\nFinally, in presenting this catalog, we want to thank a discerning public for its support, and assure it that\nwe shall endeavor to continue to merit the bountiful confidence it has heretofore placed in us.\nStrayer BuSineSS College\nCirCa 1912\nOUR BUSINESS MODEL\nReprinted from SEI’s\n2001 Letter to Shareholders\nStrayer Education, Inc. is an education services Two of the attractive attributes of our business are that\nholding company whose primary asset is Strayer it generates significant after-tax free cash flow from\nUniversity, a 110 year old institution of higher operations, and that it has a high return on invested\nlearning focused on educating working adults.
