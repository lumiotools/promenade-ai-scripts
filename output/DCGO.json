(Nasdaq: DCGO) (“DocGo” or the “Company”), a leading provider of technology-enabled mobile health services, today announced financial and operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $138.7 million, compared to $186.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 26%. The decline was primarily due to the planned wind down of migrant-related programs. For the first nine months of 2024, total revenue was $495.7 million, compared to $425.0 for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 17%. \n  * GAAP gross margin (which includes non-cash depreciation expenses) for the third quarter of 2024 was 33.0%, compared to 27.2% in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Adjusted gross margin1 for the third quarter of 2024 was 36.0%, compared to 29.5% in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Net income was $4.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 2%. For the first nine months of 2024, net income was $21.0 million, a substantial increase compared to $2.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 was $17.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $16.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 7%. For the first nine months of 2024, adjusted EBITDA1 was $59.2 million, compared to $31.5 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 88%. \n  * Mobile Health Services revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $90.7 million, compared to $139.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 35%. For the first nine months of 2024, Mobile Health Services revenue was $351.3 million, compared to $292.3 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 20%. \n  * Transportation Services revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $48 million, compared to $47.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 2%. For the first nine months of 2024, Transportation Services revenue was $144.4 million, compared to $132.7 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 9%. \n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company held total cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of approximately $108.5 million, compared to $85.8 million as of June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\n  * Full-year 2024 revenue guidance range has been tightened to $620-$630 million, compared to the previous estimate of $600-$650 million. \n  * Full-year 2024 adjusted EBITDA2 is now expected to be $70-$75 million, compared to the previous estimate of $65-$75 million. \n  * Full-year 2024 cash flow from operations is being increased to $90-$100 million, compared to the previous estimate of $80-$90 million. \n\n\n\n**2025 Guidance**\n\n  * Full-year 2025 revenue is expected to be $410-$450 million. \n  * Full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin2 is expected to be in a range of 8%-10% of total revenue. \n\n\n\n**Select Corporate Highlights for the Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Weeks**\n\n  * For the second consecutive quarter, the Company more than doubled the number of patients assigned by its insurance partners for care gap closure services when compared to the end of the prior quarter, and is now in excess of 500,000. \n  * Significantly expanded the Company’s geographic footprint across the west coast in support of its care gap closure programs, which will enhance healthcare access for hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients in California. \n  * Driven by demonstrating an over 50% reduction in ED admissions for L.A. Care - a major California payer with 2.5 million members - the Company signed a contract expansion to extend its transitional care services, add care gap closure services, and help manage some of the payer’s most complex, high-risk member population. \n  * Healthcare visionary Dr. Stephen K. Klasko joined the Board of Directors as Chair. Dr. Klasko was previously CEO of Jefferson Health. \n  * Secured $4 million contract extension to continue providing vital 911 basic life support services for Atlantic City, New Jersey. \n  * Launched Well Child Visits program with a major payer to help eliminate barriers to pediatric preventive care and advance health equity for children & families. \n  * In Dover, Delaware, launched 911 emergency medical services and renewed our partnership with Bayhealth to provide non-emergency medical transportation services for another three years. \n  * Signed a new contract to facilitate in-home medical services for members of Firefly Health, an employer-focused health plan provider. \n\n\n\nLee Bienstock, Chief Executive Officer of DocGo, commented, “Our business continues to perform well across all customer verticals. We are seeing especially strong demand for our care gap closure programs with substantial increases in all leading indicators as well as doubling the average weekly number of care gap visits completed when compared to our average weekly run rate from last quarter. We are rapidly building out the infrastructure to support continued growth in these programs across California and in the Northeast as well.” \n\nNorm Rosenberg, Chief Financial Officer of DocGo, also commented, “We continued to see a significant increase in our cash balance and generated over $31 million in cash flow from operations during the period. Throughout 2023 and early 2024, we had a considerable working capital outlay to support our migrant related programs. As these programs wind down, we are seeing that trend reverse and are recognizing strong cash flow as a result which should continue over the coming quarters. Our strong balance sheet gives us the ability to support our growth initiatives, make additional share repurchases, fund new strategic relationships and repay our line of credit.” \n\n  1. Adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. \n  2. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We have not reconciled adjusted EBITDA outlook or adjusted EBITDA margin outlook to the most comparable GAAP outlooks because it is not possible to do so without unreasonable efforts due to the uncertainty and potential variability of reconciling items, which are dependent on future events and often outside of management’s control and which could be significant. Because such items cannot be reasonably predicted with the level of precision required, we are unable to provide an outlook for the comparable GAAP measure (net income and net margin). Forward-looking estimates of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are made in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted herein. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details**\n\nThursday, November 7, 2024 at 5:00 PM ET\n\n1-800-717-1738 – Investors Dial\n\n1-646-307-1865 – Int’l Investors Dial\n\nConference ID: DocGo\n\nWebcast: [https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1691564&tp_key=1abd83f022](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fviavid.webcasts.com%2Fstarthere.jsp%3Fei%3D1691564%26tp_key%3D1abd83f022&esheet=54149099&newsitemid=20241107669990&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fviavid.webcasts.com%2Fstarthere.jsp%3Fei%3D1691564%26amp%3Btp_key%3D1abd83f022&index=1&md5=7e7453b1658fc99cad9e1595fbd3284b)\n\nThe webcast can also be accessed under Events on the Investors section of the Company’s website, [https://ir.docgo.com/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.docgo.com%2F&esheet=54149099&newsitemid=20241107669990&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fir.docgo.com%2F&index=2&md5=30eac1bd6e7d334d778f9a187ebd61a6). \n\n**About DocGo**\n\nDocGo is leading the proactive healthcare revolution with an innovative care delivery platform that includes mobile health services, remote patient monitoring and ambulance services.

\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe following information provides definitions and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company has provided this non-GAAP financial information, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in this earnings release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\n**_Adjusted Gross Margin_**\n\nAdjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are considered non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules because they exclude certain amounts included in gross profit and gross margin calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted gross profit is total revenue minus cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization (which are shown separately), and adjusted gross margin is adjusted gross profit as a percentage of total revenue. \n\nThe Company’s management believes that adjusted gross margin is useful in evaluating DocGo’s operating performance, as the calculation of this measure excludes the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges. The Company’s management believes that by using adjusted gross margin in conjunction with GAAP gross margin, investors will get a more complete view of what management considers to be the Company’s core operating performance and allow for comparison of this measure when compared to those of prior periods. While many companies use adjusted gross margin as a performance measure, not all companies use identical calculations for determining adjusted gross margin. As such, DocGo’s presentation of adjusted gross margin might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. \n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC rules because it excludes certain amounts included in net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, adjusted EBITDA is arrived at by taking reported GAAP net income and adding back the following items: net interest expense (income), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other (income) expense, non-cash equity-based compensation and certain other non-recurring expenses consisting of certain one-time legal settlements and certain one-time expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and other corporate activities, beyond those that are typically incurred. \n\nThe Company’s management believes that its adjusted EBITDA measure is useful in evaluating DocGo’s operating performance, as the calculation of this measure generally eliminates the effect of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, as well as other items of a non-recurring and/or non-cash nature. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of GAAP cash flow, as this measure does not consider certain cash-based expenses, such as payments for taxes or debt service. \n\nManagement believes that using adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP measures such as net income assists investors in getting a more complete picture of the Company’s financial results and operations, affording them with a more complete view of what management considers to be the Company’s core operating performance as well as offering the ability to assess such performance as compared with that of prior periods and management’s public guidance. While many companies use adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure, not all companies use identical calculations for determining adjusted EBITDA. As such, DocGo’s presentation of adjusted EBITDA might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. \n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is considered a non-GAAP measure under SEC rules. It is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenues. Management believes using adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures, such as gross margin and/or net margin, is useful to investors because it assists investors in getting a more complete view of what management considers the Company’s core operating performance, as expressed in marginal terms. While many companies use adjusted EBITDA margin as a performance measure, not all companies use identical calculations for determining adjusted EBITDA margin. As such, DocGo’s presentation of adjusted EBITDA margin might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. \n\n**_Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures_**\n\nThe table below reflects the reconciliation of GAAP gross margin and adjusted gross margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023: \n\nQ3 | YTD (Sept)  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRevenue |  $  |  138,684,814  |  $  |  186,552,910  |  $  |  495,722,059  |  $  |  425,042,373   \nCost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization, which are shown separately below) |  (88,764,282  |  )  |  (131,502,046  |  )  |  (322,645,933  |  )  |  (296,346,420  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization |  (4,177,534 |  ) |  (4,336,267 |  ) |  (12,561,973 |  ) |  (11,816,657 |  )  \nGAAP gross profit |  45,742,998  |  50,714,597  |  160,514,153  |  116,879,296   \nDepreciation and amortization |  4,177,534 |  4,336,267 |  12,561,973 |  11,816,657  \nAdjusted gross profit |  49,920,532  |  55,050,864  |  173,076,126  |  128,695,953   \nGAAP gross margin |  33.0  |  %  |  27.2  |  %  |  32.4  |  %  |  27.5  |  %   \nAdjusted gross margin |  36.0  |  %  |  29.5  |  %  |  34.9  |  %  |  30.3  |  %   \n  \nThe table below reflects the reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and the second quarter of 2024 (in millions): \n\nQ3 | YTD | Q2  \n---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024**  \nNet income (GAAP) |  $4.5 |  $4.6 |  $21.0 |  $2.0 |  $5.9  \n(+) Net interest expense (income) |  $0.5 |  ($0.3)  |  $1.4 |  ($1.6)  |  $0.5  \n(+) Income tax |  $4.5 |  $4.5 |  $13.3 |  $2.0 |  $3.7  \n(+) Depreciation & amortization  |  $4.2 |  $4.3 |  $12.6 |  $11.8 |  $4.2  \n(+) Other (income) expense |  $0.6 |  ($0.1)  |  $0.4 |  $1.1 |  $0.0  \n**EBITDA** |  $14.3 |  $13.0 |  $48.7 |  $15.3 |  $14.3  \n(+) Non-cash stock compensation |  $3.2 |  $3.4 |  $9.8 |  $15.2 |  $2.6  \n(+) Non-recurring expense |  $0.4 |  $0.3 |  $0.7 |  $1.0 |  $0.3  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $17.9 |  $16.7 |  $59.2 |  $31.5 |  $17.2  \nTotal revenue |  $138.7 |  $186.6 |  $495.1 |  $238.5 |  $192.1  \nPretax income margin |  6.5%  |  4.9%  |  6.9%  |  1.7%  |  5.0%   \nNet margin |  3.2%  |  2.5%  |  4.2%  |  0.8%  |  3.1%   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin |  12.9%  |  8.9%  |  12.0%  |  13.2%  |  9.0%   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241107669990r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241107669990/en/>\n\n**Investors:** Mike Cole DocGo 949-444-1341 mike.cole@docgo.com ir@docgo.com\n\n**Media:** Tommy Meara Moxie Strategies 718-309-3506 tommy@moxiestrategies.com\n\nSource: DocGo Inc.\n\n[](# \"Back to top\")\n"
