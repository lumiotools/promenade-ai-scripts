The Company anticipates that topline results will be available in December 2024.\n\n“We would like to extend our appreciation to the patients and caregivers who participated in our study, without whom we would not have been able to accomplish this goal. In addition, we would like to thank our investigators, our partners at the National Institute of Aging and the Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) and the greater [DLB awareness community](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q1EP4db9mun_wJuUICh_C_doIFKcBGgxxBOEt9eIBLlTykFr-IsTZ1faqtWZuENVv_aaRUnYmFO8HLhJeSRP58xQvCR8-hgaLwowu082Burb_-_qVbGEYV-r_SIAJpY- \"DLB awareness community\") for their tireless commitment,” stated [Anthony Caggiano, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=97USD7uMK6_H2uIJ3Yz-7gpjULp9X6svGC982TkLz8kO0kCQI7ajzgr4B0ykGHFyS0kA2homnx8sQ45tY9EO597qF7EP0Vfzvipze1XhLamARsc4zBVoHKrUMJuPPZ_Y \"Anthony Caggiano, M.D., Ph.D.\"), Cognition’s chief medical officer and head of R&D.\n\n[Lisa Ricciardi](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UUDd_ArvNouq3zPydLw3bekmUX5FwWeLSE2uxYwSUKiRHcYpWdJ8WfWs5dPv8NMHuI1Pnt8K0TV1qdpBCBUbyxhI5tc5egqgRLqPTIgEyOhMJsvQieXe4Rpw3zt7YAVa \"Lisa Ricciardi\"), Cognition’s president and CEO, concluded, “We look forward to reviewing the results of this study to enhance our understanding of CT1812’s tolerability profile and identify signals of efficacy across measures of cognition and function.”\n\n**About Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)** Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common cause of dementia, affecting an estimated 1.4 million Americans. The disease is believed to be caused by a buildup of the protein α-synuclein, which aggregates in Lewy bodies, which are found within brain neurons. DLB is referred to as a “whole-body” disease, as it disrupts biological processes affecting autonomic, digestive, cognitive, and motor systems. Varied initial symptoms may include day-to-day fluctuations in alertness level, hallucinations, delusions, movement disorders and REM sleep disorder (acting out dreams while sleeping). Only a few symptomatic treatments for DLB are approved and currently there are no disease-modifying therapeutics.\n\n**About the SHIMMER Study** The [SHIMMER study](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZMqzmUKCogxbejPMVTinyfs5pTXIKppSOWV3quFOnF_ctzi8_B8d842jh-NaBYW0-x6WmfuZi9bODA64hZw1eGNufXFrJNougKf6QsvFiBQ= \"SHIMMER study\") is a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that enrolled 130 adults with mild-to-moderate DLB. Participants were evenly randomized to receive either placebo or one of two oral once-daily doses of CT1812 (100 mg or 300 mg) for six months. Participants are assessed throughout the study using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which track cognitive performance; the Clinician Assessment of Fluctuation (CAF) to measure the frequency and duration of cognitive fluctuations; and the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III, an objective assessment of parkinsonism.\n\nThe SHIMMER study is supported by a grant award from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) totaling approximately $30 million and is being conducted in collaboration with James E. Galvin, MD, MPH, director of the Comprehensive Center for Brain Health at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA). The SHIMMER study is being conducted at over 30 sites in the United States, many of which are LBDA centers of excellence.\n\n**About CT1812** CT1812 is an experimental orally delivered small molecule oligomer antagonist that penetrates the blood-brain barrier and binds selectively to the sigma-2 (σ-2) receptor complex, which is involved in the regulation of key cellular processes. These processes are disrupted by toxic interaction with Aβ or α-synuclein oligomers, oxidative stress and other disease drivers. The ensuing damage to sensitive synapses can progress to a loss of synaptic function, which manifests as cognitive impairment and disease progression. \n\nParticipants are currently being recruited in the START study ([_NCT05531656_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DSkPMNcqF41HhOWBl7TEVCefKYS5jlc3XpL46yK8IQ1oJKbdldgc74tfKifudDvJXnOBfc8ocXllB0OJbGtwjA2tkIJq4a4208y9L1qH47s=)) of CT1812 in adults with early Alzheimer’s disease; and the MAGNIFY study ([_NCT05893537_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DSkPMNcqF41HhOWBl7TEVBy_mCzKNDqGyiLlJyJuzT5Mc78KDXUcId_n90gZETTBIVFa0-n0jZuRkg8QTEz4wWeQEHtRe9jx4riFx7ZcyOo=)) in adults with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration.

This new analysis focused on plasma samples from all participants who entered the study with lower levels of plasma p-tau2172. Several blood-based measures of Alzheimer’s disease biology were identified that were normalized in CT1812-treated participants compared to the placebo-treated participants. These biomarker changes occurred in concert with a 95% slowing of cognitive decline as measured by ADAS-Cog11 in the same patients. These data provide further evidence that CT1812 may be preserving cognitive function and slowing disease progression by protecting key neurological system.\n\nA pre-specified analysis of SHINE participants defined by their baseline plasma p-tau217 concentrations was presented at the [_Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease_ (CTAD)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JKz8dQzkLfo8Xp2hQCUDuawZNmPpgRe0ZfBt7pef4Gu8m36x-cUAIRQf1L3Wl81utPbgWfxsVZM-0lGMmqPdfbVHT4N7h_2AJIKDUMygodvRdOHyPBPWatzpFuQArw6KB7zGEurGhvg9bGHeyJgqbdZoJ7c1WnHAlFfW1-3yqsUuKNDEtKuOdTBj9hODBc8oeeO2WRgU5OcEKxjOt0Q57P-F_jT_uQ8VwgaSPwIvAoo=) conference in October 2024. SHINE participants treated with CT1812 who entered the study with lower plasma p-tau217 experienced a 95% slowing of cognitive decline as measured by ADAS-Cog11 when compared with placebo. This robust clinical benefit represented a 2.7-point improvement on ADAS-Cog11 versus placebo over the six-month study duration.\n\nIn this new analysis, the Company reported changes in plasma biomarkers that may reflect Alzheimer’s disease pathology. The results demonstrated that individuals who entered the study with plasma p-tau217 below the median experienced a normalization of several key indicators of Alzheimer’s disease progression, including:\n\n  * Reduction in the neuroinflammatory biomarker, GFAP, an emerging biomarker of brain injury\n  * Lowering of the neurodegenerative biomarker, NfL, an indicator of the degree of neurodegeneration\n  * Impact on amyloid biology demonstrated by a reduction in Aβ42 and Aβ40, key proteins implicated in Alzheimer’s disease \n\n\n\n“We now have evidence that the dramatic reduction of cognitive decline that was sustained over 6 months in patients treated with CT1812 who had lower plasma p-tau217 levels also was associated with improvements in key indicators of brain cell function. This finding gives us confidence that CT1812 is having a disease-modifying effect,” explained [Anthony O. Caggiano, MD, PhD](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SqngegXmTH1B7VwWSM-AtDMQqKoNv-wrzVNqGIs-0x2tNI5ZpzlWTvJWL0tBfP6yrzbM3EspAs0_-ArvsVRv4ZDZovxHTiNFTnnt2tIbseNUMaZnI0j6SgPavxtR43w7 \"Anthony O.

The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Changes in cognition (ADAS-Cog 11, cognitive composite and MMSE) and function (ADCS-ADL and ADCS-CGIC) were also measured. Participants were evenly randomized to receive either placebo or one of two doses of CT1812 (100 mg or 300 mg), which was taken orally daily for six months. The SHINE study was supported by two grant awards from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) totaling approximately $30 million. More information may be found at clinicaltrials.gov under trial ID [NCT03507790](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=URLaEmi8vW7vxgZOfspgSDrxTT3gXewOasEJiaailVkFOVwSN5RDThLZQzVt4gDxsWt6ymNMUjPD73Sm-jKn3nYBNzFMGDw0xTpDmkShMJo= \"NCT03507790\").\n\n**About p-Tau217 in the SHINE study** Tau is a protein that plays a number of important roles in neurons. When threonine 217, one of the amino acids in tau, is phosphorylated, the protein is referred to as “p-tau217.” P-tau217 is recognized as an important biomarker that has been shown to distinguish Alzheimer’s disease from other neurodegenerative disorders with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nThe SHINE study protocol called for an analysis of cognition and function scores based on plasma p-tau217 levels. All participants entering Cognition Therapeutics’ SHINE study were administered a blood test to measure levels of p-tau217 in their plasma. The median was calculated by taking the mid-point of all plasma p-tau217 levels for SHINE participants. In this study, the median baseline level of plasma p-tau217 was 1.0pg/mL. SHINE participants whose plasma p-tau217 levels were below 1.0pg/mL are referred to as having “lower” levels of plasma p-tau217. Likewise, SHINE participants with plasma p-tau217 concentrations above 1.0pg/mL are referred to as having “higher” levels.\n\nCognition believes p-tau217 will be an important and prominent biomarker in future CT1812 Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials.\n\n**About CT1812** CT1812 is an experimental orally delivered small molecule oligomer antagonist that penetrates the blood-brain barrier and binds selectively to the sigma-2 (σ-2) receptor complex. Preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that this binding results in the displacement of toxic Aβ oligomers. The σ-2 receptor complex is involved in the regulation of key cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and autophagy that are damaged by toxic interaction with Aβ oligomers, oxidative stress and other stressors. This damage to sensitive synapses can progress to a loss of synaptic function, which manifests as cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease progression.\n\nParticipants are currently being recruited in the START study ([NCT05531656](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jn4N5DU4l08Y-v-NB7RV9UUclZNxIgnRPIBqnWpSHg22IhH-VY7D4FIA_FLuZH86UCAesqNtt3USZD4MducNuazr4KUcxvyVvOHbfwmrtTo= \"NCT05531656\")) of CT1812 in adults with early Alzheimer’s disease; and the MAGNIFY study ([NCT05893537](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jn4N5DU4l08Y-v-NB7RV9epTtp6n9lsZdYppMAHM1qsIEb7P6311a6A-tyeF8B5Xdxy1Lrbqs2Cg0E_fvP0k8ALqtSPwdWYoFfw4Nt0wQI8= \"NCT05893537\")) in adults with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration.

(Nasdaq: CGTX),** a clinical-stage company developing product candidates that treat neurodegenerative disorders, (the “Company” or “Cognition”) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“In the third quarter and recent weeks Cognition Therapeutics achieved one of the most important milestones in its history as the Phase 2 SHINE study results became available. Among the many findings in the SHINE study, new and compelling data presented at CTAD showed a near-total preservation of cognition (as measured by the ADAS-Cog11 and MMSE scales) in a sub-group of Alzheimer’s patients treated with CT1812 who had p-tau217 levels below median,” said [Lisa Ricciardi, Cognition’s president and CEO](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DDvumN7lLAWFdVAJqLklsDg9MoLJ_a9a7iwmtR06pNdHqtXSH6sDlAqMwnyvIVlsZZ-JCdoOX58l6n6i6lPf30PNh9YWagad6GN1oRdNSuxK64bzHIDk_QTIcYKboq0r7MeNdgXlQkFj2mHYgyxF_yCXRAxdMf28GZYpMJMdlT0= \"Lisa Ricciardi, Cognition’s president and CEO\"). “We are moving rapidly to advance CT1812 in Alzheimer’s disease and plan to request an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA where we will review CT1812’s safety and tolerability profile as well as the totality of results from SHINE. We will seek alignment with the FDA on a pivotal Phase 3 program design in light of recent findings relating to lower levels of plasma p-tau217, an important biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease pathology easily measured with a blood test.”\n\nMs. Ricciardi concluded: “In addition to the substantial progress we have made with CT1812 in Alzheimer’s disease, we expect to report top-line results from our Phase 2 SHIMMER study in mild-to-moderate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) by the end of this year. DLB is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, yet few therapies have been studied in this indication and no disease-modifying treatments exist. SHIMMER will deliver safety and tolerability data in a second indication and potentially provide insights to be integrated into a larger clinical study in this under-studied and under-represented population.”\n\n**Business and Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * Results of a pre-specified analysis from the Phase 2 SHINE study of CT1812 in participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease were presented in an oral session at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference \n    * Patients with baseline levels of p-tau217 below the median showed a 95% slowing of cognitive decline on the ADAS-Cog11 scale and 108% slowing of cognitive decline on the MMSE scale*\n    * Lower levels of plasma p‑tau217 are indicative of less advanced Alzheimer’s pathology, and we believe may identify patients likely to have a greater response to therapy\n    * The [CTAD presentation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NdOEwikM00VLUmNfRnPkhkJGg10UrbwZR4SZyoCIImzeSGRHx7v8ivL4gq-WyfXuwjwU6NPNSeMB1KGramLRxeDMscHx7E5UQerGkKeo8v1F8DYcotXiqPCdfYWd2ijiCv2HyctLZ321cwL_dZLP3C08EYRSeDwoSh1TQe1JZG0= \"CTAD presentation\") by Dr. Michael Woodward and an archive of [investor webinar](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VxAD4dNzBnKY3eqSdwVSAQeQivXd0XQXEHB9yNIMHFy_AlzwvIPMOSAoTkwb0VTR7x6O3baHwEN-P0GgSjg2Q4ciEBbsNyaUDv15r_7hftkZMU9k8gJhhHc8KvxPsuVQ \"investor webinar\") are available on the Cognition website\n  * Baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in the Phase 2 SHIMMER study were also presented at CTAD, confirming enrollment of individuals with mild-to-moderate DLB \n    * This poster is available on the [Company’s website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d6SVhT9GjiHySmBNN8FQLfKoTAWtFPuEtwm0LciEuuotaGhfkFGyn4EbZBTJPem2pu4fuphpuRgtdkD_HsDK27vcZ3LzSaW1qfWLdvqcO-YMS9q8B9e66b-794Td1N_8 \"Company’s website\")\n  * Continued enrollment in Phase 2 START study ([NCT05531656](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8dCx1E0cUMZh-F1uOltQzeEi5MQJ28m2y2hEvNeUNKiuADCr3SjIBSJphfweR-KKfXihaAWDXn4UrA_h-VYEmHqKqeHEwmc1KVYgAgrxHFY= \"NCT05531656\")) in early Alzheimer’s disease and Phase 2 MAGNIFY study ([NCT05893537](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8dCx1E0cUMZh-F1uOltQzekYfKD34fO883VsosLSFLTxK3oVFZ5Cs1GN5bIznXOMYS5R2AMPhUaydJ4fvyTFue6E3jB9wwLetm0incuwIIk= \"NCT05893537\")) in geographic atrophy secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were approximately $22.0 million and total grant funds remaining from the NIA were $53.6 million. The Company estimates that it has sufficient cash to fund operations and capital expenditures into the second quarter of 2025.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $11.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.7 million for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was primarily related to lower costs with contract manufacturing organizations for the production of pre-clinical and future clinical trial supply.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.1 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.1 million for the comparable period in 2023. The change in general & administrative expenses was not significant in either period.\n\nThe Company reported a net loss of $9.9 million, or $(0.25) per basic and diluted share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $6.7 million, or $(0.22) per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2023.\n\n* ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (11-task version); MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination\n\n**About Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.** [Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3QdhHjihuR7W0t3097zYB_b8CyQj7TZc7Ut8AmSEmC4l9pHSCGJcyh4q6RnTrOIzkbt_OiDeVhdX4QcKjoXbvJ3l18wwlU5p64TCl7w2938= \"Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.\"), is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative disorders of the central nervous system and retina.
