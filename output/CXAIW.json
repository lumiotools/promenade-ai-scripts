The Company is now in full compliance as regards to regulatory filings and within the requisite Nasdaq timelines.\n\nThe delay in the 10Q filing was because of the initial delay in the filing of the yearly 10K as the Company had undergone a business combination in 2023. The 10Q filing can be accessed at [_https://ir.cxapp.com/node/7561/html_](https://pr.report/Zgw7kFIA). The 10Q filing is a week after we filed our annual 10K ([_https://ir.cxapp.com/node/7556/html_](https://pr.report/sWxfSXhm)) on May 24th, 2024 which includes our audited financials.\n\nAs we announced last week on our earnings call, the Company achieved a record Net Retention Rate (NRR) of 108% in the first quarter of 2024 and positive trending of key SaaS metrics. This growth is tied to renewals and expansions of seven large Fortune 1000 logos in Q1 across all five verticals- financial services, technology, consumer, healthcare and entertainment.\n\nThe CXAI technology platform represents a shift towards an AI-centric approach in workplace innovation. CXAI seamlessly integrates customer experience (CX) with artificial intelligence (AI) focused around the employee to deliver solutions that transform the way work happens, making workspaces more intuitive and efficient leading to happier and more engaged employees.\n\n[_Khurram Sheikh_](https://pr.report/aG8DKWR0), Chairman and CEO of CXApp Inc, expressed confidence in the Company's performance: \"We are happy to share our 10K and 10Q filings where we have made significant achievements including increased ARR and strong balance sheet giving confidence to our customers, partners and stakeholders. We continue to make great progress in shaping the future of work with our record NRR rate this quarter following our record ARR growth in 2023. Our existing customers have reposed confidence in the CXAI technology platform and our roadmap. We are solving real problems in the work environment for them, and they are now planning to scale up with our AI-first solutions across their enterprise footprint\".\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nBetween January 1st - March 31st,2024 we had record increase in NRR to 108% that was accomplished primarily by renewing and expanding seven of our large Fortune 1000 across all five verticals.\n\nOur **subscription-based recurring** revenue of $1.58M was **87%** of the total revenue of $1.818M, a metric which has been trending upward quarter after quarter and this quarter marks the highest ever in our history, increased 6 points from last quarter.\n\nOur **gross margin** for the quarter was **82%** which is an attractive figure that has increased over the last four quarters as our subscription revenues have increased.\n\nCXAI's strategy of **‘land & expand'** continues to be a key contributor to growing subscription revenues with our existing customer base and with the new CXAI VU analytics product offering we are looking to ramp up product expansions.\n\nWe have continued to optimize the operational cost structure leveraging our investments in AI and headcount rationalization resulting in a net **20%** cash operating expense reduction from Q4'23 to Q1'24.\n\n**Khurram Sheikh** concluded \"Q1 was a great start to our business in 2024 and given that AI is transformative to all markets, we are extremely optimistic on the transformation in the workplace experience market using our leading-edge AI platform.
