Reports Third Quarter 2024 Unaudited Financial Results\n\nNovember 25, 2024 at 6:00 PM EST\n\nSHENZHEN, China, Nov. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. (“Lexin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: LX), a leading technology-empowered personal financial service enabler in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Total loan origination for the third quarter reached approximately RMB51.0 billion, remaining stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but reflecting a 19.5% decrease year-over-year. The outstanding loan balance was RMB111.2 billion, down by 3.4% quarter-over-quarter and by 7.8% year-over-year. These figures align with the guidance we provided earlier, reflecting our prudent operational principles amid the challenges of a sluggish macroeconomic recovery,” said Jay Wenjie Xiao, Chairman and CEO of Lexin. “However, despite the trend of a declining loan volume, our net profit reached RMB310 million, a substantial increase of 36.7% compared to RMB227 million in the previous quarter.”\n\n“Improved profitability is part of a strong set of operational and financial results we delivered this quarter, demonstrating that we are well on track for a comprehensive business turnaround.”\n\n“During the past quarter, our persistent efforts in executing transformation strategies led to a record low funding cost, gradual improvement in asset quality, and a substantial increase in new users with approved credit lines.”\n\n“Considering the gradual business recovery, we remain committed to returning more value to shareholders. The Board has approved an amended dividend payout policy, increasing the payout ratio to 25% of net profit starting in 2025.”\n\n“Looking ahead, while we are cautious about the short-term economic outlook and anticipate that the recently released government stimulus measures targeting at an economic recovery will gradually take effect, we remain confident in Lexin’s ability to navigate through uncertainties and sustain the recovery momentum by delivering solid results quarter by quarter,” Concluded Mr. Xiao.\n\n“During the past quarter, we have delivered another set of robust financial results,” said Mr. James Zheng, Chief Financial Officer of Lexin. “The third quarter's total operating revenue reached approximately RMB3.7 billion, up by 4.4% year-over-year and stable quarter-over-quarter. Net profit for the third quarter reached RMB310 million, a substantial growth of 36.7% compared to the previous quarter. This significant increase in net profit is largely attributable to the improved net revenue take rate of our core loan business, supported by continuous risk improvements in newly issued loans, a significant reduction in funding costs by nearly 100 basis points over the past quarter, and a slight improvement in the early repayment behavior. Given the ongoing improvement in our overall asset quality and the continuous execution of our transformation initiatives, we expect to report more positive progress in the year ahead.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Operational Highlights:**\n\n**User Base**\n\n  * Total number of registered users reached 223 million as of September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 9.3% from 204 million as of September 30, 2023, and users with credit lines reached 44.1 million as of September 30, 2024, up by 6.1% from 41.6 million as of September 30, 2023.\n  * Number of active users1 who used our loan products in the third quarter of 2024 was 4.3 million, representing a decrease of 11.4% from 4.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Number of cumulative borrowers with successful drawdown was 33.1 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.9% from 30.9 million as of September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Loan Facilitation Business**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, we cumulatively originated RMB1,273.2 billion in loans, an increase of 21.2% from RMB1,050.7 billion as of September 30, 2023.\n  * Total loan originations2 in the third quarter of 2024 was RMB51.0 billion, a decrease of 19.5% from RMB63.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Total outstanding principal balance of loans3 reached RMB111 billion as of September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 7.8% from RMB121 billion as of September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Credit Performance****4**\n\n  * 90 day+ delinquency ratio was 3.7% as of September 30, 2024, as compared with 3.7% as of June 30, 2024.\n  * First payment default rate (30 day+) for new loan originations was below 1% as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Tech-empowerment Service**\n\n  * For the third quarter of 2024, we served over 90 business customers with our tech-empowerment service.\n  * In the third quarter of 2024, the business customer retention rate5 of our tech-empowerment service was over 90%.\n\n\n\n**Installment E-commerce Platform Service**\n\n  * GMV6 in the third quarter of 2024 for our installment e-commerce platform service was RMB827 million, representing a decrease of 40.1% from RMB1,381 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * In the third quarter of 2024, our installment e-commerce platform service served over 240,000 users and 400 merchants.\n\n\n\n**Other Operational Highlights**\n\n  * The weighted average tenor of loans originated on our platform in the third quarter of 2024 was approximately 13.2 months, as compared with 13.1 months in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Repeated borrowers’ contribution7 of loans across our platform for the third quarter of 2024 was 85.5%.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Total operating revenue was RMB3,662 million, representing an increase of 4.4% from the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Credit facilitation service income was RMB2,970 million, representing an increase of 10.6% from the third quarter of 2023.

The increase was driven by the increases in loan facilitation and servicing fees-credit oriented, partially offset by the decrease in financing income and guarantee income.\n\n_Loan facilitation and servicing fees-credit oriented_ increased by 20.7% from RMB1,533 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB1,851 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase in takerate of loan facilitation business.\n\n_Guarantee income_ decreased by 2.9% from RMB639 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB620 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease of outstanding balances in the off-balance sheet loans funded by certain institutional funding partners, which are accounted for under ASC 460, _Guarantees_. \n\n_Financing income_ decreased by 2.8% from RMB514 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB499 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the origination of on-balance sheet loans.\n\n**Tech-empowerment service income** decreased by 15.5% from RMB454 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB384 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of loan facilitation volume under the profit-sharing model.\n\n**Installment e-commerce platform service income** decreased by 16.6% from RMB369 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB308 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in transaction volume in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Cost of sales** decreased by 14.3% from RMB360 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB308 million in the third quarter of 2024, which was consistent with the decrease in installment e-commerce platform service income.\n\n**Funding cost** decreased by 33.4% from RMB132 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB87.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, which was primarily driven by the decrease in the cost of funding and funding debts to fund the on-balance sheet loans.\n\n**Processing and servicing costs** increased by 35.1% from RMB446 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB602 million in the third quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in risk management and collection expenses.\n\n**Provision for financing receivables** was RMB261 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB162 million for the third quarter of 2023. The lifetime expected credit losses recognized was estimated based on the most recent performance in relation to the Company's on-balance sheet loans, taking into consideration the forward-looking factors.\n\n**Provision for contract assets and receivables** was RMB244 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB159 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in loan facilitation and servicing fees.\n\n**Provision for contingent guarantee liabilities** was RMB952 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB894 million in the third quarter of 2023. The fluctuation was primarily due to the re-measurement of the expected loss rates and the origination of the off-balance sheet loans funded by certain institutional funding partners, which are accounted for under ASC 460, Guarantees.\n\n**Gross profit** decreased by 11.0% from RMB1,356 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB1,207 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Sales and marketing expenses** was RMB438 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB411 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased investment in marketing.\n\n**Research and development expenses** was RMB149 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB127 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased investment in technology development.\n\n**General and administrative expenses** was RMB89.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB85.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Change in fair value of financial guarantee derivatives and loans at fair value** was a loss of RMB151 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to a loss of RMB246 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change in fair value was primarily due to the re-measurement of the expected loss rates, partially offset by the fair value gains realized as a result of the release of guarantee obligation.\n\n**Income tax expense** was RMB72.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB116 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change was primarily due to the decrease of income before income tax expense.\n\n**Net income** decreased by 16.5% from RMB371 million in the third quarter of 2023 to RMB310 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Recent Development**\n\n**Amended Dividend Policy**\n\nThe board of directors of the Company has approved an amended dividend payout policy, under which the payout ratio will be increased to 25% of total net profit starting from January 1, 2025.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company’s management will host an earnings conference call at 9:00 PM U.S. Eastern time on November 25, 2024 (10:00 AM Beijing/Hong Kong time on November 26, 2024).\n\nParticipants who wish to join the conference call should register online at:\n\n[https://register.vevent.com/register/BI220a892f574848f0b2997fb493e6296f](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Et3uXh3zp2LdtcxiUrcdXbnWtO4-UdicgMfJ8ji3HvLuWVO3EqklXEldfteax3NrymchYbyLtTQoPAhpJHWLY7y_u24glVXEVjc29b0C1zleR1yJIW6DcKtEMXDMlJRReKDv1NBu4drF_p961UQ6079vkVKq1SIfoHSLgTX-hnBUIxZiYzozZpOF5rBSc_MHOTBeFS8DOVnbjnh_O8Av7k57f4z7gXnyeAaDiiIaK4c=)\n\nOnce registration is completed, each participant will receive the dial-in number and a unique access PIN for the conference call.\n\nParticipants joining the conference call should dial in at least 10 minutes before the scheduled start time.\n\nA live and archived webcast of the conference call will also be available at the Company's investor relations website at <http://ir.lexin.com>.\n\n**About LexinFintech Holdings Ltd.**\n\nWe are a leading credit technology-empowered personal financial service enabler.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company as net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company excluding share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible notes, and investment income/(loss) and we define non-GAAP EBIT as net income excluding income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses, interest expense, net, and investment income/(loss).\n\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible notes, and investment income/(loss). Non-GAAP EBIT, on the other hand, enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses, interest expense, net, and investment income/(loss). We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ assessment of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and non-GAAP EBIT is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible notes, income tax expense, interest expense, net, and investment income/(loss) have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and non-GAAP EBIT. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\n\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**Exchange Rate Information Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.0176 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on September 30, 2024. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements. These statements are made under the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Unaudited Financial Results\n\nAugust 27, 2024 at 7:00 PM EDT\n\nSHENZHEN, China, Aug. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. (“Lexin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: LX), a leading technology-empowered personal financial service enabler in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n\"We harvested a healthy set of operational and financial results with improved risk performance for new loans, uplifted net profit from the first quarter of 2024, and controlled loan origination in the second quarter of 2024,\" said Jay Wenjie Xiao, Chairman and CEO of Lexin. \"Total loan origination for the second quarter reached RMB 51.1 billion, a 12% decline quarter-over-quarter. Nevertheless, both total operating revenue and net profit grew by 12% compared to the first quarter of 2024, this was despite continued soft consumer demand and a weak credit environment.\"\n\n\"Attributing to our persistent efforts to uphold our key strategies, we achieved several milestones during past quarter, including a rapid growth in our overseas business, a new record-low funding cost, and positive signs of overall risk performance improvement.\"\n\n\"By leveraging Lexin's over a decade of experience in the domestic fintech market and quickly replicating our business model overseas, we saw an accelerated growth in our international operations, far outpacing our domestic business in the second quarter. Although the current scale of our overseas business is still small, we will continue to invest and sharpen our focus abroad.\"\n\n\"Despite quarterly fluctuations in some risk performance indicators, more risk metrics showed early signs of improvement that extended into August. This was due to the proactive control on loan origination and substantial risk management capability improvement over the past quarters.\"\n\n\"Additionally, our funding cost hit a historical low with a significant quarterly drop compared to the previous quarter. This improvement in funding cost effectively boosted our profitability compared to the first quarter of 2024.\"\n\n\"Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024, we remain confident in navigating challenges and seizing opportunities in both Chinese and overseas markets, positioning ourselves for sustainable growth in a cautious consumer environment. We are committed to returning sustainable value to shareholders and have declared a cash dividend payout of US$0.072 per ADS for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024, representing roughly 20% of total net income, continuing our consistent capital return program,\" Mr. Xiao continued.\n\nMr. James Zheng, Chief Financial Officer of Lexin, added, \"The second quarter's total operating revenue reached RMB 3.6 billion, showing a 19.1% year-over-year increase and a 12.3% quarter-over-quarter increase. Net profit for the second quarter reached RMB 227 million, a 12.4% increase from the previous quarter. This significant revenue rise was achieved despite a controlled loan origination volume, demonstrating a substantial expansion of our revenue take rate. This increase was primarily driven by improved risk performance of newly issued assets and a record-low funding cost. Furthermore, we resumed ABS issuance in May and completed the second ABS in July, with the senior tranche funding cost as low as 2.80%. Additional factors such as a slight improvement in the early repayment ratio and an increased revenue split ratio in our profit-sharing model, also bolstered our resilient financial results in the second quarter.\"\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Operational Highlights:**\n\n**User Base**\n\n  * Total number of registered users reached 219 million as of June 30, 2024, representing an increase of 10.2% from 199 million as of June 30, 2023, and users with credit lines reached 43.3 million as of June 30, 2024, up by 5.8% from 41.0 million as of June 30, 2023.\n  * Number of active users1 who used our loan products in the second quarter of 2024 was 4.2 million, representing a decrease of 16.4% from 5.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Number of cumulative borrowers with successful drawdown was 32.5 million as of June 30, 2024, an increase of 6.8% from 30.5 million as of June 30, 2023.**Loan Facilitation Business**\n\n\n  * As of June 30, 2024, we cumulatively originated RMB1,222.2 billion in loans, an increase of 23.8% from RMB987.4 billion as of June 30, 2023.\n  * Total loan originations2 in the second quarter of 2024 was RMB51.1 billion, a decrease of 20.1% from RMB63.9 billion in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Total outstanding principal balance of loans2 reached RMB115 billion as of June 30, 2024, representing an increase of 0.9% from RMB114 billion as of June 30, 2023.**Credit Performance**\n\n\n  * 90 day+ delinquency ratio was 3.7% as of June 30, 2024, as compared with 3.0% as of March 31, 2024.\n  * First payment default rate (30 day+) for new loan originations was below 1% as of June 30, 2024.**Tech-empowerment Service**\n\n\n  * For the second quarter of 2024, we served over 80 business customers with our tech-empowerment service.\n  * In the second quarter of 2024, the business customer retention rate3 of our tech-empowerment service was over 90%.**Installment E-commerce Platform Service**\n\n\n  * GMV4 in the second quarter of 2024 for our installment e-commerce platform service was RMB933 million, representing a decrease of 37.2% from RMB1,487 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * In the second quarter of 2024, our installment e-commerce platform service served over 290,000 users and 400 merchants.**Other Operational Highlights**\n\n\n  * The weighted average tenor of loans originated on our platform in the second quarter of 2024 was approximately 12.8 months, as compared with 14.7 months in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Repeated borrowers’ contribution5 of loans across our platform for the second quarter of 2024 was 85.3%.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Total operating revenue was RMB3,641 million, representing an increase of 19.1% from the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Credit facilitation service income was RMB2,669 million, representing an increase of 24.9% from the second quarter of 2023.

The increase was driven by the increases in loan facilitation and servicing fees-credit oriented and guarantee income, partially offset by the decrease in financing income.\n\n_Loan facilitation and servicing fees-credit oriented_ increased by 51.5% from RMB946 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB1,433 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the better control over the early repayment behaviors.\n\n_Guarantee income_ increased by 17.0% from RMB618 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB722 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by the increase of outstanding balances in the off-balance sheet loans funded by certain institutional funding partners, which are accounted for under ASC 460, _Guarantees_. \n\n_Financing income_ decreased by 10.6% from RMB574 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB513 million in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the origination of on-balance sheet loans.\n\n**Tech-empowerment service income** increased by 36.5% from RMB392 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB535 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase of loan facilitation volume under the profit-sharing model.\n\n**Installment e-commerce platform service income** decreased by 17.0% from RMB526 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB437 million in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in transaction volume in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Cost of sales** decreased by 9.1% from RMB465 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB423 million in the second quarter of 2024, which was consistent with the decrease in installment e-commerce platform service income.\n\n**Funding cost** decreased by 41.8% from RMB156 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB90.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, which was primarily driven by the decrease in the cost of funding and funding debts to fund the on-balance sheet loans.\n\n**Processing and servicing costs** increased by 16.3% from RMB446 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB519 million in the second quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in risk management and collection expenses.\n\n**Provision for financing receivables** was RMB171 million for the second quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB146 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in performance of the on-balance sheet loans.\n\n**Provision for contract assets and receivables** was RMB155 million in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB125 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in loan facilitation and servicing fees and the decrease in performance of the off-balance sheet loans.\n\n**Provision for contingent guarantee liabilities** was RMB935 million in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB722 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase of outstanding balances of the off-balance sheet loans funded by certain institutional funding partners, which are accounted for under ASC 460, _Guarantees_ , as well as the decrease in performance of the off-balance sheet loans.\n\n**Gross profit** increased by 35.4% from RMB995 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB1,348 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Sales and marketing expenses** was RMB467 million in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB453 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Research and development expenses** was RMB143 million in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB121 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased investment in technology development.\n\n**General and administrative expenses** RMB100 million in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB96.5 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Change in fair value of financial guarantee derivatives and loans at fair value** was a loss of RMB368 million in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to a gain of RMB130 million in the second quarter of 2023. The change in fair value was primarily due to the re-measurement of the expected loss rates, partially offset by the fair value gains realized as a result of the release of guarantee obligation.\n\n**Income tax expense** is RMB60.0 million in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to RMB80.8 million in the second quarter of 2023. The change was primarily due to the decrease of income before income tax expense.\n\n**Net income** decreased by 36.3% from RMB356 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB227 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Recent Development**\n\nSemi-Annual Dividend\n\nThe board of directors of the Company has approved a dividend of US$0.036 per ordinary share, or US$0.072 per ADS, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 in accordance with the Company’s dividend policy, which is expected to be paid on October 18, 2024 to shareholders of record (including holders of ADSs) as of the close of business on September 16, 2024 New York time.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company’s management will host an earnings conference call at 10:00 PM U.S. Eastern time on August 27, 2024 (10:00 AM Beijing/Hong Kong time on August 28, 2024).\n\nParticipants who wish to join the conference call should register online at:\n\n[https://register.vevent.com/register/BI3c6bd663baef41b58321967fdd88a0d6](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3CnJQZppFVRu3Y52wPyEwzrGfwwM-toCye87zJ-MTlJXRDErN9jaMOK9ToY4WxLcQpRaP0TYlKM91PPNzPfsErUvZPslx4ZnU9lI_GnVDq64najh31juxAg03-3S7_2KV9oRJyDwKAOVInOQX1bKv3qL9k1tSuIibdv6PqoslZz4ezlWoEWpEST6IsV1d1HxicENLPqsMTs6NKBMWd1t8BcdAOiMZS4vjz1EsYVtC-E=)\n\nOnce registration is completed, each participant will receive the dial-in number and a unique access PIN for the conference call.\n\nParticipants joining the conference call should dial in at least 10 minutes before the scheduled start time.\n\nA live and archived webcast of the conference call will also be available at the Company's investor relations website at <http://ir.lexin.com>.\n\n**About LexinFintech Holdings Ltd.**\n\nWe are a leading credit technology-empowered personal financial service enabler.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company as net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company excluding share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible notes, and investment income/(loss) and we define non-GAAP EBIT as net income excluding income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses, interest expense, net, and investment income/(loss).\n\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible notes, and investment income/(loss). Non-GAAP EBIT, on the other hand, enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses, interest expense, net, and investment income/(loss). We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ assessment of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and non-GAAP EBIT is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible notes, income tax expense, interest expense, net, and investment income/(loss) have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and non-GAAP EBIT. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\n\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**Exchange Rate Information Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.
