Forward looking statements include statements regarding our goals, plans, projections and guidance regarding our financial position, results of operations, market position, pending and potential future financing transactions and business strategy, and often contain words such as “project,” “outlook,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “may,” “seek,” “would,” “should,” “likely,” “goal,” “strategy,” “future,” “maintain,” “continue,” “remain,” “target” or “will” and similar references to future periods.\n\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events that depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements in this press release. The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimated or projected results include, without limitation, future economic and financial conditions (both nationally and locally), changes in customer demand, our relationship with, and the financial and operational stability of, vehicle manufacturers and other suppliers, risks associated with our indebtedness (including our ability to obtain further waivers or amendments to credit agreements, the actions or inactions of our lenders, available borrowing capacity, our compliance with financial covenants and our ability to refinance or repay indebtedness on terms acceptable to us), acts of God or other incidents which may adversely impact our operations and financial performance, government regulations, legislation and others set forth throughout under the headers “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” and in the notes to our financial statements, in our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Annual Report on Form 10-Kand from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to carefully consider this information and not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no duty to update our forward-looking statements, including our earnings outlook, which are made as of the date of this release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted cash flow from operations, adjusted costs applicable to revenue, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, adjusted income (loss) before income taxes, adjusted SG&A, and adjusted income (loss) from operations. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, we review any non-GAAP financial measures in connection with a review of the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution you not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, and also to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We present cash flows from operations in the following tables, adjusted to include the change in non-trade floor plan debt to improve the visibility of cash flows related to vehicle financing. As required by SEC rules, we have reconciled these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the attachments to this release. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures we present improve the transparency of our disclosures; provide a meaningful presentation of our results from core business operations, because they exclude items not related to core business operations and other non-cash items; and improve the period-to-period comparability of our results from core business operations. These presentations should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measures.\n\n**Contact** :investors@lazydays.com\n\n**Results of Operations**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |

(“Lazydays,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”) (NasdaqCM: GORV) today announced a series of transformative transactions designed to provide the Company with a significantly strengthened financial foundation and a more focused dealership portfolio. These transactions, which include a comprehensive recapitalization and certain asset sales, will result in meaningful reductions in the Company’s debt, interest and preferred stock dividend payments, substantial added cash to the balance sheet, and an improvement in the underlying earnings power of the business.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Lazydays\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/682603/Lazydays_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/682603/Lazydays_Logo.html)\n\n**Transaction Highlights**\n\n  * We agreed to sell seven dealerships, including real estate where applicable, and issue common stock to certain indirect subsidiaries of Camping World Holdings, Inc. (“Camping World”) for a combined $65.5 million, subject to conditions.\n  * We agreed to sell one additional dealership asset to a separate buyer for $8 million, subject to conditions.\n  * We closed a $30 million common equity PIPE at $1.03 per share with clients of Alta Fundamental Advisers and Coliseum Capital Management (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”).\n  * We plan to launch a $25 million rights offering at $1.03 per share, allowing all our common stockholders (other than the PIPE Investors and Camping World) to purchase common stock at the same price as PIPE Investors, subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declaring a registration statement on Form S-1 effective.\n  * We agreed to exchange all outstanding convertible preferred stock for common stock at $1.03 per share, eliminating our preferred stock liquidation preference, preferred dividend requirement and other preferred stockholder rights, subject to conditions.\n  * We executed an amendment to the credit facility with the Company’s lender group led by Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”), providing significant financial flexibility.\n  * The transactions will collectively result in $65 million reduction of debt, elimination of $68 million preferred stock liquidation preference, and $16 million reduction of interest and preferred dividend payments.\n  * Pro forma for the transactions (excluding proceeds and shares from the proposed rights offering), Lazydays is expected to have $35 million of cash on the balance sheet, debt of $61 million (excluding floor plan financings), and 119.5 million shares of common stock outstanding.\n\n\n\n“We are pleased to announce these transformative transactions, which streamline our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility for the benefit of the Company and all of our stakeholders – investors, customers, OEM partners, and employees,” said Robert DeVincenzi, Chairman of Lazydays. “Collectively, these transactions represent a critical step in the revitalization of Lazydays’ business and demonstrate the confidence that investors have in our long-term success. We are grateful for the support we have received from Alta, Coliseum, Camping World and our lender group led by M&T Bank, and look forward to building upon the robust financial foundation we have set today to reaffirm Lazydays’ position as a leader in the RV industry.”\n\n“Today marks a turning point for the trajectory of Lazydays,” added Ronald Fleming, Interim CEO of Lazydays. “The last couple of years have proven challenging as we navigated the economic environment and determined the optimal path forward for the business, and I am grateful for the dedication and hard work of our employees during this time. I am confident that as a nimbler organization with enhanced liquidity, Lazydays’ brightest days are ahead.”\n\nMarcus Lemonis, Chairman and CEO of Camping World commented, “Lazydays has been a part of the fabric of the RV industry for over 30 years, and its health is important to Camping World, the RV industry, and our OEM partners. We are encouraged to see the Company take the necessary steps to fortify its balance sheet and make progress towards streamlining its portfolio.”\n\nMr. DeVincenzi concluded, “Lazydays is an iconic brand with a longstanding reputation for providing exceptional service and experiences to RV owners. By monetizing certain assets and recapitalizing the business, we have committed to upholding Lazydays’ incredible legacy, while restoring stockholder value.”\n\n**Asset Sales and Stock Issuance**\n\nLazydays has entered into agreements to sell certain assets, subject to conditions. Under the terms of the agreements, Lazydays will sell seven dealerships, including owned real estate for three of the dealerships, and issue 9.7 million shares of common stock to Camping World for $65.5 million. Lazydays will also sell one dealership to a separate buyer for cash proceeds of $8 million, subject to conditions. These dispositions will create a leaner, more focused operational footprint for Lazydays comprised of 15 dealerships nationwide and over $95 million of owned real estate value across nine locations.\n\n**Comprehensive Recapitalization**\n\nIn conjunction with the asset sales and stock issuance to Camping World, Lazydays has entered into securities purchase agreements with the PIPE Investors for the sale and issuance of $30 million of common stock through a private investment in public equity financing exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “PIPE”). The PIPE was priced at $1.03 per share, which will result in the issuance of 29.1 million new shares of common stock.\n\nThe Company plans to file a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a rights offering that will provide all common stockholders (other than the PIPE Investors and Camping World) with the opportunity to purchase shares of common stock at the same price per share as the PIPE Investors and Camping World, subject to the registration statement being declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

We are mailing this Information\nStatement on or about December 6, 2024 to our stockholders who did not execute and deliver a Written Consent and\nfrom whom we did not solicit consent.

The Charter Amendment will become effective no earlier than on the 20th day after the Information\nStatement is mailed to our stockholders and would occur thereafter only after the filing of a certificate of amendment\nto our certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.\nWhat actions were approved by the Written Consent?\nPursuant to the Written Consent, the Majority Holders approved and adopted an amendment to our certificate of\nincorporation to increase the total number of shares of Common Stock the Company is authorized to issue from\n100,000,000 to 500,000,000 (the \"Charter Amendment”).\nWhat is the Background to the Charter Amendment?\nThe Charter Amendment was approved and adopted in part in order to accommodate future issuances of Common\nStock required by certain financing arrangements the Company has entered into or plans to enter into, as further\ndescribed below, and to allow for additional future issuances.\nThe market for recreational vehicles (\"RVs”) is cyclical and is influenced by general economic conditions as well as\nmore particularly by consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, fuel prices, interest rates and\ncredit availability. Between the peaks and valleys of the market cycles, annual unit shipments fluctuate significantly,\nwith unit shipments for the RV industry over a market cycle often doubling or tripling from valley to peak. Over\napproximately the last four decades, full market cycles have had duration of approximately 15 years.\nCompanies in the industry are challenged over the market cycle to manage inventories and costs to address often\nunpredictable changes in demand. Gradual adjustments in market conditions can be more effectively managed when\ncompared to abrupt and dramatic changes since RV retailing cost models are heavily influenced by inventory\ncarrying costs and SG&A, which are difficult to adjust in short timeframes.\nStarting in the third quarter of 2022, as interest rates rose and consumer confidence softened, the RV retail industry\nbegan experiencing a pronounced drop in demand, resulting in:\n• More intense competitive pressures as RV retailers pursue fewer RV buyers resulting in lower gross profits;\n• Excessive levels of inventory and model year changes creating unit obsolescence and associated\ndiscounting;\n• Longer inventory holding periods and curtailment payment obligations;\n• Lower trade-in ratios as recently purchased units lose relative market value; and\n• Reductions in non-trade in used unit purchases and resales as customers retain their existing units.\n1\nFurther, market participants experienced inflationary pressures on product and overhead costs.\nIn addition to facing these industry-wide challenges, we faced additional challenges to our cash position based on\nour capital investment strategy, including:\n• Basing part of our geographic expansion strategy on \"greenfield” new dealership builds, which consume\ncapital both for construction and to fund operating losses while the sites reach full production over a 2–3-\nyear period;\n• Investing significant capital in our existing facilities to make them fit for purpose and scale and to ensure\nthey provide our customers a peerless experience; and\n• Implementing a strategy focused on investing capital in owning rather than leasing our dealership\nlocations.\nBeyond stressors related to our capital investment strategy, we also experienced higher than expected operating\nlosses because some of our dealership locations underperformed financial and market share expectations.\nOn August 7, 2023, our Board of Directors (the \"Board”) formed a Financing Committee of the Board\n(the \"Financing Committee”), composed solely of independent directors, and appointed Robert DeVincenzi,\nJames J. Fredlake and Jordan Gnat to serve as the members of the Financing Committee. The Financing Committee\nwas originally formed by the Board to explore and review potential financing transactions for the purpose of funding\ngrowth.\nThe Company has a syndicated, senior secured floorplan credit facility and revolving credit facility, evidenced by a\nSecond Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended from time to time, the \"M&T Credit Agreement”)\nwith Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, as administrative agent (in such capacity, \"M&T”), which is\nsecured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our personal property. The Company is subject to numerous\noperating covenants under the terms of the M&T Credit Agreement.\nIn light of the dynamics facing the Company and the need for additional liquidity to support Company operations in\nthe final quarter of 2023, the Board reformed the Financing Committee on December 22, 2023 and appointed\nRobert DeVincenzi, James J. Fredlake, and Susan Scarola, all independent directors, as members. The Board\nempowered the Financing Committee to oversee the analysis, negotiation and execution of a financing subject to\ncertain parameters established by the Board. Between December 22, 2023 and December 29, 2023, the Financing\nCommittee met periodically with members of Company management and advisors to consider various financing\nalternatives and terms. At the direction of the Financing Committee, the Company negotiated a $35 million real estate-\nbacked term loan, evidenced by a Loan Agreement (as amended from time to time, the \"CCM Loan Agreement”) with\nColiseum Holdings I, LLC (the \"CCM Mortgage Lender”), a client of Coliseum Capital Management, LLC (\"CCM”),\nas lender, which was, prior to the effectiveness of the CCM Loan Agreement First Amendment (as defined below),\nsecured by all of our owned real estate except our owned real estate that is mortgaged pursuant to the First Horizon\nMortgages (as defined below) and except for our owned real property located in Fort Pierce, Florida. Following\nnegotiations, the CCM Loan Agreement and related transactions were unanimously authorized by the Financing\nCommittee. The parties then entered into the CCM Loan Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were\nconsummated on December 29, 2023.\nOur debt facilities have since consisted of:\n• the M&T Credit Agreement;\n• the CCM Loan Agreement; and\n• two term loan agreements with First Horizon Bank, which are secured by certain owned real estate of ours\nthat is located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee (together, the \"First Horizon\nMortgages”).\nDue to the factors described above and the decline in our operational performance to levels below prior expectations,\nthis year it became necessary for us to pursue a series of amendments to, and to obtain waivers of defaults (or future\nevents that were anticipated to be defaults) under, the M&T Credit Agreement and the CCM Loan Agreement. In\naddition, we determined that we needed to raise additional capital to support our balance sheet and provide\nadditional working capital for our operations. Consistent with its mandate, the Financing Committee explored various\nfinancing alternatives throughout the first half of 2024.\n2\nBy the beginning of March 2024, the Company faced potential non-compliance with its covenants under the\nM&T Credit Agreement. With authorization from the Board upon the recommendation of the Financing Committee,\non March 8, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and\nConsent (the \"First M&T Credit Agreement Amendment”) with M&T and the lenders party to the M&T Credit\nAgreement (the \"M&T Lenders”) to obtain waivers of and modifications to certain covenants under the M&T Credit\nAgreement. Among other changes, the First M&T Credit Agreement Amendment eliminated testing of the total net\nleverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants until the fiscal quarter ending September 30,\n2024 and reduced the required minimum current ratio financial covenant until the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024.\nAdditionally, the first amendment created new financial covenants for minimum consolidated EBITDA and minimum\nliquidity. The first amendment also restricted our ability to make certain investments, dispositions and restricted\npayments, and it added a new pricing tier to the leveraged-based pricing grid for the M&T Credit Agreement, with\npricing 35 basis points higher than the highest tier immediately prior to the first amendment.\nFollowing the signing of the First M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the Financing Committee continued to hold\nperiodic meetings and pursue financing alternatives. However, the Company continued to face similar headwinds,\nand as of March 31, 2024, we were not in compliance with all of our covenants under the M&T Credit Agreement, as\namended and waived earlier that month, as we did not meet our minimum trailing twelve-month minimum EBITDA\nrequirement.\nTo address the Company’s continued non-compliance with its covenants under the M&T Credit Agreement, on\nMay 14, 2024 the Company negotiated and entered into, at the direction of the Financing Committee, the Second\nAmendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Consent (the \"Second M&T Credit\nAgreement Amendment”) with M&T and the M&T Lenders. The Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment\nreduced the M&T Lenders’ aggregate floor plan commitment under the M&T Credit Agreement from $525 million to\n$480 million and further amended the definition of the applicable margin to provide that, until the company achieved a\ntotal net leverage ratio for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2025 that was less than 3.00 to 1.00 (such period, the\n\"Ratio Adjustment Period”), pricing would further increase by 15 basis points higher than the highest tier that was\nin effect under the First M&T Credit Agreement Amendment. The Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment also\nprovided that, during the Ratio Adjustment Period, the company would no longer be permitted to borrow revolving\nloans under the M&T Credit Agreement. Under the Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, testing of the total\nnet leverage and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants were eliminated until the fiscal quarter ending March\n31, 2025, and the minimum amounts for the current ratio financial covenant were reduced until the fiscal quarter\nending March 31, 2025. The Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment also made certain adjustments to the\nminimum consolidated EBITDA and minimum liquidity financial covenants. We agreed in the Second M&T Credit\nAgreement Amendment to further restrictions on investments and dispositions, and we agreed to certain additional\nrestrictions on transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, as a condition to entering into the Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, M&T required that the\nCompany pay down $10.0 million on the revolving credit facility by December 31, 2024, and the Company concluded\nit would need to raise additional financing to make those payments. The Company, by and under the direction of the\nFinancing Committee, sought out potential financing alternatives to aid the Company in making the payments\nrequired by M&T, and the Financing Committee held periodic meetings with members of Company management and\nadvisors. After the Company failed to secure any actionable financing alternatives by mid-May 2024, we proposed\namending the CCM Loan Agreement to provide an additional $15.0 million in debt financing under the CCM Loan\nAgreement. Following negotiations with CCM undertaken at the direction of the Financing Committee, the Financing\nCommittee recommended, and the Board of Directors unanimously approved such amendment to the CCM Loan\nAgreement upon such recommendation of the Financing Committee. Christopher S. Shackelton, a Series A Director\n(as defined below) at the time who is also the co-founder and managing partner of CCM, did not participate in the\napproval process for amending the CCM Loan Agreement.\nOn May 15, 2024 we entered into a First Amendment to Loan Agreement (the \"CCM Loan Agreement\nFirst Amendment”), with the CCM Mortgage Lender, which provided for an additional $15.0 million mortgage loan\nsecured by our owned real property that is located in Fort Pierce, Florida in addition to the other remaining real estate\nproperties backing the CCM Loan Agreement. In connection with the CCM Loan Agreement First Amendment, and\nas a condition to the CCM Mortgage Lender providing the additional financing thereunder, we also issued to\nColiseum Capital Partners, L.P. (\"CCP”) and Blackwell Partners LLC – Series A (\"Blackwell”), each an advisory\n3\nclient of CCM and owner of CCM Mortgage Lender, warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a\nprice of $5.25 per share, subject to certain adjustments (the \"CCM Warrants”). Those warrants may be exercised at\nany time on or after May 15, 2024 and until May 15, 2034.\nIn June 2024, we entered into a new engagement agreement with our investment banker, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company,\nIncorporated, including its business division, Miller Buckfire & Co. (collectively, \"Miller Buckfire”), to advise the\nCompany in connection with a review of strategic alternatives, including to raise additional sources of capital. In\nadvance of launching a formal financing process on August 1, 2024, Miller Buckfire prepared a financing offering\nmemorandum and populated a detailed virtual data room for use in soliciting interest from investors. Through\nNovember 2024, Miller Buckfire has run a targeted, yet comprehensive, financing process, contacting 39 parties,\ncomprised of 4 strategic investors and 35 financial parties. These parties include investors identified by\nMiller Buckfire, investors identified by the Company and CCM as well as investors that expressed interest following\nthe Company’s August 2024 announcement that it engaged Miller Buckfire to raise incremental capital. 15 of these\nparties executed confidentiality agreements, received the financing offering memorandum and access to the\nCompany’s virtual data room and were offered meetings with management. Throughout the process, Miller Buckfire\nexpressed to prospective investors that the Company was willing and open to evaluate all financing structures,\nprovided such financing structure would alleviate the Company’s liquidity needs and be acceptable to existing\nparties. None of the parties other than those involved in the transactions described herein expressed any written\nindication of interest or a letter of intent regarding a potential transaction.\nThroughout the months that followed the Company’s entry into the Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment and\nthe CCM Loan Agreement First Amendment, and the Company’s receipt of the additional financing pursuant to the\nCCM Loan Agreement First Amendment, the Company continued to face headwinds and challenges with the\nsatisfaction of its debt covenants under the M&T Credit Agreement along with substantial liquidity challenges.\nDuring this period, the Financing Committee and Company representatives continued to seek out various financing\nalternatives, and the Financing Committee continued to hold periodic meetings with members of Company\nmanagement and advisors.\nIn the months that followed our entry into the Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment and the CCM Loan\nAgreement First Amendment, we entered into a series of limited waiver agreements in July, August, and\nSeptember 2024 (collectively, the \"M&T Limited Waiver Agreements”) with M&T and the M&T Lenders. The M&T\nLimited Waiver Agreements provided a temporary waiver of defaults resulting from, among other things:\n• our inability to comply with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant with respect to June, July, August,\nSeptember and October 2024;\n• our inability to comply with the minimum liquidity financial covenant for July, August, September and\nOctober 2024;\n• our inability to comply with the minimum current ratio financial covenant for our fiscal quarters ended\nJune 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024; and\n• the filing of certain mechanic’s, materialman’s, construction or similar liens against certain of our real\nproperty, relating to our failure to pay for certain improvements made thereto.\nUnder the M&T Limited Waiver Agreements, we decreased the M&T Lenders’ aggregate floor plan commitment\nunder the M&T Credit Agreement from $480 million to $400 million and agreed to a temporary limit on the outstanding\nfloor plan loans of $380 million. We also agreed, among other terms, to repay the revolving credit facility by an\nadditional $1.0 million; to provide M&T and the M&T Lenders with an increased level of financial reporting; to\nengage CR3 Partners as our financial advisor; to cause an employee of CR3 Partners to be appointed as our interim\nChief Financial Officer until a permanent Chief Financial Officer reasonably acceptable to M&T is selected and\napproved by our board of directors; to attempt to raise new capital and to engage an investment banker to assist us\nin connection with doing so; to a new average daily liquidity financial covenant, which was tested weekly; to\nrestrictions on transactions, including investments and dispositions, outside of the ordinary course of business; and\nto refrain from declaring dividends or making other restricted payments.\nIn September 2024, our former Chief Executive Officer, John North, and our former Chief Financial Officer,\nKelly Porter, resigned. Our Board then appointed Ronald K. Fleming, a former Senior Vice President of Operations of\nthe Company, as our Interim Chief Executive Officer; promoted Amber Dillard as our Chief Operating Officer; and\nappointed Jeff Huddleston, a partner at CR3 Partners, as our Interim Chief Financial Officer.\n4\nOn September 27, 2024, and with the approval and at the direction of the Financing Committee, we entered into a\nLimited Waiver of Defaults with the CCM Mortgage Lender (the \"CCM Loan Agreement Waiver”), pursuant to\nwhich the CCM Mortgage Lender waived certain defaults relating to the filing of certain mechanic’s, materialman’s,\nconstruction or similar-type liens filed or to be filed against the real property mortgaged to the CCM Mortgage\nLender, provided that such liens are discharged of record (by payment, bonding or otherwise) by certain deadlines.\nWith assistance of Miller Buckfire, acting at the direction of the Financing Committee, the Company pursued\nalternative sources of financings and concluded that the following capital-raising transactions are most likely to\nachieve the Company’s objectives on the terms and on a timeline that is in the best interests the Company and of our\nstockholders. The below transactions were then negotiated at the direction of the Financing Committee and were\nconsidered by the Financing Committee over the course of various meetings held in the weeks preceding its\nrecommendation of such transactions, following which the Financing Committee recommended, and the Board\nunanimously approved, the following transactions:\n• Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment. On November 15, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited\nWaiver and Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Consent\n(the \"Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment”), with M&T and the M&T Lenders.\n○ The Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment grants the Company waivers of specified defaults and\nevents of default that occurred under the M&T Credit Agreement, including events of default\nresulting from: (a) its inability to comply with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant with respect to\nJune, July, August, September and October 2024; (b) its inability to comply with the minimum liquidity\nfinancial covenant for July, August, September and October 2024; (c) its inability to comply with the\nminimum current ratio financial covenant for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30,\n2024; (d) the filing of certain mechanic’s, materialmen’s, construction or similar liens against certain of\nthe Company’s real property, relating to its failure to pay for certain improvements made thereto; and\n(e) certain cross-defaults under the CCM Loan Agreement and the First Horizon Mortgages relating to\nthe foregoing.\n○ Under the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the lenders’ aggregate commitment under the\nfloorplan facility decreased from $400 million to (a) $325 million, from the date of the Third M&T Credit\nAgreement Amendment through the date (the \"Asset Sale Outside Date”) that is 60 days after the final\nclosing of the Camping World Asset Sales, and (b) $295 million, thereafter through the maturity date,\nprovided that until the Asset Sale Outside Date, the Company may borrow up to an additional\n$10 million in floor plan loans (the \"Floor Plan Overlimit Loans”), subject to the satisfaction of\ncertain conditions. To the extent the Company borrows Floor Plan Overlimit Loans, the Company\nagreed to pay the lenders a per annum fee equal to 2.00% of the average daily aggregate principal\namount thereof.\n○ The Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment eliminates testing of the total net leverage ratio,\ncurrent ratio and minimum EBITDA financial covenants until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2026,\nand the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment eliminates testing of the fixed charge coverage\nratio financial covenant until the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2026. The Third M&T Credit\nAgreement Amendment also changes the required performance targets for compliance with all of the\nCompany’s financial covenants. The minimum liquidity financial covenant now requires the Company\nto maintain liquidity, as of the end of each calendar month, of not less than $7.5 million.\n○ The Company also agreed in the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, among other changes: (a)\nto permanently eliminate its ability to borrow new loans or swingline loans or to request issuance of\nletters of credit under the revolving credit facility; (b) to make certain mandatory repayments on the\nrevolving credit facility (including on the date of the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, in the\namount of $10 million; beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025 and on the last day of\neach quarter thereafter, in the amount of $2.5 million each quarter; on the date that is two business\ndays after completion of the Rights Offering (as defined below), in the amount of 50% of the proceeds\nthereof; and repayments from time to time in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds (less certain\ncosts, fees and expenses and after repayment of any indebtedness required to be repaid in connection\ntherewith) received from any sale or refinancing of the Company’s real estate, excluding real property\nto be sold in the Camping World Asset Sales and certain real property located\n5\nin Waller, Texas that the Company is attempting to sell); (c) to deliver to M&T second-lien mortgages,\nwhich will secure the Company’s remaining obligations under the revolving credit facility, on all of the\nCompany’s real property that is currently mortgaged to the CCM Mortgage Lender, except for real\nproperty to be sold in the Camping World Asset Sales and certain real property located in Waller,\nTexas that the Company is attempting to sell; (d) until March 31, 2025, to continue engaging CR3\nPartners as the Company’s financial advisor, and to continue engaging CR3 Partners (or an employee\nthereof) as the Company’s interim chief financial officer until a permanent chief financial officer\nreasonably acceptable to M&T is selected and approved by the Company’s board of directors; (e) to\nadditional restrictions on investments, indebtedness, dividends and other restricted payments,\ntransactions with affiliates and acquisitions; and (f) to replace the leverage-based pricing grid from the\nM&T Credit Agreement with a fixed margin over SOFR or the Base Rate (as applicable), described\nfurther below.\n○ After giving effect to the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the floor plan credit facility bears\ninterest at (a) one-month term SOFR or daily SOFR plus 2.55% or (b) the Base Rate plus 1.55%, and the\nrevolving credit facility bears interest at (x) one-month term SOFR or daily SOFR plus an applicable\nmargin of 3.40% or (b) the Base Rate plus a margin of 2.40%. After giving effect to the Third M&T\nCredit Agreement Amendment and the repayment of a portion of the principal amount thereof\ndescribed above, the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility is $31.0 million.\n○ Under the terms of the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, if the Company fails to consummate\nall of the Camping World Asset Sales on or before March 31, 2025, or if it terminates the governing\npurchase agreements before consummation of those sales, it will constitute an event of default under\nthe M&T Credit Agreement.\n• $30 million PIPE. Also on November 15, 2024, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements\nwith each of Blackwell, Alta Fundamental Advisers Master LP, and Star V Partners LLC, as advisory clients\nof Alta Fundamental Advisers LLC (\"Alta”, and such clients, the \"Alta PIPE Parties”), and CCP and\nBlackwell, as advisory clients of CCM (the \"CCM PIPE Parties”, and collectively with the Alta PIPE\nParties, the \"PIPE Parties”), for the sale and issuance of an aggregate of 29,126,212 shares of Common\nStock at a price per share of $1.03 (the \"PIPE Price”), which was equal to the Minimum Price as defined in\nNasdaq Stock Market Rule 5635(d), in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended (the \"PIPE”). The proceeds will be used for general corporate and operational purposes,\nincluding repayment of indebtedness.\n• Asset and stock sale. Also on November 15, 2024, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into an\nAsset Purchase Agreement and a Real Estate Purchase Agreement for the (i) sale to certain affiliates of\nCamping World Holdings, Inc. (\"Camping World”) of dealership assets and (where owned by an affiliate\nof the Company) real estate at the Company’s Council Bluffs, Iowa, Elkhart, Indiana, Sturtevant, Wisconsin,\nMurfreesboro, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Surprise, Arizona, and Woodland, Washington locations (the\n\"Camping World Asset Sales”), and (ii) the sale and issuance to CWGS Ventures, LLC (collectively with\nthe CCM PIPE Parties and the Alta PIPE Parties, the \"Excluded Rights Offering Parties”), an affiliate of\nCamping World, of 9,708,737 shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal to the PIPE Price, effective\nupon the closing of the final sale of assets under the Camping World Asset Sales (the \"Camping World\nStock Sale”).\n• Preferred exchanges. Also on November 15, 2024, as a condition of Camping World’s affiliates entering\ninto the Asset Purchase Agreement and Real Estate Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into\nPreferred Stock Exchange Agreements (the \"Exchange Agreements”) with each of the CCM PIPE Parties,\nPark West Partners International, Limited (\"PWPI”), and Park West Investors Master Fund, Limited\n(\"PWIMF”), to exchange all of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value\n$0.0001 per share (\"Series A Preferred Stock”), held by such parties for a number of shares of Common\nStock equal to the accumulated liquidation preference of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock divided by\nthe PIPE Price (the \"Preferred Exchanges”). An aggregate of 150,001 shares of Series A Preferred Stock\nwere exchanged for an aggregate of 16,622,238 shares of Common Stock in a first series of exchanges on\nNovember 15, 2024, and an aggregate of 449,999 shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be exchanged for an\naggregate of 49,866,710 shares of Common Stock in a second series of exchanges following the\neffectiveness of the Charter Amendment.\n6\n• Charter Amendment. The Board and (pursuant to the Written Consent) the Majority Holders approved\nand adopted the Charter Amendment in order to authorize sufficient shares of Common Stock for future\nissuances, including the second closing of the Preferred Exchanges and the Rights Offering (as defined\nbelow), allow for required reserves, and other future issuances as approved by the Board (and, if required,\nthe Company’s stockholders).\nIn addition, at the request of the PIPE Parties in order to afford other stockholders of the Company the opportunity to\npurchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal to the PIPE Price, and as required by the Third M&T\nCredit Agreement Amendment, the Company will conduct a rights offering consisting of our distribution, after a\nregistration statement on Form S-1 is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC”), to\neach of our stockholders and holders of warrants to purchase our stock (other than the Excluded Rights Offering\nParties, who have irrevocably elected to waive their right to such distribution) (each such stockholder or warrant\nholder, a \"Rights Holder”), of the right to purchase a certain number of shares of Common Stock for each share of\nCommon Stock (or each share of Common Stock into which such stockholder’s shares of Series A Preferred Stock is\nconvertible and each share of Common Stock for which such holder’s warrants are exercisable) held by such\nstockholder or warrant holder at a price per share of $1.03 (the same price as used in the PIPE and Preferred\nExchanges), in transactions we intend to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission using a registration\nstatement on Form S-1 (the \"Rights Offering”). Rights Holders who fully exercise their subscription rights will be\nentitled to subscribe for additional shares of Common Stock that remain unsubscribed as a result of any unexercised\nsubscription rights (the \"Over-Subscription Right”). Subscription rights may only be exercised for whole numbers of\nshares; no fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued in the Rights Offering.\nThe Financing Committee, and the Board acting upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee, have\ndetermined that the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the PIPE, the Camping World Asset Sales, the\nCamping World Stock Sale, the Preferred Exchanges, the Rights Offering, and the Charter Amendment are advisable,\nfair, and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and the Majority Holders approved and adopted\nthe Charter Amendment.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the M&T Credit Agreement, the First M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the\nSecond M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the M&T Limited\nWaiver Agreements, the CCM Loan Agreement, the CCM Loan Agreement First Amendment, the CCM Loan\nAgreement Waiver, the Securities Purchase Agreements, the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Real Estate Purchase\nAgreement, and the Exchange Agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such\nagreements, copies of which were filed as exhibits to our annual, quarterly, or current reports filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, and each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The representations,\nwarranties and covenants contained in such agreements were made only for purposes of such agreements and as of\nspecific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements and may be subject to limitations agreed\nupon by the contracting parties.\nThis Information Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, shall not constitute an offer\nto sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any rights, Common Stock or any other securities, nor shall there be any\noffer, solicitation or sale of the rights, the Common Stock or any other securities in any state or jurisdiction in which\nsuch offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction.\nWho is paying the costs associated with this Information Statement?\nWe will pay for preparing, printing and mailing this Information Statement. Arrangements may be made with banks,\nbrokerage houses and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries, to forward this Information Statement to beneficial\nowners of our stock. We will, upon request, reimburse those persons and entities for expenses incurred in forwarding\nthis Information Statement to our stockholders.\n7\nMATTER 1\nAPPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION\nCharter Amendment\nThe Company’s certificate of incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of a maximum of 100,000,000 shares of\nCommon Stock. As of November 11, 2024, there were 14,190,663 shares of Common Stock outstanding. The\nconsummation of the PIPE on November 15, 2024 resulted in the issuance of 29,126,212 shares of Common Stock, and\n16,622,238 shares of Common Stock were issued in Preferred Exchanges on November 15, 2024. In addition, a\nmaximum of 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock may be issued in the Rights Offering, 49,866,710 shares of Common\nStock remain to be issued upon completion of the remaining Preferred Exchanges, and 9,708,737 will be issued in the\nCamping World Stock Sale. Finally, the Company must maintain a number of authorized but unissued shares of\nCommon Stock to reserve for the total number into which its outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are\nconvertible, the total number for which its outstanding warrants to purchase Common Stock are exercisable and the\ntotal number of shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with equity awards. In order to accommodate these\nissuances and share reserve requirements, and allow for other future issuances as approved by the Board (and, if\nrequired, the Company’s stockholders), the Majority Holders approved and adopted the Charter Amendment, which\nis an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of Common Stock the\nCompany is authorized to issue from 100,000,000 to 500,000,000. A copy of the Charter Amendment is set forth in\nExhibit A attached hereto.\nStockholders Entitled to Receive Notice of Action by Written Consent\nUnder Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and our Amended and Restated Bylaws,\nany action that can be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without\nprior notice and without a vote, if the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of\nvotes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote\nthereon were present, consent to such action in writing. Prompt notice of any action so taken by written consent\nmust be provided to all non-consenting holders of our capital stock. This Information Statement and the Notice of\nAction by Written Consent of Stockholders enclosed herewith collectively constitute notice to our stockholders\nentitled thereto of stockholder approval and adoption of the Charter Amendment by less than unanimous written\nconsent of our stockholders pursuant to Section 228(e) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.\nNecessity of Stockholder Approval\nSection 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires stockholder adoption of the Charter\nAmendment.\nEffective Date of Action Authorized by Written Consent\nPursuant to Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act, the corporate action approved by the Written Consent may become\neffective no earlier than twenty (20) calendar days after the first mailing or delivery of this Information Statement to\nstockholders of the Company from whom the Company did not solicit consent to the Charter Amendment. This\nInformation Statement provides a summary of the action approved and adopted by the Majority Holders pursuant to\nthe Written Consent.\nInterests of Directors and Executive Officers\nPursuant to the Company’s Certificate of Designations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value\n$0.0001 per Share (the \"Certificate of Designations”), the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding\nshares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to designate two of the Company’s directors (each such director, a\n\"Series A Director”). In addition to a majority in voting power of the Company’s outstanding shares of capital stock,\nvoting together as a single class, CCM (through its advisory clients CCP and Blackwell) holds a majority in voting\npower of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock, and has designated Jerry Comstock,\nwho has served as a director of the Company since 2018, as a Series A Director. There is currently only one serving\nSeries A Director.\n8\nFrom 2018 until his resignation in June 2024, Christopher S. Shackelton, co-founder and managing partner of CCM,\nserved as a Series A Director.\nCCP and Blackwell constituted two of the Majority Holders approving the Charter Amendment.\nDissenter’s and Appraisal Rights\nStockholders and beneficial owners do not have any dissenter’s rights or appraisal rights in connection with the\napproval of the Charter Amendment or the authorization thereof.\n9\nVOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF\nOutstanding Voting Securities\nAs of the Written Consent Record Date and Time, 59,939,113 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding,\nand 449,999 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.\nEach holder of issued and outstanding Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter presented to\nthe Company’s stockholders for approval. Accordingly, the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock, as\nsuch, were collectively entitled to 59,939,113 votes as of the Written Consent Record Date and Time.\nExcept as otherwise provided by applicable law or the Certificate of Designations, the holders of shares of Series A\nPreferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of Common Stock, and not as a separate class, on all\nmatters presented to the Company’s stockholders for approval. Each holder of issued and outstanding Series A\nPreferred Stock is entitled to that number of votes equal to the whole number of shares of Common Stock into which\nsuch holder’s aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible (pursuant to Section 6 of the\nCertificate of Designations but as restricted in the case of any Electing Holder (as defined in the Certificate of\nDesignations) by Section 14 of the Certificate of Designations) as of the close of business on the record date for the\ndetermination of stockholders entitled to vote on or consent to such matters. Subject to the foregoing, each holder of\nshares of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to the largest number of full shares of\nCommon Stock into which all shares of preferred stock held of record by such holder could then be converted (taking\ninto account, for the avoidance of doubt, the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Certificate of Designations)\nthen in effect (the Liquidation Preference includes all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock)\nfor purposes of the Conversion Rate (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) and any Conversion Price (as\ndefined in the Certificate of Designations) adjustments made pursuant to Section 8 of the Certificate of Designations)\nat the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on or consent to such matters.

A beneficial owner’s percentage\nownership is determined by assuming that options, warrants and convertible securities that are held by the beneficial\nowner, but not those held by any other person, and which are exercisable or convertible within 60 days, have been\nexercised or converted.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of Common Stock and Series A\nPreferred Stock as of the Written Consent Record Date and Time by (i) each of our directors and named executive\nofficers, (ii) all of our directors and executive officers as a group, and (iii) each stockholder known by us to be the\nbeneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities.

(the \"Company,” \"we,” \"us” or \"our”) is distributing to the holders (excluding the PIPE Investors (as defined below), who have waived their\nand their respective affiliates’ rights to receive the Rights (as defined below) to the extent any of them are holders as of the Record Date (as defined below)) (such non-excluded\nholders, collectively, the \"Holders”) of our outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \"Common Stock”) and our outstanding warrants (the\n\"Warrants”), in each case as of the Record Date (as defined below), non-transferable rights (the \"Rights”) to purchase up to an aggregate of $25,000,000 in shares of our\nCommon Stock at a cash subscription price of $1.03 per share (the \"Rights Offering”). Assuming the Rights Offering is fully subscribed, we currently expect to receive\naggregate gross proceeds of $25,000,000. You will not be entitled to receive any Rights unless you are a Holder of record as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024\n(the \"Record Date”). Holders, as of the Record Date, will receive one Right for every share of Common Stock held or issuable upon exercise or conversion of Warrants held as\nof the Record Date.\nThe Rights will expire if they are not exercised by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024, the expected expiration date of this Rights Offering. We, in our sole\ndiscretion, may extend the period for exercising the Rights. Rights which are not exercised by the expiration date of the Rights Offering will expire and will have no value.\nYou should carefully consider whether or not to exercise your Rights before the expiration date. Once you have exercised your Rights, your exercise may not be revoked.\nRights may only be exercised in whole numbers of shares of Common Stock, and we will not issue fractional shares. Each Right will entitle you to purchase\n[3.05] shares (as well as the right to purchase any additional shares pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right (as defined below)) at a subscription price per whole share of\nCommon Stock equal to $1.03. After aggregating all of the shares subscribed for by a particular Holder, including shares subscribed for pursuant to the Over-Subscription\nRight, any fractional shares of our Common Stock that would otherwise be created by the exercise of the Rights by that Holder will be rounded down to the nearest whole\nshare for purposes of determining the number of shares of our Common Stock for which you may subscribe, with such adjustments as may be necessary to ensure that we offer a\nmaximum of 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. Each Right consists of a basic subscription right (the \"Basic Subscription Right”) and an over-\nsubscription right (the \"Over-Subscription Right”). The Rights under the Basic Subscription Right will be distributed in proportion to Holders’ holdings on the Record Date\n(excluding the holdings of the PIPE Investors and affiliates thereof who have waived their respective rights to receive the Rights).

The\nanswers are based on selected information from this prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference in this\nprospectus. The following questions and answers do not contain all of the information that may be important to you\nand may not address all of the questions that you may have about the Rights Offering. This prospectus and the\ndocuments incorporated by reference in this prospectus contain more detailed descriptions of the terms and\nconditions of the Rights Offering and provide additional information about us and our business, including potential\nrisks related to the Rights Offering and the shares of our Common Stock.\nExercising the Rights and investing in our Common Stock involves significant risks. We urge you to carefully\nread the section titled \"Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 of this prospectus and the section titled \"Risk Factors” in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for\nthe quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, and all other information included\nor incorporated by reference in this prospectus in its entirety before you decide whether to exercise your Rights.\nQ: What is the Rights Offering?\nA: The Rights Offering is a distribution of Rights on a pro rata basis to Holders of our Common Stock and\nWarrants (in the case of the Warrants, as though such Warrants are exercised in full and on an as-converted basis)\n(excluding the PIPE Investors and the respective affiliates thereof to the extent holders as of the Record Date) who\nhold such securities as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024, the Record Date. \"Pro rata” means, in proportion\nto the number of total shares of our Common Stock that our Holders hold on the Record Date on an as-converted\nbasis (assuming the exercise of the Warrants in full). You will receive one Right for every share of Common Stock\nheld or issuable upon exercise or conversion of Warrants held as of the Record Date. We will not issue fractional\nshares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. After aggregating all of the shares subscribed for by a particular\nHolder, including shares subscribed for pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right, any fractional shares of our\nCommon Stock that would otherwise be created by the exercise of the Rights by that Holder will be rounded down to\nthe nearest whole share, with such adjustments as may be necessary to ensure that we offer a maximum of 24,271,844\nshares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. In the unlikely event that, because of the rounding of fractional\nshares, this Rights Offering would have been subscribed in an amount in excess of 24,271,844 shares of Common\nStock, all Holders’ shares issued in this Rights Offering will be reduced in an equitable manner. Any excess\nsubscription payments received by the Subscription Agent in respect of fractional shares will be returned promptly\nafter the expiration of the Rights Offering without interest or deduction.\nQ: Why are we conducting the Rights Offering?\nA: Due to industry-wide challenges facing the recreational-vehicle (\"RV”) retail industry and the decline in our\noperational performance to levels below prior expectations, we determined that we needed to raise additional capital\nto support our balance sheet and provide additional working capital for our operations. On August 7, 2023, our Board\nof Directors (the \"Board”) formed a Financing Committee of the Board (the \"Financing Committee”), composed solely\nof independent directors.\nConsistent with its mandate, the Financing Committee explored various financing alternatives throughout the\nfirst half of 2024 and concluded that the following capital-raising transactions are most likely to achieve the\nCompany’s objectives on the terms and on a timeline that is in the best interests the Company and of our\nstockholders. The below transactions were then negotiated at the direction of the Financing Committee and were\nconsidered by the Financing Committee over the course of various meetings held in the weeks preceding its\nrecommendation of such transactions, following which the Financing Committee recommended, and the Board\nunanimously approved, the following transactions:\n• Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment. On November 15, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited\nWaiver and Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Consent (the\n\"Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment”), with M&T and the lenders party thereto (the \"M&T\nLenders”).\n○ The Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment grants the Company waivers of specified defaults and\nevents of default that occurred under the M&T Credit Agreement, including events of default\niv\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nresulting from: (a) its inability to comply with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant with respect to\nJune, July, August, September and October 2024; (b) its inability to comply with the minimum liquidity\nfinancial covenant for July, August, September and October 2024; (c) its inability to comply with the\nminimum current ratio financial covenant for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30,\n2024; (d) the filing of certain mechanic’s, materialmen’s, construction or similar liens against certain of\nthe Company’s real property, relating to its failure to pay for certain improvements made thereto; and\n(e) certain cross-defaults under the loan agreement (the \"CCM Loan Agreement”) with respect to our\nreal estate-backed loan with Coliseum Holdings I, LLC (the \"CCM Mortgage Lender”) and our\nmortgages with First Horizon Bank relating to the foregoing.\n○ Under the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the lenders’ aggregate commitment under the\nfloorplan facility decreased from $400 million to (a) $325 million, from the date of the Third M&T Credit\nAgreement Amendment through the date (the \"Asset Sale Outside Date”) that is 60 days after the final\nclosing of the Camping World Asset Sales (defined below), and (b) $295 million, thereafter through the\nmaturity date, provided that until the Asset Sale Outside Date, the Company may borrow up to an\nadditional $10 million in floor plan loans (the \"Floor Plan Overlimit Loans”), subject to the satisfaction\nof certain conditions. To the extent the Company borrows Floor Plan Overlimit Loans, the Company\nagreed to pay the lenders a per annum fee equal to 2.00% of the average daily aggregate principal\namount thereof.\n○ The Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment eliminates testing of the total net leverage ratio,\ncurrent ratio and minimum EBITDA financial covenants until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2026,\nand the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment eliminates testing of the fixed charge coverage\nratio financial covenant until the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2026. The Third M&T Credit\nAgreement Amendment also changes the required performance targets for compliance with all of the\nCompany’s financial covenants. The minimum liquidity financial covenant now requires the Company\nto maintain liquidity, as of the end of each calendar month, of not less than $7.5 million.\n○ The Company also agreed in the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, among other changes: (a)\nto permanently eliminate its ability to borrow new loans or swingline loans or to request issuance of\nletters of credit under the revolving credit facility; (b) to make certain mandatory repayments on the\nrevolving credit facility (including on the date of the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, in the\namount of $10 million; beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025 and on the last day of\neach quarter thereafter, in the amount of $2.5 million each quarter; on the date that is two business\ndays after completion of this Rights Offering, in the amount of 50% of the proceeds thereof; and\nrepayments from time to time in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds (less certain costs, fees\nand expenses and after repayment of any indebtedness required to be repaid in connection therewith)\nreceived from any sale or refinancing of the Company’s real estate, excluding real property to be sold\nin the Camping World Asset Sales and certain real property located in Waller, Texas that the Company\nis attempting to sell); (c) to deliver to M&T second-lien mortgages, which will secure the Company’s\nremaining obligations under the revolving credit facility, on all of the Company’s real property that is\ncurrently mortgaged to the CCM Mortgage Lender, except for real property to be sold in the Camping\nWorld Asset Sales and certain real property located in Waller, Texas that the Company is attempting\nto sell; (d) until March 31, 2025, to continue engaging CR3 Partners as the Company’s financial\nadvisor, and to continue engaging CR3 Partners (or an employee thereof) as the Company’s interim\nchief financial officer until a permanent chief financial officer reasonably acceptable to M&T is\nselected and approved by the Company’s board of directors; (e) to additional restrictions on\ninvestments, indebtedness, dividends and other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates and\nacquisitions; and to replace the leverage-based pricing grid from the M&T Credit Agreement with a\nfixed margin over SOFR or the Base Rate (as applicable), described further below.\n○ After giving effect to the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the floor plan credit facility bears\ninterest at (a) one-month term SOFR or daily SOFR plus 2.55% or (b) the Base Rate plus\nv\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1.55%, and the revolving credit facility bears interest at (x) one-month term SOFR or daily SOFR plus\nan applicable margin of 3.40% or (b) the Base Rate plus a margin of 2.40%. After giving effect to the\nThird M&T Credit Agreement Amendment and the repayment of a portion of the principal amount\nthereof described above, the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility is $31.0 million.\n○ Under the terms of the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, if the Company fails to consummate\nall of the Camping World Asset Sales on or before March 31, 2025, or if it terminates the governing\npurchase agreements before consummation of those sales, it will constitute an event of default under\nthe M&T Credit Agreement.\n• $30 million PIPE. Also on November 15, 2024, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements\nwith each of Blackwell, Alta Fundamental Advisers Master LP, and Star V Partners LLC, as advisory clients\nof Alta Fundamental Advisers LLC (\"Alta”, and such clients, the \"Alta PIPE Parties”), and CCP and\nBlackwell, as advisory clients of CCM (the \"CCM PIPE Parties”, and collectively with the Alta PIPE Parties,\nthe \"PIPE Parties”), for the sale and issuance of an aggregate of 29,126,212 shares of Common Stock at a\nprice per share of $1.03 (the \"PIPE Price”), which was equal to the Minimum Price as defined in Nasdaq\nStock Market Rule 5635(d), in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended (the \"PIPE”). The proceeds will be used for general corporate and operational purposes, including\nrepayment of indebtedness.\n• Asset and stock sale. Also on November 15, 2024, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into an\nAsset Purchase Agreement and a Real Estate Purchase Agreement for the (i) sale to certain affiliates of\nCamping World Holdings, Inc. (\"Camping World”) of dealership assets and (where owned by an affiliate of\nthe Company) real estate at the Company’s Council Bluffs, Iowa, Elkhart, Indiana, Sturtevant, Wisconsin,\nMurfreesboro, Tennessee, Portland, Oregon, Surprise, Arizona, and Woodland, Washington locations (the\n\"Camping World Asset Sales”), and (ii) the sale and issuance to CWGS Ventures, LLC (collectively with the\nCCM PIPE Parties and the Alta PIPE Parties, the \"Excluded Rights Offering Parties”), an affiliate of Camping\nWorld, of 9,708,737 shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal to the PIPE Price, effective upon the\nclosing of the final sale of assets under the Camping World Asset Sales (the \"Camping World Stock Sale”).\n• Preferred exchanges. Also on November 15, 2024, as a condition of Camping World’s affiliates entering\ninto the Asset Purchase Agreement and Real Estate Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into\nPreferred Stock Exchange Agreements (the \"Exchange Agreements”) with each of the CCM PIPE Parties,\nPark West Partners International, Limited (\"PWPI”), and Park West Investors Master Fund, Limited\n(\"PWIMF”), to exchange all of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per\nshare (\"Series A Preferred Stock”), held by such parties for a number of shares of Common Stock equal to\nthe accumulated liquidation preference of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock divided by the PIPE Price\n(the \"Preferred Exchanges”). An aggregate of 150,001 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were exchanged\nfor an aggregate of 16,622,238 shares of Common Stock in a first series of exchanges on November 15, 2024,\nand an aggregate of 449,999 shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be exchanged for an aggregate of\n49,866,710 shares of Common Stock in a second series of exchanges following the effectiveness of the\nCharter Amendment.\n• Charter Amendment. The Board and the stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the\nCompany’s stockholders approved and adopted the Charter Amendment in order to authorize sufficient\nshares of Common Stock for future issuances, including the second closing of the Preferred Exchanges and\nthe Rights Offering, allow for required reserves, and other future issuances as approved by the Board (and,\nif required, the Company’s stockholders).\nIn addition, at the request of the PIPE Parties in order to afford other stockholders of the Company the\nopportunity to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal to the PIPE Price, and as required by the\nThird M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the Company agreed to conduct this Rights Offering.\nThe Financing Committee, and the Board acting upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee, have\ndetermined that the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the PIPE, the Camping World Asset Sales, the\nvi\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCamping World Stock Sale, the Preferred Exchanges, the Rights Offering, and the Charter Amendment are advisable,\nfair, and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and the stockholders holding a majority of the\nvoting power of the Company’s stockholders approved and adopted the Charter Amendment.\nWe believe the Rights Offering ensures that all Holders have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to invest in\nour Common Stock at the same price of $1.03 per share as the PIPE Parties and at the price used in the Preferred\nExchanges, mitigating the dilution they might otherwise experience. Our expectation is to use the proceeds from the\nRights Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, consistent\nwith the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment and our business plan. See \"Use of Proceeds” and \"The Rights\nOffering—Reasons for the Rights Offering.”\nThe foregoing descriptions of the M&T Credit Agreement, the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the\nCCM Loan Agreement, the Securities Purchase Agreements, the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Real Estate\nPurchase Agreement, and the Exchange Agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such\nagreements, copies of which were filed as exhibits to our annual, quarterly, or current reports filed with the SEC, and\neach of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The representations, warranties and covenants\ncontained in such agreements were made only for purposes of such agreements and as of specific dates, were solely\nfor the benefit of the parties to such agreements and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting\nparties.\nQ: What is a Right?\nA: Each Right entitles its Holder to purchase [3.05] shares of our Common Stock (as well as the right to\npurchase any additional shares pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right) at a subscription price of $1.03 per whole\nshare of Common Stock. Each Right carries with it a Basic Subscription Right and an Over-Subscription Right,\nsubject to certain adjustments and limitations described below.\nQ: How was the subscription price of $1.03 per share of Common Stock determined?\nA: In determining the subscription price, a special Board committee of independent directors (the \"Financing\nCommittee”) considered a number of factors, including: the desire to allow our stockholders to participate in the\nRights Offering at the same price as the investors in the PIPE and the Camping World Stock Sale (equal to the\nMinimum Price as defined in Nasdaq Rule 5635(d)), the likely cost of capital from other sources and general\nconditions of the securities markets, the price at which our Holders might be willing to participate in the Rights\nOffering, our expected business need for liquidity and capital, historical and current trading prices of our Common\nStock, and the desire to provide an opportunity to our Holders to participate in the Rights Offering on a pro rata\nbasis. The Financing Committee determined that it was in the best interests of the Company’s Holders to publicly\nannounce the subscription price so that all Holders had the opportunity to determine whether to buy or sell the\nCommon Stock prior to the Record Date. In accordance with best practices, the Financing Committee is composed\nsolely of independent directors. The Financing Committee had authority to determine the type of offering and any\nother terms related to the Rights Offering. In selecting the subscription price, our Financing Committee and\nmanagement wanted to encourage participation in the Rights Offering and strike what they believe to be a fair\nbalance between our capital needs and the market value of the shares of Common Stock sold to the Eligible\nStockholders in this Rights Offering. The Company believes this disclosure has provided its Holders and the public\nwith sufficient information about the Company’s expectation to sell a significant number of shares in the Rights\nOffering, as described herein. The subscription price is not necessarily related to our book value, net worth or any\nother established criteria of value and may or may not be considered the fair value of the Common Stock to be offered\nin the Rights Offering. You should not consider the subscription price as an indication of value of us or our Common\nStock. The market price of our Common Stock may decline during or after the Rights Offering, including below the\nsubscription price for the Common Stock. You should obtain a current quote for our Common Stock before exercising\nyour Rights and make your own assessment of our business and financial condition, our prospects for the future,\nand the terms of the Rights Offering.\nQ: What is the Basic Subscription Right?\nA: The Basic Subscription Right of each Right entitles you to purchase [3.05] shares of Common Stock (as well\nas the right to purchase any additional shares pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right) at a subscription price of\n$1.03 per whole share.\nvii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ: What is the Over-Subscription Right?\nA: Subject to certain limitations described below, the Over-Subscription Right of each Right entitles you, if\nyou fully exercise your Basic Subscription Right, to subscribe for additional shares of our Common Stock at the same\n$1.03 subscription price per share up to that number of shares of Common Stock that are offered in the Rights\nOffering but are not purchased by the other record holders under their Basic Subscription Rights.\nOur Financing Committee has decided that it is in the best interest of the Company that the Over-Subscription\nRight be subject to certain limitations as discussed below.\nQ: What are the limitations of the Over-Subscription Right?\nA: We will be able to satisfy your exercise of the Over-Subscription Right only if other Rights holders do not\nfully exercise their Basic Subscription Rights. If sufficient shares of our Common Stock are available, we will honor\nthe over-subscription requests in full, subject to the limitations below.\nIf over-subscription requests exceed the number of shares which are available, we will allocate the available\nshares pro rata among those Rights holders who oversubscribed based on the number of shares each Rights holder\nsubscribed for under the Basic Subscription Right. Only Record Date Holders who exercise in full all Rights issued to\nthem are entitled to exercise the Over-Subscription Right.\nQ: Will fractional shares be issued upon exercise of the Rights?\nA: No. We will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. After aggregating all of the\nshares subscribed for by a particular Holder, including shares subscribed for pursuant to the Over-Subscription\nRight, any fractional shares of our Common Stock that would otherwise be created by the exercise of the Rights by\nthat Holder will be rounded down to the nearest whole share, with such adjustments as may be necessary to ensure\nthat we offer a maximum of 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. In the unlikely event that,\nbecause of the rounding of fractional shares, this Rights Offering would have been subscribed in an amount in\nexcess of 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock, all Holders’ shares issued in this Rights Offering will be reduced in an\nequitable manner. Any excess subscription payments received by the Subscription Agent in respect of fractional\nshares will be returned promptly after the expiration of the Rights Offering without interest or deduction.\nQ: Has our Board, the Financing Committee or the Company made a recommendation to our stockholders or\nwarrantholders whether to exercise or let lapse their Rights in the Rights Offering?\nA: No. Neither the Company, the Financing Committee nor our Board has, or will, make any recommendation to\nHolders whether to exercise or let lapse their Rights in the Rights Offering. You should make an independent\ninvestment decision about whether to exercise or let lapse your Rights based on your own assessment of our\nbusiness and the Rights Offering. Holders who exercise Rights risk the loss of their investment.\nQ: Will the directors and executive officers participate in this Rights Offering?\nA: To the extent they hold Common Stock as of the Record Date or Common Stock issuable upon exercise or\nconversion of Warrants, our directors and executive officers are entitled to participate in this Rights Offering on the\nsame terms and conditions applicable to all Rights holders. We expect that each of our directors and executive\nofficers will participate in this offering, although they have not committed to do so.\nQ: How do I exercise my Rights?\nA: If you wish to participate in the Rights Offering, you must take the following steps, unless your shares are\nheld by a broker, dealer or other nominee:\n• deliver payment to the Subscription Agent using the method outlined in this prospectus; and\n• deliver a properly completed rights certificate (the \"Rights Certificate”) to the Subscription Agent before\n5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024, unless the expiration date is extended.\nviii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPlease note that if you hold your shares in \"street name” through a broker, dealer, or other nominee who uses\nthe services of the Depository Trust Company (\"DTC”), DTC must receive the subscription instructions, Notice of\nGuaranteed Delivery (if applicable), and payment for the new shares before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the\nexpiration date. See \"The Rights Offering — Procedures for DTC Participants.”\nIf you cannot deliver your Rights Certificate to the Subscription Agent before the expiration of the Rights\nOffering, you may use the procedures for guaranteed delivery as described in this prospectus under \"The Rights\nOffering – Guaranteed Delivery Procedures” beginning on page 38 of this prospectus.\nIf you send a payment that is insufficient to purchase the number of shares of common stock you requested, or\nif the number of shares of Common Stock you requested is not specified in the forms, the Subscription Agent will\nhave the right to reject and return your subscription for correction. If the payment exceeds the subscription price for\nthe full exercise of your Rights (to the extent specified by you), the excess will be refunded to you. In the event that\nthe Rights Offering is cancelled or terminated, all funds received from subscriptions by Holders will be returned.\nInterest will not be payable on any returned funds.\nQ: What should I do if I want to participate in the Rights Offering, but my shares are held in the name of my\nbroker, dealer, or other nominee?\nA: If you hold your shares of our Common Stock in \"street name” through a broker, dealer or other nominee,\nthen your broker, dealer or other nominee is the record holder of the shares you own. The record holder must exercise\nthe Rights on your behalf for the shares of Common Stock you wish to purchase.\nIf you wish to participate in the Rights Offering and purchase shares of Common Stock, please promptly contact\nthe record holder of your shares. We will ask your broker, dealer, or other nominee to notify you of the Rights\nOffering. Holders in certain jurisdictions who hold through a nominee may be required to provide additional\ninformation to their nominees in order to exercise their Rights. Please note that if you hold your shares in \"street\nname” through a broker, dealer, or other nominee who uses the services of DTC, DTC must receive the subscription\ninstructions, Notice of Guaranteed Delivery (if applicable), and payment for the new shares before 5:00 p.m., New\nYork City time, on the expiration date. See \"The Rights Offering — Procedures for DTC Participants.”\nQ: Will I be charged a sales commission or a fee by the Company if I exercise my Rights?\nA: No. We will not charge a brokerage commission or a fee to Rights holders for exercising their Rights.\nHowever, if you exercise your Rights through a broker or nominee, you will be responsible for any fees charged by\nyour broker or nominee.\nQ: Are there any conditions to my right to exercise my Rights?\nA: Yes. Your right to exercise your Rights is subject to the conditions described under \"The Rights Offering —\nConditions to the Rights Offering.”\nQ: May I participate in this Rights Offering if I sell my Common Stock after the Record Date?\nA: The Record Date for this Rights Offering is [•], 2024. If you own Common Stock as of the Record Date, you\nwill receive Rights and may participate in the Rights Offering even if you subsequently sell your Common Stock.\nQ: How soon must I act to exercise my Rights?\nA: The Rights may be exercised beginning on [•], 2024 through 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024, the\nexpiration date of the Rights Offering, unless extended by us. Please note that if you hold your shares in \"street\nname” through a broker, dealer, or other nominee who uses the services of DTC, DTC must receive the subscription\ninstructions, Notice of Guaranteed Delivery (if applicable), and payment for the new shares before 5:00 p.m., New\nYork City time, on the expiration date. See \"The Rights Offering – Procedures for DTC Participants.” If you elect to\nexercise any Rights, the Subscription Agent must actually receive all required documents and payments from you or\nyour broker or nominee at or before the expiration date. We have the option of extending the expiration date of the\nsubscription period in our sole discretion.\nix\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ: When will I receive my Rights Certificate?\nA: As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this prospectus, the Subscription Agent will send a\nRights Certificate to each registered Holder as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date, based on our\nsecurities registry maintained at the transfer agent for our Common Stock and by our treasury department for the\nWarrants. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through a brokerage account, bank or other nominee, you will\nnot receive an actual Rights Certificate. Instead, as described in this prospectus, you must instruct your broker, bank\nor nominee whether or not to exercise Rights on your behalf.\nQ: May I sell, transfer or assign my Rights?\nA: No. You may not transfer, sell or assign any of your Rights, except that Rights will be transferable by\noperation of law (e.g., by death) or by such holders that are closed-end funds to funds affiliated with such Holder.\nFor purposes of any such transfer by a closed-end fund, \"affiliated” means each other funds that owns or controls\ndirectly or indirectly the holder and any fund that controls or is controlled by or is under common control with the\nholder. The Rights are non-transferable (other than pursuant to the foregoing exceptions) and will not be listed on\nany securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system. Therefore, there will be no market for the\nRights.\nQ: Will I be able to trade my Rights on the Nasdaq?\nA: No.\nQ: Am I required to subscribe in the Rights Offering?\nA: No.\nQ: Am I required to exercise any or all of the Rights I receive in the Rights Offering?\nA: No. You may exercise any number of your Rights, or you may choose not to exercise any Rights. If you do\nnot exercise any Rights, the number of shares of our Common Stock that you own will not change.\nQ: Is the Company requiring a minimum subscription to complete the Rights Offering?\nA: No. We may choose to consummate, amend, extend or terminate the Rights Offering regardless of the\nnumber of shares of common stock actually subscribed for by stockholders.\nQ: Can the Financing Committee amend or extend the Rights Offering?\nA: Yes. Our Financing Committee may amend the terms or conditions of the Rights or the Rights Offering or\nextend the subscription period of the Rights or the Rights Offering, subject to the terms and conditions of the PIPE\nPurchase Agreements and the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment.\nQ: Can the Financing Committee cancel or terminate the Rights Offering?\nA: Yes, provided that the cancellation or termination of the Rights or the Rights Offering before the expiration\nof the Rights Offering would require the approval of the counterparties to the PIPE Purchase Agreements and the\nThird M&T Credit Agreement Amendment. If the Rights Offering is cancelled or terminated, we will issue a press\nrelease notifying Holders of the cancellation or termination, and any money received from subscribing Holders will be\npromptly returned, without interest or deduction.\nQ: Will my percentage ownership interest in the Company be diluted by the Rights Offering?\nA: Your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent that you do not exercise your Rights or purchase your\nratable portion of the shares of our Common Stock issued in the Rights Offering.\nAs a result of the Rights Offering, to the extent you do not exercise your Rights, you will lose any value\nrepresented by your unexercised Rights and the percentage that your original shares of Common Stock represent of\nour increased equity will be diluted.\nSee \"Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Rights Offering — If you do not exercise your Rights in full, your\npercentage ownership and voting rights will experience enhanced dilution.”\nx\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ: If I exercise Rights in the Rights Offering, may I cancel or change my decision?\nA: No. Unless our Financing Committee cancels or terminates the Rights Offering, all exercises of Rights are\nirrevocable. You should not exercise your Rights unless you are certain that you wish to purchase shares of Common\nStock at a price of $1.03 per share. If you request and pay for more shares of Common Stock than are allocated to you\nafter all adjustments have been effected, we will refund the overpayment, without interest or deduction. See \"Risk\nFactors — Risks Related to the Rights Offering — There may be material developments regarding us during the\nsubscription period”. In considering whether to exercise your Rights, you should consider that all exercises of Rights\nare irrevocable, even if you subsequently learn information about us that you consider to be unfavorable.”\nQ: How much money will the Company receive from the Rights Offering?\nA: Assuming the Rights Offering is fully subscribed, we expect to receive aggregate net proceeds from this\noffering of approximately $[•], after deducting estimated offering expenses incurred by us relating to the Rights\nOffering. Our expectation is to use the proceeds from the Rights Offering for working capital and general corporate\npurposes, including repayment of indebtedness, consistent with the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment and\nour business plan. We intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include\nbusiness development activities, funding potential future cash needs or operating losses or funding working capital\nand capital expenditure needs.\nFor more information regarding the net proceeds to the Company in the Rights Offering, please refer to the\nsection titled \"Use of Proceeds.”\nQ: Are there risks in exercising my Rights?\nA: Yes. The exercise of your Rights involves risks. Exercising your Rights means buying shares of our\nCommon Stock, and should be considered as carefully as you would consider any other equity investment. We urge\nyou to carefully read the section titled \"Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 of this prospectus and the section titled\n\"Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, and all\nother information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus in its entirety before you decide whether\nto exercise your Rights.\nQ: How many shares of Common Stock will be outstanding immediately after the Rights Offering?\nA: As of November 15, 2024, we had 59,939,113 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.\nThe number of shares of our Common Stock that will be outstanding after the Rights Offering will depend on the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock that are purchased in the Rights Offering. Assuming that 49,866,710 shares of\nCommon Stock are issued in a second series of exchanges under the Exchange Agreements prior to consummation of\nthe Rights Offering and assuming all offered shares of Common Stock are sold in the Rights Offering at the\nsubscription price, we will issue 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock. In that case, we will have approximately\n144,572,198 shares of Common Stock outstanding after the Rights Offering, including, on a fully diluted basis, the\npre-funded warrants for 300,357 shares of Common Stock and warrants issued to clients of CCM to purchase shares\nof our common stock at a current exercise price of $3.83 per share (the \"CCM Warrants”) having been converted into\n10,194,174 shares of Common Stock. In addition, if the closing of the Camping World Stock Sale occurs prior to the\nconclusion of the Rights Offering, we would have an additional 9,708,737 shares of Common Stock outstanding after\nthe Rights Offering. This would represent an increase of approximately 40.5% in the number of outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock as compared to immediately prior to the consummation of the Rights Offering.\nThe issuance of shares of our Common Stock in the Rights Offering will dilute, and thereby reduce, your\nproportionate ownership in our shares of Common Stock, unless you fully exercise your Basic Subscription Rights.\nSee \"Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Rights Offering — If you do not exercise your Rights in full, your\npercentage ownership and voting rights will experience enhanced dilution.” In addition, the issuance of our Common\nStock at a subscription price that is less than the market price as of the Record Date for the Rights Offering will likely\nreduce the price per share of our Common Stock held by you prior to the Rights Offering.\nQ. Is the Rights Offering similar to a forward stock split?\nA. No. These are completely different corporate actions. Among other differences between these actions, the\nnumbers of shares held by a stockholder is increased in a forward stock split by giving each stockholder an\nxi\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nadditional number of shares of Common Stock per each share held. For example, a 5-for-1 forward stock split would\ngive an additional four shares of Common Stock to each holder of record, such that each share held by the holder\nbefore the split would be five shares after the split. In contrast, no increase in shares held by any Holder will occur as\na result of the Rights Offering; rather, each Holder of record as of the Record Date will be entitled to purchase [3.05]\nshares of Common Stock for each Right received. If every Holder of record subscribes for the full number of shares\nunderlying their Rights, then the outstanding shares of the Company following the Rights Offering will look as if we\ncompleted a [4.05]-for-1 forward stock split. However, depending on the number of shares subscribed for in the\nRights Offering, our existing Holders may incur substantial dilution.\nQ. Is the Rights Offering similar to a reverse stock split?\nA. No. These are completely different corporate actions. Among other differences between these actions, the\nnumbers of shares held by a stockholder is reduced in a reverse stock split. No reduction in shares held by any\nHolder will occur as a result of the Rights Offering.\nQ: Will this Rights Offering result in the Company \"going private” for purposes of Rule 13e-3 of the\nExchange Act?\nA: No. The Rights Offering is not a transaction or series of transactions which has either a reasonable\nlikelihood or a purpose or producing a \"going private effect” as specified in Rule 13e-3 of the Exchange Act. Given\nthe structure of the Rights Offering, as described in this prospectus, the Company will continue to be registered\npursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act and intends to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market following\ncompletion of the Rights Offering.\nQ: If the Rights Offering is not completed, will my subscription payment be refunded to me?\nA: Yes. The Subscription Agent will hold all funds it receives in a segregated bank account until completion of\nthe Rights Offering. If the Rights Offering is not completed, we will promptly instruct the Subscription Agent to\nreturn your payment in full. If you own shares in \"street name,” it may take longer for you to receive payment\nbecause the Subscription Agent will send the refund payment through DTC, which will allocate the funds to your\nbank or broker. Any funds returned will be returned without interest or deduction.\nQ: What should I do if I want to participate in the Rights Offering, but I am a stockholder with a foreign\naddress?\nA: If you are a Rights holder whose address is outside the United States, the Subscription Agent will not mail\nRights Certificates to you, and your Rights Certificates will be held by the Subscription Agent for your account until\nany instructions are received to exercise your Rights. To exercise your Rights, you must notify the Subscription\nAgent on or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024, which is five business days prior to the expiration\ndate for the Rights Offering, unless extended by us, and, if we so request, must establish to our satisfaction that you\nare permitted to exercise your Rights under applicable law. Any questions related to exercising Rights should be\ndirected to the Subscription Agent. If you do not follow these procedures prior to the expiration of the Rights\nOffering, your Rights will expire. We will decide all questions concerning the timeliness, validity, form and eligibility\nof the exercise of your Rights and any such determinations by us will be final and binding.\nThis Rights Offering is not being made in any state or other jurisdiction in which it would be unlawful to do so,\nnor are we selling to you, or accepting any offers from you to purchase, shares of Common Stock if you are a resident\nof any such state or other jurisdiction. If necessary, we may delay commencement of the Rights Offering in certain\nstates or other jurisdictions in order to comply with the securities law requirements of those states or other\njurisdictions. In addition, in certain circumstances, in order to comply with applicable state securities laws, we may\nnot be able to honor all Rights even if we have shares of Common Stock available. We do not anticipate that there\nwill be any changes in the Rights Offering, and we may, in our sole discretion, decline to make modifications to the\nterms of the Rights Offering requested by regulators in states or other jurisdictions, in which case Holders who live in\nthose states or other jurisdictions will not be eligible to participate in the Rights Offering.\nxii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ: What are the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of receiving or exercising\nRights?\nA: Although the authorities governing transactions such as the Rights Offering are complex and unclear in\ncertain respects (including with respect to the effects of the Over-Subscription Right), we believe and intend to take\nthe position that a holder’s receipt of Rights pursuant to the Rights Offering may be treated as a taxable distribution\nwith respect to such holder’s existing shares of Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock received\npursuant to the exchange or conversion of all Series A Preferred Stock prior to the Record Date) and should not be\ntaxable with respect to such holder’s Series A Preferred Stock and Warrants for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis position regarding the non-taxable treatment of the Rights Offering is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue\nService (the \"IRS”) or the courts. For a more detailed discussion, see \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences.” You should consult your tax advisor as to the particular considerations applicable to you of the\nRights Offering.\nQ: To whom should I send my forms and payment?\nA: If your shares are held in the name of a custodian bank, broker, dealer or other nominee, the nominee will\nnotify you of the Rights Offering and provide you with the Rights Offering materials. You should send any required\ndocuments and payment, as provided therein to the nominee, at the deadline that your nominee sets which may be\nearlier than the expiration of the Rights Offering. You should contact your custodian bank, broker, dealer or other\nnominee if you believe you are entitled to participate in the Rights Offering but you have not received your materials.\nSubject to the above instructions applicable to a Rights holder whose address is outside the United States, if\nyour shares are held in your name such that you are the record holder, then you should send your subscription\ndocuments, Rights Certificate and subscription payment, as provided herein, by first class mail or courier service to\nthe Subscription Agent.

You, or, if applicable, your nominee, are solely responsible for ensuring the Subscription Agent receives\nyour subscription documents, Rights Certificate, and subscription payment. You should allow sufficient time for\ndelivery of your subscription materials to the Subscription Agent and clearance of payment before the expiration of\nthe Rights Offering period.\nQ: What should I do if I have other questions?\nA: If you have questions or need assistance, please contact the Information Agent toll-free at 888-789-8409, by\ne-mail at shareholder@broadridge.com, or by mail at:\nBroadridge, Inc.\nAttn: BCIS Re-Organization Dept.\nP.O.

This summary is not complete and does not contain all of the information that you should\nconsider before deciding whether to invest in our Common Stock. For a more complete understanding of the\nCompany and this Rights Offering, we encourage you to read and consider the more detailed information included or\nincorporated by reference in this prospectus, including risk factors, see \"Risk Factors” beginning on page 18, and our\nmost recent consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nOverview\nWe have operated recreational vehicle (\"RV”) dealerships that offer new and pre-owned RVs and sell related\nparts and accessories since 1976. We became a publicly traded company March 15, 2018 following a business\ncombination with Andina Acquisition Corp. II. We arrange financing and extended service contracts for vehicle sales\nthrough third-party financing sources and extended warranty providers.\nOur Business\nWe operate RV dealerships and offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for RV owners and\noutdoor enthusiasts. We generate revenue by providing RV owners and outdoor enthusiasts a full spectrum of\nproducts: RV sales, RV repair and services, financing and insurance products, third-party protection plans, and after-\nmarket parts and accessories.\nWe operate 23 dealerships in 14 states, although we expect to sell seven dealerships and reduce the number of\nour states of operation to nine (see \"Recent Developments” below). Based on industry research and management’s\nestimates, we believe we operate the world’s largest RV dealership, measured in terms of on-site inventory, located\non approximately 126 acres outside Tampa, Florida.\nLazydays offers one of the largest selections of leading RV brands in the nation, featuring more than 4,250 new\nand pre-owned RVs. We have more than 400 service bays, and each location has an RV parts and accessories store.\nWe employ approximately 1,300 people at our 23 dealership locations. Our locations are staffed with knowledgeable\nlocal team members, providing customers access to extensive RV expertise. We believe our locations are strategically\nlocated and, based on information collected by us from reports prepared by Statistical Surveys, account for a\nsignificant portion of new RV units sold on an annual basis in the U.S. Our dealerships attract customers from all\nstates, except Hawaii.\nWe attract new customers primarily through Lazydays dealership locations as well as digital and traditional\nmarketing efforts. Once we acquire customers, those customers become part of our customer database where we use\ncustomer relationship management tools and analytics to actively engage, market and sell our products and services.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 4042 Park Oaks Boulevard, Suite 350, Tampa, Florida 33610 and our\ntelephone number is (813) 246-4999. Our Internet website is www.lazydays.com. Our reports filed or furnished\npursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”), are\navailable, free of charge, under the Investor Relations – Finance Information tab of our website as soon as\nreasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The SEC also maintains\nan Internet website located at www.sec.gov that contains the information we file or furnish electronically with the\nSEC. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and you should not\nconsider it a part of this prospectus.\nLeveraging Our Scale and Cost Structure to Create Operational Efficiencies\nAs we grow, we are positioned to leverage our scale to improve operating margins. We have centralized many\nadministrative functions to drive efficiencies and streamline store-level operations. The reduction of administrative\nfunctions at our stores allows our local teams to focus on customer-facing opportunities to increase revenues and\ngross profit. Our stores also receive supply chain management support, ensuring optimal levels of new and used RV\ninventory; and finance and insurance product and training support to provide a full array of offerings to our\ncustomers.\n1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRecent Developments\nWaller Real Estate Purchase Agreement\nOn October 10, 2024, we entered into a Real Estate Purchase Agreement with McGhee RV Properties, LP, a Texas\nlimited partnership, as purchaser (the \"Waller Purchase Agreement”), which provides for the sale of certain land and\nimprovements of the previously closed Waller, Texas dealership for proceeds of $8.0 million.\nPurchase Agreements with Camping World\nOn November 15, 2024, certain of our indirect subsidiaries (\"Sellers”) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement\n(the \"Asset Purchase Agreement”) by and among Sellers, the Company, as Guarantor, and certain subsidiaries of\nCamping World Holdings, Inc. (collectively, \"Camping World”), pursuant to which Sellers agreed to sell all of the\nassets (the \"Purchased Assets”) contributing to the operation of Sellers’ recreational vehicle sales and service\nbusiness operated out of Sellers’ facilities in Elkhart, Indiana, Surprise, Arizona, Murfreesboro, Tennessee,\nSturtevant, Wisconsin, Council Bluffs, Iowa, Portland, Oregon, and Woodland, Washington (the \"Business”) to\nCamping World (the \"Asset Sale”) for approximately $7 million (plus further cash for RV inventory and service work\nin process at closing), subject to certain adjustments and the terms and conditions set forth therein.\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants related to the\nBusiness and the Asset Sale. Between the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the final closing of the Asset\nSale, Asset Sellers have agreed to operate the Business in the ordinary course of business and to certain other\noperating covenants with respect to the Business as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Asset Sale may\nhave staggered closings, with each facility being sold at different times when requisite closing conditions have been\nsatisfied.\nUnder the Asset Purchase Agreement, CWGS Ventures, LLC, an affiliate of Camping World (the \"CW\nInvestor”), provided the Company a $10 million nonrefundable deposit in exchange for the Company’s obligation to\nissue 9,708,737 shares (the \"APA Shares”) of its common stock, par value $0.0001 (the \"Common Stock”), to the CW\nInvestor upon final closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement. Such number of\nshares equals $10 million divided by $1.03, which was the Minimum Price as defined in Nasdaq Rule 5635(d).\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement also provides for a 30-day inspection period for Camping World to inspect the\nassets and gives Camping World the right to terminate the agreement if certain material items are discovered. In\naddition, the Asset Purchase Agreement may be terminated prior to the final closing of the Asset Sale (i) by mutual\nwritten consent of the parties, (ii) by the non-breaching party upon certain uncured material breaches of the Asset\nPurchase Agreement by the other party, (iii) by either Asset Sellers or Camping World in the case of certain\ngovernmental actions prohibiting the Transaction, (iv) by either Asset Sellers or Camping World in the event that the\nReal Estate Purchase Agreement (as defined below) terminates in accordance with its terms, or (v) by either Asset\nSellers or Camping World if any of the conditions to the closing of the Asset Sale are not satisfied on or before\nMarch 31, 2025.\nAlso on November 15, 2024, certain other indirect subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, \"Real Estate\nSeller”), entered into a Real Estate Purchase Agreement (the \"Real Estate Purchase Agreement” and together with the\nAsset Purchase Agreement, the \"CW Purchase Agreements”), with certain subsidiaries of Camping World Holding,\nInc. (collectively, \"Real Estate Buyer”). Pursuant to the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, Real Estate Buyer has\nagreed to purchase certain of the Real Estate Seller’s properties located in Elkhart, Indiana, Surprise, Arizona and\nMurfreesboro, Tennessee (the \"Properties”) for approximately $48.5 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments\nand the terms and conditions set forth therein. The purchase and sale of the Properties is subject to a 30-day\ninspection period for the Real Estate Purchaser to perform inspections of the Properties and gives the Real Estate\nPurchaser the right to terminate the agreement if certain material items are discovered.\nThe Real Estate Purchase Agreement will terminate automatically in the event that the Asset Purchase\nAgreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.\nPursuant to the CW Purchase Agreements, the Company will use a portion of the proceeds of the transactions\ncontemplated by the CW Purchase Agreements for the repayment of any indebtedness secured by the Purchased\nAssets and the Properties.\n2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe foregoing descriptions of the CW Purchase Agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full\ntext of such agreements, copies of which were filed as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, to our Current Report on\nForm 8-K filed on November 18, 2024, and each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

Pursuant to the\nRegistration Rights Agreement, the Company is required to prepare and file, on or before December 16, 2024, a\nregistration statement covering the resale of the PIPE Shares issued to the Alta PIPE Purchasers for an offering to be\nmade on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities\nAct”). The Registration Rights Agreement also provides that the Company will bear the expenses relating to such\nregistration and indemnify the registration rights holders against certain liabilities which may arise under the\nSecurities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”), or state securities laws.\nUnder the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement\nwith Camping World on substantially the same terms as the Registration Rights Agreement when the APA Shares are\nissued.\nThe foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full\ntext of such agreement, the form of which was filed as Exhibit 10.3 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on\nNovember 18, 2024, and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.\n3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreferred Stock Exchange Agreements\nOn November 15, 2024, the Company entered into Preferred Stock Exchange Agreements (the \"Exchange\nAgreements”) with the holders (the \"Preferred Holders”) of the Company’s outstanding Series A Convertible\nPreferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \"Series A Preferred Stock”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements,\nthe Preferred Holders agreed to exchange 600,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 66,488,948 shares of Common\nStock (the \"Exchange Shares”) in consideration for the termination of the rights associated with the Series A\nPreferred Stock and the resulting loss of the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock of approximately\n$68.5 million, a value of $1.03 per share of Common Stock received in the exchange. Approximately 150,000 shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock and 16,622,238 Exchange Shares were exchanged and issued, respectively, on November 15,\n2024, with the balance to be automatically exchanged and issued when the Company files an amendment to its\nCertificate of Incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock necessary to accommodate\nthe exchange of the full amount of the Series A Preferred Stock to Common Stock (the \"Charter Amendment”). The\nnecessary stockholders approved the Charter Amendment by written consent on November 15, 2024, and the Charter\nAmendment will be filed as soon as permitted after the filing of an information statement and required waiting period\npursuant to Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act. The Company expects the Charter Amendment filing and the\nsubsequent issuance of 49,866,710 Exchange Shares in the second series of exchanges under the Exchange\nAgreements will occur prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement of which the prospectus forms a part.\nThe Exchange Agreements contain customary representations and warranties and covenants for a transaction of\nthis type.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Exchange Agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text\nof such agreements, the form of which was filed as Exhibit 10.4 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November\n18, 2024, and each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The representations, warranties and\ncovenants contained in such agreements were made only for purposes of such agreements and as of specific dates,\nwere solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the\ncontracting parties.\nWaiver and Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment\nOn November 15, 2024, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Third Amendment to the Second\nAmended and Restated Credit Agreement and Consent (the \"Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment”), with\nManufacturers and Traders Trust Company (\"M&T”), as Administrative Agent, and the lenders party to the\nCompany’s syndicated, senior secured credit agreement (the \"M&T Credit Agreement”) with M&T. The M&T Credit\nAgreement provides us with a floor plan credit facility (the \"Floor Plan Credit Facility”) and a revolving credit facility\n(the \"Revolving Credit Facility”).\nThe Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment grants the Company waivers of specified defaults and events of\ndefault that occurred under the M&T Credit Agreement, including events of default resulting from:\n• its inability to comply with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant with respect to June, July, August,\nSeptember and October 2024;\n• its inability to comply with the minimum liquidity financial covenant for July, August, September and\nOctober 2024;\n• its inability to comply with the minimum current ratio financial covenant for the fiscal quarters ended June\n30, 2024 and September 30, 2024;\n• the filing of certain mechanic’s, materialmen’s, construction or similar liens against certain of the\nCompany’s real property, relating to its failure to pay for certain improvements made thereto; and\n• certain cross-defaults under the Company’s term loan agreement with Coliseum Holdings I, LLC, as lender\n(the \"Coliseum Lender”) and the Company’s mortgages with First Horizon Bank relating to the foregoing.\nUnder the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the lenders’ aggregate commitment under the Floorplan\nFacility decreased from $400 million to (a) $325 million, from the date of the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment\nthrough the date (the \"Asset Sale Outside Date”) that is 60 days after the final closing of the asset sales under the\nCW Purchase Agreements described above (the \"Camping World Asset Sales”), and\n4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(b) $295 million, thereafter through the maturity date, provided that until the Asset Sale Outside Date, the Company\nmay borrow up to an additional $10 million in floor plan loans (the \"Floor Plan Overlimit Loans”), subject to the\nsatisfaction of certain conditions. To the extent the Company borrows Floor Plan Overlimit Loans, the Company\nagreed to pay the lenders a per annum fee equal to 2.00% of the average daily aggregate principal amount thereof.\nThe Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment eliminates testing of the total net leverage ratio, current ratio and\nminimum EBITDA financial covenants until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2026, and the Third M&T Credit\nAgreement Amendment eliminates testing of the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant until the fiscal quarter\nending September 30, 2026. The Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment also changes the required performance\ntargets for compliance with all of the Company’s financial covenants.\nThe Company also agreed in the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, among other changes:\n• to permanently eliminate its ability to borrow new loans or swingline loans or to request issuance of letters\nof credit under the Revolving Credit Facility;\n• to make certain mandatory repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility, including the following:\n○ on the date of the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, in the amount of $10 million;\n○ beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025 and on the last day of each quarter thereafter,\nin the amount of $2.5 million each quarter;\n○ on the date that is two business days after completion of this Rights Offering, in the amount of 50% of\nthe proceeds thereof; and\n○ repayments from time to time in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds (less certain costs, fees\nand expenses and after repayment of any indebtedness required to be repaid in connection therewith)\nreceived from any sale or refinancing of the Company’s real estate, excluding real property to be sold\nin the Camping World Asset Sales and certain real property located in Waller, Texas that the Company\nis attempting to sell;\n• to deliver to the Administrative Agent second-lien mortgages, which will secure the Company’s remaining\nobligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, on all of the Company’s real property that is currently\nmortgaged to the Coliseum Lender, except for real property to be sold in the Camping World Asset Sales\nand certain real property located in Waller, Texas that the Company is attempting to sell;\n• until March 31, 2025, to continue engaging CR3 Partners as the Company’s financial advisor, and to\ncontinue engaging CR3 Partners (or an employee thereof) as the Company’s interim chief financial officer\nuntil a permanent chief financial officer reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent is selected and\napproved by the Company’s board of directors;\n• to additional restrictions on investments, indebtedness, dividends and other restricted payments,\ntransactions with affiliates and acquisitions; and\n• to replace the leverage-based pricing grid from the M&T Credit Agreement with a fixed margin over SOFR\nor the Base Rate (as applicable), described further below.\nAfter giving effect to the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the Floor Plan Credit Facility bears interest\nat (a) one-month term SOFR or daily SOFR plus 2.55% or (b) the Base Rate plus 1.55%, and the Revolving Credit\nFacility bears interest at (x) one-month term SOFR or daily SOFR plus an applicable margin of 3.40% or (b) the Base\nRate plus a margin of 2.40%. After giving effect to the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment and the repayment\nof a portion of the principal amount thereof described above, the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility\nis $31.0 million.\nUnder the terms of the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, if the Company fails to consummate all of the\nCamping World Asset Sales on or before March 31, 2025, or if it terminates the CW Purchase Agreements before\nconsummation of those sales, it will constitute an event of default under the M&T Credit Agreement.\nThe foregoing description of the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.5, to our Current Report on Form\n8-K filed on November 18, 2024, and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.\n5\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCharter Amendment\nThe Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Certificate of Incorporation”)\nauthorizes the issuance of a maximum of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock. As of November 11, 2024, there were\n14,190,663 shares of Common Stock outstanding. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the PIPE\nPurchase Agreements, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Exchange Agreements will result in the issuance of\n105,323,897 shares of Common Stock, and a maximum of 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock may be issued in the\nRights Offering. In addition, the Company must maintain a number of authorized but unissued shares of Common\nStock to reserve for the total number into which its outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible,\nthe total number for which its outstanding warrants to purchase Common Stock are exercisable and the total number\nof shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with equity awards. In order to accommodate these issuances and\nshare reserve requirements, and allow for other future issuances as approved by the Company’s board of directors\n(and, if required, the Company’s stockholders), stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the\nCompany’s stockholders approved and adopted the Charter Amendment on November 15, 2024, which is an\namendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of Common Stock the Company is\nauthorized to issue from 100,000,000 to 500,000,000.\nThe Company expects that, prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement of which the prospectus\nforms a part, (i) the Charter Amendment will have been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State and become\neffective and (ii) in connection with the effectiveness of the Charter Amendment, an aggregate of 449,999 shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock will have been exchanged for an aggregate of 49,866,710 shares of Common Stock in a\nsecond series of exchanges under the Exchange Agreements.\n6\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial\nstatements (\"Pro Forma Information”) in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X.

The pro forma impact on cash and cash equivalents is as follows (in\nthousands):\nCash Proceeds from sale of Common Stock $30,000\nLess: Payment on revolving line of credit (10,000)\nLess: Payment of estimated transaction costs (1,829)\nNet Cash Proceeds $18,171\n(j) Adjustment reflects the exchange of 600,000 shares of Preferred Stock for 66,488,948 shares of Common Stock\n(the \"Exchange Shares”) in consideration for the termination of the rights associated with the Preferred Stock,\ndividend rights and the resulting loss of the liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock of approximately $68.5\nmillion, a value of $1.03 per share of Common Stock received in the exchange.\n(k) Adjustments reflect the elimination of revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and taxes which are specific to the\noperations of the Businesses.\n(l) Adjustment reflects a reduction to interest expense as a result of the mandatory repayment of $39.0 million on\nthe term loan with Coliseum Holdings I, LLC from proceeds received from the sale of the Businesses and assets.\n(m) Reflects the estimated income tax impact of the adjustments at the statutory income tax rate during the periods\npresented. As the Company has recognized a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of September 30,\n3024, the income tax benefit that results from the estimated loss on disposal and transaction costs has been\nsimilarly adjusted with a valuation allowance.\n11\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE OFFERING\nRights We will distribute to holders of record of our Common\nStock and holders of our Warrants (in the case of the\nWarrants, on an as-converted basis), excluding the PIPE\nInvestors and affiliates thereof who have waived their\nrespective rights to such distribution, as of 5:00 p.m.,\nNew York City time, on [•], 2024, at no charge, one non-\ntransferable Right to purchase [3.05] shares of Common\nStock (as well as the right to purchase any additional\nshares pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right) at a\nsubscription price of $1.03 per whole share. You will\nreceive one Right for every share of Common Stock held\nor issuable upon exercise or conversion of Warrants held\nas of the Record Date.\nBasic Subscription Right Each Right includes a Basic Subscription Right that will\nallow Holders to purchase [3.05] shares of our Common\nStock at a subscription price of $1.03 per whole share.\nRights may only be exercised in whole numbers. After\naggregating all of the shares subscribed for by a\nparticular Holder, including shares subscribed for\npursuant to the Over-Subscription Right, any fractional\nshares of our Common Stock that would otherwise be\nissued upon the exercise of the Rights by that Holder will\nbe rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares\nfor purposes of determining the number of shares of our\nCommon Stock for which you may subscribe and may be\nissued upon the exercise of your Rights, with such\nadjustments as may be necessary to ensure that we offer\na maximum of 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock in the\nRights Offering.\nOver-Subscription Right Each Rights holder who elects to exercise the Basic\nSubscription Right in full may also subscribe for\nadditional shares at the same subscription price per\nshare. If an insufficient number of shares is available to\nfully satisfy the Over-Subscription Right requests, the\navailable shares will be allocated pro rata, after rounding\ndown any fractional shares that would otherwise be\nissued to the nearest whole number of shares, among\nRights holders who exercised their Over-Subscription\nRight based on the number of shares each Rights holder\nsubscribed for under the Basic Subscription Right. The\nSubscription Agent will return any excess payments,\nwithout interest or deduction, promptly after the\nexpiration of the Rights Offering. Only Record Date\nHolders who exercise in full all Rights issued to them are\nentitled to exercise the Over-Subscription Right.\nConditions to the Rights Offering Your right to exercise your Rights is subject to the\nconditions described under \"The Rights Offering –\nConditions to the Rights Offering.” The Financing\nCommittee has authority to approve any additional\namendments or modifications of the terms or\n12\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconditions of the Rights or the Rights Offering, subject\nto the terms and conditions of the PIPE Purchase\nAgreements and the Third M&T Credit Agreement\nAmendment.\nSubscription Price $1.03 per share.\nRecord Date [•], 2024.\nExpiration Date The Rights will expire, if not exercised, at 5:00 p.m., New\nYork City time, on [•], 2024, unless extended by us, in our\nsole discretion. Any Rights not exercised at or before\nthat time will expire without any payment to the holders\nof those unexercised Rights. Please note that if you hold\nyour shares in \"street name” through a broker, dealer, or\nother nominee who uses the services of DTC, DTC must\nreceive the subscription instructions, Notice of\nGuaranteed Delivery (if applicable), and payment for the\nnew shares before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the\nexpiration date. See \"The Rights Offering – Procedures\nfor DTC Participants.”\nWaiver of Right to Receive Distribution of\nRights Pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreements, the PIPE\nInvestors and their respective affiliates have irrevocably\nwaived their respective rights to receive the distribution\nof the Rights or otherwise participate in the Rights\nOffering to the extent they hold our securities as of the\nRecord Date. Prior to the closing of this Rights Offering,\nassuming the exchange of all shares of Series A Preferred\nStock pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, (i) the\nCCM PIPE Purchasers and their affiliates, including\nthrough investment funds and clients CCM manages, are\nthe beneficial owners of approximately 72.2% of our\nCommon Stock and (ii) the Alta Purchasers and their\naffiliates are the beneficial owners of approximately\n13.3% of our Common Stock. See \"Prospectus Summary\n—Recent Developments.”\nNon-Transferability of Rights The Rights may not be sold, transferred, assigned or\ngiven away to anyone, except that Rights will be\ntransferable by operation of law (e.g., by death) or by\nsuch holders that are closed-end funds to funds\naffiliated with such holders. The Rights will not be listed\nfor trading on any stock exchange or market.\nExtension, cancellation, and amendment We may extend the period for exercising your Rights in\nour sole discretion. We may cancel or terminate the\nRights or the Rights Offering on or before the expiration\nof the Rights Offering, provided that the cancellation or\ntermination of the Rights or the Rights Offering before\nthe expiration of the Rights Offering would require the\napproval of the counterparties to the PIPE Purchase\nAgreements and the Third M&T Credit Agreement\nAmendment. In the event that the Rights Offering is\ncancelled or terminated, all funds received\n13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfrom subscriptions by Holders will be returned. Interest\nwill not be payable on any returned funds. We also\nreserve the right, by action of the Financing Committee,\nto amend the terms and conditions of the Rights or the\nRights Offering or to otherwise modify the terms or\nconditions of the Rights or the Rights Offering, subject\nto the terms and conditions of the PIPE Purchase\nAgreements and the Third M&T Credit Agreement\nAmendment.\nProcedure for Exercising Rights by\nU.S. Holders If you are the record holder of shares of our Common\nStock or Warrants, to exercise your Rights you must\ncomplete the Rights Certificate and deliver it to the\nSubscription Agent together with full payment for all the\nRights you elect to exercise. The Subscription Agent\nmust receive the proper forms and payments on or before\n5:00 p.m. New York City time on the expiration date of the\nRights Offering. You may deliver the documents by first\nclass mail, express mail, courier or other expedited service\nand payments by wire transfer of immediately available\nfunds or certified bank or cashier’s check drawn upon a\nUnited States bank payable to the Subscription Agent. If\nregular mail is used for this purpose, we recommend\nusing registered mail, properly insured, with return\nreceipt requested.\nOnce you have exercised the Basic Subscription Right\nand, if elected, the Over-Subscription Right, your\nexercise may not be revoked. You should not exercise\nyour Rights unless you are certain that you wish to\npurchase Common Stock in the Rights Offering. See\n\"Summary — Recent Developments” and \"Risk Factors\n— Risks Related to the Rights Offering — There may be\nmaterial developments regarding us during the\nsubscription period. In considering whether to exercise\nyour Rights, you should consider that all exercises of\nRights are irrevocable, even if you subsequently learn\ninformation about us that you consider to be\nunfavorable.”\nIf you wish to exercise Rights, but you do not have\nsufficient time to deliver the Rights Certificate\nevidencing your Rights to the Subscription Agent on or\nbefore the time your Rights expire, you may exercise your\nRights by exercising a Notice of Guaranteed Delivery (as\ndescribed herein). See \"The Rights Offering —\nGuaranteed Delivery Procedures.”\nRights not exercised prior to the expiration of the Rights\nOffering will lose their value.\nHow Rights Holders Can Exercise Rights Through\nOthers Please note that if you hold your securities in \"street\nname” through a broker, dealer, or other nominee who\nuses the services of DTC, DTC must receive the\nsubscription instructions, Notice of Guaranteed\n14\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDelivery (if applicable), and payment for the new shares\nbefore 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration\ndate. See \"The Rights Offering — Procedures for DTC\nParticipants.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of\nour Common Stock, you should instruct your broker,\ncustodian bank or nominee in accordance with the\nprocedures described in the section of this prospectus\ntitled \"The Rights Offering — Beneficial Owners.”\nHow Non-U.S. Holders Can Exercise Rights The Subscription Agent will not mail Rights Certificates\nto you if you are a Holder whose address is outside the\nUnited States, and your Rights Certificates will be held\nby the Subscription Agent for your account until any\ninstructions are received to exercise your Rights. If you\nare a Holder whose address is outside the United States,\nto exercise your Rights, you must notify the Subscription\nAgent on or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on\n[•], 2024, which is five business days prior to the\nexpiration date for the Rights Offering, unless extended\nby us, and, if we so request, must establish to our\nsatisfaction that you are permitted to exercise your\nRights under applicable law. Any questions related to\nexercising Rights should be directed to the Subscription\nAgent. If you do not follow these procedures prior to the\nexpiration of the Rights Offering, your Rights will expire.\nWe will decide all questions concerning the timeliness,\nvalidity, form and eligibility of the exercise of your Rights\nand any such determinations by us will be final and\nbinding.\nNo Revocation All exercises of Rights are irrevocable. No exercise may\nbe revoked or changed and no refunds will be paid. A\nHolder should not exercise its Rights unless certain that\nthe Holder wants to purchase shares of our Common\nStock in the Rights Offering at the subscription price set\nforth herein.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences Although the authorities governing transactions such as\nthe Rights Offering are complex and unclear in certain\nrespects (including with respect to the effects of the\nOver-Subscription Right and the participation in this\nRights Offering by holders of Warrants), we believe and\nintend to take the position that a U.S. Holder’s receipt of\nRights pursuant to the Rights Offering may be treated as\na taxable distribution with respect to such holder’s\nexisting shares of Common Stock and should not be\ntreated as a taxable distribution with respect to such\nholder’s Warrants for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis position regarding the non-taxable treatment of the\nRights Offering is not binding on the IRS or the courts.\nThe fair market value of the Rights would be taxable to\nU.S. Holders of our Common Stock as a dividend to the\nextent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of our current\nand accumulated earnings and profits, if any, with any\nexcess being treated as a\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreturn of capital to the extent thereof and then as capital\ngain. The Company believes that it may have current and\naccumulated earnings and profits through the end of\n2024. Further, if the Rights Offering is treated as a taxable\ndistribution, the treatment of holders of Warrants is not\nclear, and it may differ from, and may be more adverse\nthan, the treatment of the Rights distribution to the\nholders of Common Stock. For a more detailed\ndiscussion, including U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations applicable to Non-U.S. Holders, see\n\"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.” You\nshould consult your tax advisor as to the particular\nconsiderations applicable to you of the Rights Offering.\nIssuance of Our Common Stock Unless the Rights and Rights Offering are terminated, we\nwill issue shares purchased in the Rights Offering as\nsoon as practicable after the expiration of the Rights\nOffering. All shares that are purchased in the Rights\nOffering will be issued in uncertificated book-entry form,\nmeaning that you will receive a direct registration\naccount statement from our transfer agent reflecting\nownership of these securities if you are a Holder of\nrecord. If you hold your shares in the name of a bank,\nbroker, dealer or other nominee, DTC will credit your\nnominee with the securities you purchased in the Rights\nOffering.\nPayment Adjustments Any payment that is insufficient to purchase the number\nof shares of our Common Stock requested, or if the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock requested is not\nspecified in the Rights Certificate, the Subscription\nAgent will have the right to reject and return your\nsubscription for correction. The Subscription Agent will\nreturn any excess funds without interest or a deduction\nwhere the payment exceeds the amount necessary for the\nfull exercise, including any Over-Subscription Right\nexercised.\nNo Board or Financing Committee Recommendation to\nRights Holders Neither the Company, the Financing Committee nor our\nBoard has, or will, make any recommendation to Holders\nwhether to exercise or let lapse their Rights in the Rights\nOffering. You should make an independent investment\ndecision about whether to exercise or let lapse your\nRights based on your own assessment of our business\nand the Rights Offering. Please see the section of this\nprospectus titled \"Risk Factors” for a discussion of some\nof the risks involved in investing in our Common Stock.\nNasdaq Symbol for Our Common Stock Our Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol\n\"GORV.” On [•], 2024, the last trading day before the date\nof this prospectus, the closing price of our Common\nStock on Nasdaq was $[•] per share.\nUse of Proceeds Assuming the Rights Offering is fully subscribed, we\nexpect to receive aggregate net proceeds from this\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\noffering of approximately $[•], after deducting $[•] of\nestimated offering expenses incurred by us relating to\nthe Rights Offering. Our expectation is to use the\nproceeds from the Rights Offering for working capital\nand general corporate purposes, including repayment of\nindebtedness, consistent with the Third M&T Credit\nAgreement Amendment and our business plan.

We urge you to\ncarefully read the section titled \"Risk Factors” beginning\non page 18 of this prospectus and the section titled\n\"Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended\nMarch 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024,\nand all other information included or incorporated by\nreference in the prospectus and this prospectus in its\nentirety before you decide whether to exercise your\nRights.\nImportant Dates to Remember Set forth below are certain important dates for this Rights\nOffering, which are generally subject to extension:\nRecord Date: [•], 2024.\nDeadline for Delivery of Notice of Guaranteed Delivery:\n5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024.\nDeadline for Delivery of Rights, Rights Certificates, and\npayment: 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024.\nExpiration Date: 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•],\n2024.\nAnticipated Delivery of Shares Purchased in Rights\nOffering, Unless Extended or Terminated: on or before\n[•], 2024.\nPlease note that if you hold your shares in \"street name”\nthrough a broker, dealer, or other nominee who uses the\nservices of DTC, DTC must receive the subscription\ninstructions, Notice of Guaranteed Delivery (if\napplicable), and payment for the new shares before 5:00\np.m., New York City time, on the expiration date. See\n\"The Rights Offering — Procedures for DTC\nParticipants.”\nFor additional information concerning the Rights and our Common Stock, see \"The Rights Offering” and\n\"Description of Our Capital Stock” below.\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider\nthe specific risks described below, the risks described under the caption \"Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly\nperiods ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, which are incorporated herein by reference, as\nwell as other risk factors described under the caption \"Risk Factors” included or incorporated by reference in the\nprospectus, including our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision.\nAny of the risks we describe below or in the information incorporated herein by reference could cause our\nbusiness, financial condition or operating results to suffer. The market price of our Common Stock could decline if\none or more of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events. You could lose all or part of your investment.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Some of the statements in this\nsection of the prospectus are forward-looking statements. For more information, see the sections of this prospectus\ntitled \"Incorporation of Information by Reference” and \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to the Rights Offering\nThe subscription price determined for this Rights Offering is not an indication of our value.\nThe subscription price was established by our Financing Committee based on several considerations including\nthe historical and current trading prices of our Common Stock, our need for liquidity, taking into account our strategic\ngrowth plans, and capital and other strategic and financing alternatives reasonably available to us. The subscription\nprice is not necessarily related to our book value, net worth or any other established criteria of value and may or may\nnot be considered the fair value of the Common Stock to be offered in the Rights Offering. The market price of our\nCommon Stock may decline during or after the Rights Offering, including below the applicable subscription price.\nAfter the date of this prospectus, our Common Stock may trade at prices above or below the subscription price, and\nyou may not be able to sell shares of our Common Stock purchased in the Rights Offering at a price equal to or\ngreater than the price you paid, or at all.\nThere may be material developments regarding us during the subscription period. In considering whether to\nexercise your Rights, you should consider that all exercises of Rights are irrevocable, even if you subsequently\nlearn information about us that you consider to be unfavorable.\nWe currently expect that the Rights will expire if they are not exercised at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•],\n2024, which we may extend in our sole discretion. As a result, there may be material developments regarding us\nduring such period. Because all exercises of Rights are irrevocable, you should therefore consider carefully whether\nyou wish to delay any exercise of your Rights until after our issuance of those results since we cannot provide any\nassurance currently with respect to their content.\nThe Rights Offering may cause the price of our Common Stock to decrease.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may decrease upon the consummation of the Rights Offering as a result\nof the issuance of an additional 24,271,844 shares of our Common Stock. Further, if a substantial number of Rights are\nexercised and the holders of the shares acquired in the Rights Offering choose to sell some or all of such shares of\nCommon Stock, the resulting sales could depress the market price of our Common Stock. As a result, the trading price\nof our Common Stock after the Rights Offering may be below the current trading price, and there can be no\nassurances that it is not below the price at which shares are offered for sale in the Rights Offering.\nThere is no guarantee that by the time the Rights Offering is completed, if at all, and the shares you purchase, if\nany, are delivered to you, the market price of our Common Stock will be above the subscription price. Further,\nbecause the exercise of your Rights is not expected to be revocable, you will not be able to revoke your exercise if\nthe market price decreases prior to the delivery of the shares until after they are delivered.\nThere is no guarantee that the subscription price will be lower than the market price of our Common Stock at the\ntime that the Rights Offering is completed, if at all, and the shares that you receive in the Rights Offering, if any, are\ndelivered. Further, because the exercise of your Rights is not expected to be revocable, you will not\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbe able to revoke your exercise if the market price decreases prior to the delivery of the shares until after they are\ndelivered to you. Accordingly, the subscription price may be above the prevailing market price by the time that the\nshares of Common Stock are purchased and delivered. This may be due, among other things, to sales by other\npurchasers of shares in the Rights Offering given the substantial number of shares of our Common Stock being\noffered in the Rights Offering.\nIf you exercise your Rights in the Rights Offering and the market price of the Common Stock falls below the\nsubscription price, then you will have committed to buy Common Stock in the Rights Offering at a price that is higher\nthan the market price. Moreover, we cannot assure you that you will ever be able to sell shares of Common Stock that\nyou received in the Rights Offering at a price equal to or greater than the subscription price. Until shares are issued\nto the record holder upon expiration of the Rights Offering, you may not be able to sell the shares of our Common\nStock that you receive in the Rights Offering.\nWe expect to issue shares of our Common Stock purchased in the Rights Offering as soon as practicable after\nexpiration of the Rights Offering. We will not pay interest on funds delivered to the Subscription Agent pursuant to\nthe exercise of Rights.\nIf the Rights Offering is consummated in full and you do not exercise your Rights in full, your percentage\nownership and voting rights will experience enhanced dilution.\nIf you choose not to exercise your Rights, you will retain your current number of shares of our Common Stock. If\nother Holders fully exercise their Rights or exercise a greater proportion of their Rights than you exercise, the\npercentage of our Common Stock owned by these other Holders will increase relative to your ownership percentage,\nand your voting and other rights in the Company will likewise be diluted.\nPursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreements, the PIPE Investors and their affiliates have irrevocably waived their\nrespective right to receive the distribution of the Rights or otherwise participate in the Rights Offering to the extent\nthey hold our securities as of the Record Date. Prior to the closing of this Rights Offering, assuming the exchange of\nall shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, (i) the CCM PIPE Purchasers and their\naffiliates, including through investment funds and clients CCM manages, are the beneficial owners of approximately\n72.2% of our Common Stock and (ii) the Alta Purchasers and their affiliates are the beneficial owners of approximately\n13.3% of our Common Stock. See \"Prospectus Summary—Recent Developments.”\nWe may decide not to continue with the Rights or the Rights Offering or to terminate the Rights Offering and\nreturn your subscription payments without interest.\nWe may decide not to continue with the Rights or the Rights Offering or to terminate the Rights Offering at any\ntime, provided that the cancellation or termination of the Rights or the Rights Offering before the expiration of the\nRights Offering would require the approval of the counterparties to the PIPE Purchase Agreements and the Third\nM&T Credit Agreement Amendment. We currently have no intention to terminate the Rights and the Rights Offering\nbut reserve the right to do so. If we elect to cancel or terminate the Rights Offering, we will not have any obligation\nwith respect to the Rights except to return, without interest, any subscription payments the Subscription Agent\nreceived from you.\nThe Rights are not transferable, and there is no market for the Rights.\nYou may not sell, transfer, assign or give away your Rights, except that Rights will be transferable by operation\nof law (e.g., by death) or by such holders that are closed-end funds to funds affiliated with such holders. Because the\nRights are non-transferable, there is no market or other means for you to directly realize any value associated with the\nRights. You must exercise the Rights to realize any potential value from your Rights.\nYou may not be able to resell any shares of our Common Stock that you receive pursuant to the exercise of Rights\nimmediately upon expiration of the Rights Offering period or be able to sell your shares at a price equal to or\ngreater than the subscription price.\nIf you exercise Rights, you may not be able to resell the common stock that you receive in the Rights Offering\nuntil you, or your custodian bank, broker, dealer or other nominee, if applicable, have received those shares.\nMoreover, you will have no rights as a stockholder of the shares you received in the Rights Offering until we issue\nthe shares to you. Although we will endeavor to issue the shares as soon as practicable after completion\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the Rights Offering, and after all necessary calculations have been completed, there may be a delay between the\nexpiration date of the Rights Offering and the time that the shares are issued. In addition, following the exercise of\nyour Rights, you may not be able to sell your Common Stock at a price equal to or greater than the subscription price.\nBecause no minimum subscription is required and because we do not have formal commitments from our\nstockholders for the entire amount we seek to raise pursuant to the Rights Offering, we cannot assure you of the\namount of proceeds that we will receive from the Rights Offering.\nNo minimum subscription is required for consummation of the Rights Offering. It is also possible that no Over-\nSubscription Rights will be exercised in connection with the Rights Offering. As a result, we cannot assure you of the\namount of proceeds that we will receive in the Rights Offering. Therefore, if you exercise all or any portion of your\nRights, but other Holders do not, we may not raise the desired amount of capital in the Rights Offering, the market\nprice of our Common Stock could be adversely impacted and we may find it necessary to pursue alternative means of\nfinancing, which may be dilutive to your investment.\nIf you do not act promptly and follow the subscription instructions, your attempt to exercise Rights may be\nrejected.\nHolders who desire to purchase shares of our Common Stock in the Rights Offering must act promptly to ensure\nthat all required forms and payments are actually received by the Subscription Agent before 5:00 p.m., New York City\ntime, on [•], 2024, the expiration date of the Rights Offering, unless extended by us, in our sole discretion. Please note\nthat if you hold your shares in \"street name” through a broker, dealer, or other nominee who uses the services of\nDTC, DTC must receive the subscription instructions, Notice of Guaranteed Delivery (if applicable), and payment for\nthe new shares before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration date. See \"The Rights Offering — Procedures\nfor DTC Participants.”\nWe will not be responsible if your broker, custodian or nominee fails to ensure that all required forms and\npayments are actually received by the Subscription Agent before the expiration date of the Rights Offering. If you fail\nto complete and sign the required subscription forms, send an incorrect payment amount or otherwise fail to follow\nthe subscription procedures that apply to your exercise in the Rights Offering, the Subscription Agent may,\ndepending on the circumstances, reject your subscription or accept it only to the extent of the payment received.\nNeither we nor the Subscription Agent undertake to contact you concerning an incomplete or incorrect subscription\nform or payment, nor are we under any obligation to correct such forms or payment. We have the sole discretion to\ndetermine whether a subscription exercise properly follows the subscription procedures.\nPursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreements, the PIPE Investors and their affiliates have irrevocably waived their\nrespective right to receive the distribution of the Rights or otherwise participate in the Rights Offering to the extent\nthey hold our securities as of the Record Date. Prior to the closing of this Rights Offering, assuming the exchange of\nall shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, (i) the CCM PIPE Purchasers and their\naffiliates, including through investment funds and clients CCM manages, are the beneficial owners of approximately\n50.2% of our Common Stock and (ii) the Alta Purchasers and their affiliates are the beneficial owners of approximately\n13.3% of our Common Stock. See \"Prospectus Summary—Recent Developments.”\nBy participating in the Rights Offering and executing a Rights Certificate, you are making binding and\nenforceable representations to the Company.\nBy signing the Rights Certificate and exercising its Rights, each Holder agrees, solely with respect to such\nHolder’s exercise of Rights in the Rights Offering, that we have the right to void and cancel (and treat as if never\nexercised) any exercise of Rights, and securities issued pursuant to an exercise of Rights, if any of the agreements,\nrepresentations or warranties of a subscriber in the Rights Certificate are false. In addition, we may decide not to\ncontinue with the Rights Offering or to terminate the Rights or the Rights Offering at any time, provided that the\ncancellation or termination of the Rights or the Rights Offering before the expiration of the Rights Offering would\nrequire the approval of the counterparties to the PIPE Purchase Agreements and the Third M&T Credit Agreement\nAmendment. We currently have no intention to terminate the Rights Offering but reserve the right to do so. If we\nelect to cancel or terminate the Rights and the Rights Offering, we will not have any obligation with respect to the\nRights except to return, without interest, any subscription payments the Subscription Agent received from you.\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf you exercise the Over-Subscription Right, you may not receive all of the Common Stock for which you\nsubscribe.\nExercise of the Over-Subscription Right will only be honored if and to the extent that the Basic Subscription\nRights have not been exercised in full. If sufficient shares of Common Stock are available, we will seek to honor your\nover-subscription request in full. If, however, over-subscription requests exceed the number of shares of Common\nStock available to be purchased pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right, we will allocate the available shares of\nCommon Stock proportionately among Holders who exercised their Over-Subscription Right based on the number of\nshares of Common Stock each Holder subscribed for under such Holder’s basic subscription rights. As a result, you\nmay not receive any or all of the shares of Common Stock for which you exercise your Over-Subscription Right. Only\nHolders of Common Stock and Warrants on the Record Date who exercise in full all Rights issued to them are entitled\nto exercise the Over-Subscription Right.\nAs soon as practicable after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024, the Subscription Agent will determine the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock that you may purchase, if any, pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right. If you\nhave properly exercised your Over-Subscription Right, we will issue the shares of Common Stock purchased in the\nRights Offering to the record holder as soon as practicable after the expiration date and after all allocations and\nadjustments have been effected. If you request and pay for more shares of Common Stock than are allocated to you,\nwe will refund the overpayment, without interest or deduction. In connection with the exercise of the Over-\nSubscription Right, custodian banks, brokers, dealers and other nominee holders of Rights who act on behalf of\nbeneficial owners will be required to certify to us and to the Subscription Agent as to the aggregate number of\nsubscription Rights exercised, and the number of shares of Common Stock requested through the Over-Subscription\nRight, by each beneficial owner on whose behalf the nominee holder is acting.\nYou will not receive interest on subscription funds, including any funds ultimately returned to you.\nYou will not earn any interest on your subscription funds while they are being held by the Subscription Agent\npending the closing of this Rights Offering. In addition, if we cancel or terminate the Rights or the Rights Offering,\nneither we nor the Subscription Agent will have any obligation with respect to the Rights except to return, without\ninterest, any subscription payments to you.\nWe will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this Rights Offering, which may include uses you\ndo not agree with.\nAssuming the Rights Offering is fully subscribed, we expect to receive aggregate net proceeds from this offering\nof approximately $[•], after deducting $[•] of estimated offering expenses incurred by us relating to the Rights\nOffering. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this Rights Offering, after deducting our offering\nexpenses for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, consistent with\nthe Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment and our business plan. For a more detailed discussion, see \"Use of\nProceeds.” Although we plan to use the net proceeds from this Rights Offering as described, we have not designated\nthe amount of net proceeds from this Rights Offering to be used for any specific purpose. We will have broad\ndiscretion in the use of the net proceeds. You will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the\napplication of the proceeds of this Rights Offering. The results and effectiveness of the use of proceeds are\nuncertain, and we could spend the proceeds in ways that you do not agree with or that do not improve our results of\noperations or enhance the value of our Common Stock.\nIn administering the Rights Offering, we will be relying on statements, representations and other information\nprovided to us by third parties.\nIn administering the exercising of Rights and the pro rating of Over-Subscription Rights in the Rights Offering,\nwe will rely on the accuracy of various statements and representations provided to us by brokers, dealers, holders of\nRights and other third parties. If these statements or representations are false or inaccurate, it may delay or otherwise\nnegatively affect our or the Subscription Agent’s ability to administer this Rights Offering in accordance with the\nterms and conditions described in this prospectus. We also have the right to void and cancel (and treat as if never\nexercised) any exercise of Rights, and securities issued pursuant to an exercise of Rights, if any of the agreements,\nrepresentations or warranties of a subscriber in the Rights Certificate are false.\n21\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe receipt of Rights may be treated as a taxable distribution to you.\nAlthough the authorities governing transactions such as the Rights Offering are complex and unclear in certain\nrespects (including with respect to the effects of the Over-Subscription Right and the participation in this Rights\nOffering by holders of Warrants), we believe and intend to take the position that a U.S. Holder’s receipt of Rights\npursuant to the Rights Offering may be treated as a taxable distribution with respect to such holder’s existing shares\nof Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock received pursuant to the exchange or conversion of all\nSeries A Preferred Stock prior to the Record Date) and should not be treated as a taxable distribution with respect to\nsuch holder’s Warrants for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This position regarding the non-taxable treatment of the\nRights Offering is not binding on the IRS or the courts. The fair market value of the Rights would be taxable to U.S.\nHolders of our Common Stock as a dividend to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of our current and\naccumulated earnings and profits, if any, with any excess being treated as a return of capital to the extent thereof and\nthen as capital gain. The Company believes that it may have current and accumulated earnings and profits through\nthe end of 2024. Further, if the Rights Offering is treated as a taxable distribution, the treatment of holders of\nWarrants is not clear, and it may differ from, and may be more adverse than, the treatment of the Rights distribution\nto the holders of Common Stock. For a more detailed discussion, including U.S. federal income tax considerations\napplicable to Non-U.S. Holders, see \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.” You should consult your tax\nadvisor as to the particular considerations applicable to you of the Rights Offering.\n22\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\nAlthough we cannot determine what the actual net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock in the Rights\nOffering will be until the Rights Offering is completed, assuming the Rights Offering is fully subscribed, we expect to\nreceive aggregate net proceeds from this offering of approximately $[•], after deducting $[•] of estimated offering\nexpenses incurred by us relating to the Rights Offering.\nWe expect to use the net proceeds from the Rights Offering for general corporate and operational purposes,\nincluding repayment of indebtedness, consistent with the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment and our\nbusiness plan.\nOur debt facilities currently consist of:\n• a syndicated, senior secured floorplan credit facility and revolving credit facility, evidenced by a Second\nAmended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended from time to time, the \"M&T Credit Agreement”)\nwith Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, as administrative agent (in such capacity, \"M&T”), which\nis secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our personal property;\n• a real estate-backed term loan, evidenced by a Loan Agreement (as amended from time to time, the \"CCM\nLoan Agreement”) with Coliseum Holdings I, LLC (the \"CCM Mortgage Lender”), a client of CCM, as\nlender, which is secured by all of our owned real estate except our owned real estate that is mortgaged\npursuant to the First Horizon Mortgages described below; and\n• two term loan agreements with First Horizon Bank, which are secured by certain owned real estate of ours\nthat is located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee (together, the \"First Horizon\nMortgages”).\nUnder the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, on the date that is two business days after completion of\nthe Rights Offering, the Company has agreed to make a mandatory repayment on the revolving credit facility in the\namount of 50% of the net proceeds from this offering.\nThe expected use of the net proceeds from this Rights Offering represents our intentions based upon our\ncurrent plans and business conditions and numerous factors, which could change as our plans and business\nconditions evolve. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the\nnet proceeds to be received upon the completion of this Rights Offering or the amounts that we will actually spend\non the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the use of these proceeds may\nvary significantly depending on numerous factors, including any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our\nmanagement will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this Rights Offering.\nPending the use of the proceeds from this Rights Offering, we may invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital\npreservation instruments, which may include all or a combination of short-term and long-term interest-bearing\ninstruments. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return.\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCAPITALIZATION\nThe following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and our capitalization as of September 30, 2024 on:\n• an actual basis;\n• a pro forma basis, to give effect to the issuance of 105,323,897 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the\nPIPE Purchase Agreements, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Exchange Agreements, which are not\ncovered by the Registration Statement of which this prospectus forms a part, after deducting estimated\nexpenses payable by us (updated estimates of offering expenses to be provided by amendment); and\n• a pro forma, as adjusted basis, to give effect to the issuance and sale of 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock\nin this Rights Offering and our receipt of the proceeds from this Rights Offering (based on the subscription\nprice), after deducting estimated offering expenses (updated estimates of offering expenses to be provided\nby amendment).\nThe pro forma information set forth below is illustrative only and will be adjusted based on the number of shares\nactually sold.

Our historical net tangible book value as of September 30, 2024, was\n$(5,877,000), or $(0.41) per share of our Common Stock. Net tangible book value per share is equal to our total net\ntangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less our total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of our\noutstanding Common Stock. Dilution per share equals the difference between the amount per share paid by\npurchasers of shares of our Common Stock in the Rights Offering and the net tangible book value per share of our\nCommon Stock immediately after the Rights Offering. Our pro forma net tangible book value as of September 30, 2024\nwas $19,123,000, or $0.50 per share, based on the total number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, assuming we complete the Rights Offering and after giving effect to the issuance and sale of\n24,271,844 shares of Common Stock in this Rights Offering and our receipt of the proceeds from this Rights Offering\n(based on the subscription price), after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately $0 (updated estimates\nof offering expenses and net proceeds to be provided by amendment).\nThe following table illustrates the per-share dilution on a pro forma basis, on the assumptions and after giving\neffect to the adjustments described above.\nSubscription price $25,000,000\nNet tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2024 $(0.41)\nPro forma net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2024 0.50\nIncrease in pro forma net tangible book value per share 0.91\nDilution in net tangible book value per share to stockholders participating in this offering —\nWe intend to complete the Rights Offering on or before [•], 2024, unless our Financing Committee elects to\nextend or terminate the Rights or the Rights Offering, subject to the terms and conditions of the PIPE Purchase\nAgreements and the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment. The estimated net proceeds we will receive from the\nRights Offering, after the payment of $0 of estimated expenses of the Rights Offering, will be $25,000,000, on a pro\nforma basis (to be updated by amendment).\nThe information above is as of September 30, 2024 and excludes the following:\n• 66,488,948 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exchange of 600,000 shares of Series A Preferred\nStock pursuant to the Exchange Agreements;\n• 29,126,212 shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the PIPE Purchase Agreements; and\n• 9,708,737 shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement.\nTo the extent that outstanding options are exercised or restricted stock units vest and are settled, the investors\npurchasing our Common Stock in this Rights Offering will experience further dilution. In addition, we may choose to\nraise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations. To the extent that additional capital is\nraised through the sale of securities, the issuance of those securities could result in further dilution to our\nstockholders.\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMARKET PRICE OF AND DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK\nMarket Information\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market tier of Nasdaq under the ticker symbol \"GORV.”\nHolders of Record\nAs of [•], 2024, we had [•] holders of record of our Common Stock. The actual number of beneficial owners is\ngreater than this number of record holders and includes beneficial owners whose shares are held in street name by\nbrokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include beneficial owners whose\nCommon Stock may be held in trust or by other entities.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends on our\nCommon Stock in the foreseeable future. Our Board will determine our future dividend policy on the basis of many\nfactors, including results of operations, capital requirements, and general business conditions, subject to any\nrestrictions under our credit facility.\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE RIGHTS OFFERING\nThe Rights\nWe will distribute to Holders of record of our Common Stock and Holders of our Warrants (in the case of the\nWarrants, as though such Warrants are exercised in full and on an as-converted basis), as of 5:00 p.m., New York City\ntime, on [•], 2024 (other than the PIPE Investors (as defined below) and affiliates thereof who have waived their\nrespective rights to receive such distribution), at no charge, one non-transferable Right to purchase [3.05] shares of\nCommon Stock (as well as the right to purchase any additional shares pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right) at a\nsubscription price of $1.03 per whole share. You will receive one Right for every share of Common Stock held by you\nor issuable upon exercise or conversion of Warrants held by you as of the Record Date.\nThe Rights will be evidenced by Rights Certificates. Each Right will allow you to purchase [3.05] shares of our\nCommon Stock (as well as the right to purchase any additional shares pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right) at a\nsubscription price of $1.03 per whole share. If you elect to exercise your Basic Subscription Right in full, you may\nalso subscribe, at the subscription price, for additional shares of our Common Stock under your Over-Subscription\nRight, if there are enough shares available, and subject to certain limitations set forth in this prospectus. The Rights\nwill not be listed for trading on any securities exchange or trading system. The shares of Common Stock issued upon\nthe exercise of the Rights will be transferable following their issuance.\nReasons for the Rights Offering\nThe market for recreational vehicles (\"RVs”) is cyclical and is influenced by general economic conditions as well\nas more particularly by consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, fuel prices, interest rates\nand credit availability. Between the peaks and valleys of the market cycles, annual unit shipments fluctuate\nsignificantly, with unit shipments for the RV industry over a market cycle often doubling or tripling from valley to\npeak. Over approximately the last four decades, full market cycles have had duration of approximately 15 years.\nCompanies in the industry are challenged over the market cycle to manage inventories and costs to address\noften unpredictable changes in demand. Gradual adjustments in market conditions can be more effectively managed\nwhen compared to abrupt and dramatic changes since RV retailing cost models are heavily influenced by inventory\ncarrying costs and SG&A, which are difficult to adjust in short timeframes.\nStarting in the third quarter of 2022, as interest rates rose and consumer confidence softened, the RV retail\nindustry began experiencing a pronounced drop in demand, resulting in:\n• More intense competitive pressures as RV retailers pursue fewer RV buyers resulting in lower gross profits;\n• Excessive levels of inventory and model year changes creating unit obsolescence and associated\ndiscounting;\n• Longer inventory holding periods and curtailment payment obligations;\n• Lower trade-in ratios as recently purchased units lose relative market value; and\n• Reductions in non-trade in used unit purchases and resales as customers retain their existing units.\nFurther, market participants experienced inflationary pressures on product and overhead costs.\nIn addition to facing these industry-wide challenges, we faced additional challenges to our cash position based\non our capital investment strategy, including:\n• Basing part of our geographic expansion strategy on \"greenfield” new dealership builds, which consume\ncapital both for construction and to fund operating losses while the sites reach full production over a 2–3-\nyear period;\n• Investing significant capital in our existing facilities to make them fit for purpose and scale and to ensure\nthey provide our customers a peerless experience; and\n• Implementing a strategy focused on investing capital in owning rather than leasing our dealership\nlocations.\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBeyond stressors related to our capital investment strategy, we also experienced higher than expected operating\nlosses because some of our dealership locations underperformed financial and market share expectations.\nOn August 7, 2023, our Board of Directors (the \"Board”) formed a Financing Committee of the Board (the\n\"Financing Committee”), composed solely of independent directors, and appointed Robert DeVincenzi, James J.\nFredlake and Jordan Gnat to serve as the members of the Financing Committee. The Financing Committee was\noriginally formed by the Board to explore and review potential financing transactions for the purpose of funding\ngrowth.\nThe Company has a syndicated, senior secured floorplan credit facility and revolving credit facility, evidenced\nby the M&T Credit Agreement with M&T, which is secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our personal\nproperty. The Company is subject to numerous operating covenants under the terms of the M&T Credit Agreement.\nIn light of the dynamics facing the Company and the need for additional liquidity to support Company\noperations in the final quarter of 2023, the Board reformed the Financing Committee on December 22, 2023 and\nappointed Robert DeVincenzi, James J. Fredlake, and Susan Scarola, all independent directors, as members. The\nBoard empowered the Financing Committee to oversee the analysis, negotiation and execution of a financing subject\nto certain parameters established by the Board. Between December 22, 2023 and December 29, 2023, the Financing\nCommittee met periodically with members of Company management and advisors to consider various financing\nalternatives and terms. At the direction of the Financing Committee, the Company negotiated a $35 million real estate-\nbacked term loan, evidenced by the CCM Loan Agreement with the CCM Mortgage Lender, a client of CCM, as\nlender, which was, prior to the effectiveness of the CCM Loan Agreement First Amendment (as defined below),\nsecured by all of our owned real estate except our owned real estate that is mortgaged pursuant to the First Horizon\nMortgages and except for our owned real property located in Fort Pierce, Florida. Following negotiations, the CCM\nLoan Agreement and related transactions were unanimously authorized by the Financing Committee. The parties then\nentered into the CCM Loan Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were consummated on\nDecember 29, 2023.\nOur debt facilities have since consisted of:\n• the M&T Credit Agreement;\n• the CCM Loan Agreement; and\n• the First Horizon Mortgages.\nDue to the factors described above and the decline in our operational performance to levels below prior\nexpectations, this year it became necessary for us to pursue a series of amendments to, and to obtain waivers of\ndefaults (or future events that were anticipated to be defaults) under, the M&T Credit Agreement and the CCM Loan\nAgreement. In addition, we determined that we needed to raise additional capital to support our balance sheet and\nprovide additional working capital for our operations. Consistent with its mandate, the Financing Committee explored\nvarious financing alternatives throughout the first half of 2024.\nBy the beginning of March 2024, the Company faced potential non-compliance with its covenants under the\nM&T Credit Agreement. With authorization from the Board upon the recommendation of the Financing Committee,\non March 8, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and\nConsent (the \"First M&T Credit Agreement Amendment”) with M&T and the lenders party to the M&T Credit\nAgreement (the \"M&T Lenders”) to obtain waivers of and modifications to certain covenants under the M&T Credit\nAgreement. Among other changes, the First M&T Credit Agreement Amendment eliminated testing of the total net\nleverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants until the fiscal quarter ending September 30,\n2024 and reduced the required minimum current ratio financial covenant until the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024.\nAdditionally, the first amendment created new financial covenants for minimum consolidated EBITDA and minimum\nliquidity. The first amendment also restricted our ability to make certain investments, dispositions and restricted\npayments, and it added a new pricing tier to the leveraged-based pricing grid for the M&T Credit Agreement, with\npricing 35 basis points higher than the highest tier immediately prior to the first amendment.\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFollowing the signing of the First M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the Financing Committee continued to\nhold periodic meetings and pursue financing alternatives. However, the Company continued to face similar\nheadwinds, and as of March 31, 2024, we were not in compliance with all of our covenants under the M&T Credit\nAgreement, as amended and waived earlier that month, as we did not meet our minimum trailing twelve-month\nminimum EBITDA requirement.\nTo address the Company’s continued non-compliance with its covenants under the M&T Credit Agreement, on\nMay 14, 2024 the Company negotiated and entered into, at the direction of the Financing Committee, the Second\nAmendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Consent (the \"Second M&T Credit Agreement\nAmendment”) with M&T and the M&T Lenders. The Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment reduced the M&T\nLenders’ aggregate floor plan commitment under the M&T Credit Agreement from $525 million to $480 million and\nfurther amended the definition of the applicable margin to provide that, until the company achieved a total net\nleverage ratio for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2025 that was less than 3.00 to 1.00 (such period, the \"Ratio\nAdjustment Period”), pricing would further increase by 15 basis points higher than the highest tier that was in effect\nunder the First M&T Credit Agreement Amendment. The Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment also provided\nthat, during the Ratio Adjustment Period, the company would no longer be permitted to borrow revolving loans\nunder the M&T Credit Agreement. Under the Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, testing of the total net\nleverage and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants were eliminated until the fiscal quarter ending March 31,\n2025, and the minimum amounts for the current ratio financial covenant were reduced until the fiscal quarter ending\nMarch 31, 2025. The Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment also made certain adjustments to the minimum\nconsolidated EBITDA and minimum liquidity financial covenants. We agreed in the Second M&T Credit Agreement\nAmendment to further restrictions on investments and dispositions, and we agreed to certain additional restrictions\non transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, as a condition to entering into the Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, M&T required that\nthe Company pay down $10.0 million on the revolving credit facility by December 31, 2024, and the Company\nconcluded it would need to raise additional financing to make those payments. The Company, by and under the\ndirection of the Financing Committee, sought out potential financing alternatives to aid the Company in making the\npayments required by M&T, and the Financing Committee held periodic meetings with members of Company\nmanagement and advisors. After the Company failed to secure any actionable financing alternatives by mid-May\n2024, we proposed amending the CCM Loan Agreement to provide an additional $15.0 million in debt financing under\nthe CCM Loan Agreement. Following negotiations with CCM undertaken at the direction of the Financing Committee,\nthe Financing Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors unanimously approved, such amendment to the\nCCM Loan Agreement upon such recommendation of the Financing Committee. Christopher S. Shackelton, a director\ndesignated by the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the\ntime who is also the co-founder and managing partner of CCM, did not participate in the approval process for\namending the CCM Loan Agreement.\nOn May 15, 2024 we entered into a First Amendment to Loan Agreement (the \"CCM Loan Agreement First\nAmendment”), with the CCM Mortgage Lender, which provided for an additional $15.0 million mortgage loan secured\nby our owned real property that is located in Fort Pierce, Florida in addition to the other remaining real estate\nproperties backing the CCM Loan Agreement. In connection with the CCM Loan Agreement First Amendment, and\nas a condition to the CCM Mortgage Lender providing the additional financing thereunder, we also issued to\nColiseum Capital Partners, L.P. (\"CCP”) and Blackwell Partners LLC – Series A (\"Blackwell”), each an advisory client\nof CCM and owner of CCM Mortgage Lender, warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of\n$5.25 per share, subject to certain adjustments (the \"CCM Warrants”). Those warrants may be exercised at any time\non or after May 15, 2024 and until May 15, 2034.\nIn June 2024, we entered into a new engagement agreement with our investment banker, Stifel, Nicolaus &\nCompany, Incorporated, including its business division, Miller Buckfire & Co. (collectively, \"Miller Buckfire”), to\nadvise the Company in connection with a review of strategic alternatives, including to raise additional sources of\ncapital. In advance of launching a formal financing process on August 1, 2024, Miller Buckfire prepared a financing\noffering memorandum and populated a detailed virtual data room for use in soliciting interest from investors. Through\nNovember 2024, Miller Buckfire has run a targeted, yet comprehensive, financing process, contacting 39 parties,\ncomprised of 4 strategic investors and 35 financial parties. These parties include investors identified by Miller\nBuckfire, investors identified by the Company and CCM as well as investors that expressed\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninterest following the Company’s August 2024 announcement that it engaged Miller Buckfire to raise incremental\ncapital. 15 of these parties executed confidentiality agreements, received the financing offering memorandum and\naccess to the Company’s virtual data room and were offered meetings with management. Throughout the process,\nMiller Buckfire expressed to prospective investors that the Company was willing and open to evaluate all financing\nstructures, provided such financing structure would alleviate the Company’s liquidity needs and be acceptable to\nexisting parties. None of the parties other than those involved in the transactions described herein expressed any\nwritten indication of interest or letter of intent regarding a potential transaction.\nThroughout the months that followed the Company’s entry into the Second M&T Credit Agreement\nAmendment and the CCM Loan Agreement First Amendment, and the Company’s receipt of the additional financing\npursuant to the CCM Loan Agreement First Amendment, the Company continued to face headwinds and challenges\nwith the satisfaction of its debt covenants under the M&T Credit Agreement along with substantial liquidity\nchallenges. During this period, the Financing Committee and Company representatives continued to seek out various\nfinancing alternatives, and the Financing Committee continued to hold periodic meetings with members of Company\nmanagement and advisors.\nIn the months that followed our entry into the Second M&T Credit Agreement Amendment and the CCM Loan\nAgreement First Amendment, we entered into a series of limited waiver agreements in July, August, and September\n2024 (collectively, the \"M&T Limited Waiver Agreements”) with M&T and the M&T Lenders. The M&T Limited\nWaiver Agreements provided a temporary waiver of defaults resulting from, among other things:\n• our inability to comply with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant with respect to June, July, August,\nSeptember and October 2024;\n• our inability to comply with the minimum liquidity financial covenant for July, August, September and\nOctober 2024;\n• our inability to comply with the minimum current ratio financial covenant for our fiscal quarters ended\nJune 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024; and\n• the filing of certain mechanic’s, materialman’s, construction or similar liens against certain of our real\nproperty, relating to our failure to pay for certain improvements made thereto.\nUnder the M&T Limited Waiver Agreements, we decreased the M&T Lenders’ aggregate floor plan commitment\nunder the M&T Credit Agreement from $480 million to $400 million and agreed to a temporary limit on the outstanding\nfloor plan loans of $380 million. We also agreed, among other terms, to repay the revolving credit facility by an\nadditional $1.0 million; to provide M&T and the M&T Lenders with an increased level of financial reporting; to\nengage CR3 Partners as our financial advisor; to cause an employee of CR3 Partners to be appointed as our interim\nChief Financial Officer until a permanent Chief Financial Officer reasonably acceptable to M&T is selected and\napproved by our board of directors; to attempt to raise new capital and to engage an investment banker to assist us\nin connection with doing so; to a new average daily liquidity financial covenant, which was tested weekly; to\nrestrictions on transactions, including investments and dispositions, outside of the ordinary course of business; and\nto refrain from declaring dividends or making other restricted payments.\nIn September 2024, our former Chief Executive Officer, John North, and our former Chief Financial Officer, Kelly\nPorter, resigned. Our Board then appointed Ronald K. Fleming, a former Senior Vice President of Operations of the\nCompany, as our Interim Chief Executive Officer; promoted Amber Dillard as our Chief Operating Officer; and\nappointed Jeff Huddleston, a partner at CR3 Partners, as our Interim Chief Financial Officer.\nOn September 27, 2024, and with the approval and at the direction of the Financing Committee, we entered into a\nLimited Waiver of Defaults with the CCM Mortgage Lender (the \"CCM Loan Agreement Waiver”), pursuant to which\nthe CCM Mortgage Lender waived certain defaults relating to the filing of certain mechanic’s, materialman’s,\nconstruction or similar-type liens filed or to be filed against the real property mortgaged to the CCM Mortgage\nLender, provided that such liens are discharged of record (by payment, bonding or otherwise) by certain deadlines.\nWith assistance of Miller Buckfire, acting at the direction of the Financing Committee, the Company pursued\nalternative sources of financings and concluded that the following capital-raising transactions are most\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nlikely to achieve the Company’s objectives on the terms and on a timeline that is in the best interests the Company\nand of our stockholders. The below transactions were then negotiated at the direction of the Financing Committee\nand were considered by the Financing Committee over the course of various meetings held in the weeks preceding its\nrecommendation of such transactions, following which the Financing Committee recommended, and the Board\nunanimously approved, the following transactions:\n• Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment. On November 15, 2024, the Company entered into the Third\nM&T Credit Agreement Amendment, with M&T and the M&T Lenders.\n○ The Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment grants the Company waivers of specified defaults and\nevents of default that occurred under the M&T Credit Agreement, including events of default\nresulting from: (a) its inability to comply with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant with respect to\nJune, July, August, September and October 2024; (b) its inability to comply with the minimum liquidity\nfinancial covenant for July, August, September and October 2024; (c) its inability to comply with the\nminimum current ratio financial covenant for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30,\n2024; (d) the filing of certain mechanic’s, materialmen’s, construction or similar liens against certain of\nthe Company’s real property, relating to its failure to pay for certain improvements made thereto; and\n(e) certain cross-defaults under the CCM Loan Agreement and the First Horizon Mortgages relating to\nthe foregoing.\n○ Under the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment, the lenders’ aggregate commitment under the\nfloorplan facility decreased from $400 million to (a) $325 million, from the date of the Third M&T Credit\nAgreement Amendment through the date (the \"Asset Sale Outside Date”) that is 60 days after the final\nclosing of the Camping World Asset Sales, and (b) $295 million, thereafter through the maturity date,\nprovided that until the Asset Sale Outside Date, the Company may borrow up to an additional\n$10 million in floor plan loans (the \"Floor Plan Overlimit Loans”), subject to the satisfaction of certain\nconditions.

We may extend the time for exercising the\nRights or terminate the Rights, subject to the terms and conditions of the PIPE Purchase Agreements and the Third\nM&T Credit Agreement Amendment.

See \"— Procedures for DTC Participants.”\nNote that we intend to complete the Rights Offering on or before [•], 2024 unless our Financing Committee elects\nto extend the Rights Offering in its discretion. We may extend the expiration date of the Rights Offering by giving\nnotice to the Subscription Agent and Information Agent on or before the scheduled expiration date. If we elect to\nextend the expiration of the Rights Offering, we will issue a press release announcing such extension no later than\n9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the most recently announced expiration date.\nWe reserve the right, subject to the terms and conditions of the PIPE Purchase Agreements and the Third M&T\nCredit Agreement Amendment, to amend or modify the terms or conditions of the Rights or the Rights Offering or to\nterminate the Rights or Rights Offering.\nIf you do not exercise your Rights before the expiration date of the Rights Offering, your unexercised Rights will\nbe null and void and will have no value. We will not be obligated to honor your exercise of Rights if the Subscription\nAgent receives the documents relating to your exercise after the Rights Offering expires, regardless of when you\ntransmitted the documents, except when you have timely transmitted the documents under the guaranteed delivery\nprocedures described below.\nSubscription Rights\nYour Rights entitle you to the Basic Subscription Right and the Over-Subscription Right.\nBasic Subscription Right. With your Basic Subscription Right, you may purchase [3.05] shares of our Common\nStock per Right, upon delivery of the required documents and payment of the subscription price of $1.03 per whole\nshare. You are not required to exercise all of your Rights unless you wish to purchase shares under your Over-\nSubscription Right. We will deliver to you the shares which you purchased with your Basic Subscription Right as\nsoon as practicable after the Rights Offering has expired and the shares are issued. All\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares that are purchased in the Rights Offering will be issued in uncertificated book-entry form, meaning that you\nwill receive a direct registration account statement from our transfer agent reflecting ownership of these securities if\nyou are a holder of record. If you hold your shares in the name of a bank, broker, dealer or other nominee, DTC will\ncredit your nominee with the securities you purchased in the Rights Offering.\nOver-Subscription Right. In addition to your Basic Subscription Right, you may subscribe for additional shares\nof our Common Stock, upon delivery of the required documents and payment of the subscription price of $1.03 per\nshare, before the expiration of the Rights Offering. You may only exercise your Over-Subscription Right if you\nexercised your Basic Subscription Right in full and other holders of Rights do not exercise their Basic Subscription\nRights in full.\nPro Rata Allocation. If there are not enough shares to satisfy all subscriptions made under the Over-\nSubscription Right, we will allocate the remaining shares pro rata, after rounding down any fractional shares that\nwould otherwise be issued to the nearest whole number of shares, among those oversubscribing Holders. If there is a\npro rata allocation of the remaining shares and you receive an allocation of a greater number of shares than you\nsubscribed for under your Over-Subscription Right, then we will allocate to you only the number of shares for which\nyou subscribed. We will allocate the remaining shares among all other holders exercising their Over-Subscription\nRights.\nFull Exercise of Basic Subscription Right. You may exercise your Over-Subscription Right only if you exercise\nyour Basic Subscription Right in full. To determine if you have fully exercised your Basic Subscription Right, we will\nconsider only the Basic Subscription Rights held by you in the same capacity.\nFor example, suppose that you received Rights as a distribution on shares of our Common Stock which you hold\nindividually and on shares of our Common Stock which you hold collectively with your spouse. If you wish to\nexercise your Over-Subscription Right with respect to the Rights you hold individually, but not with respect to the\nRights you hold collectively with your spouse, you only need to fully exercise your Basic Subscription Right with\nrespect to your individually held Rights. You do not have to subscribe for any shares under the Basic Subscription\nRight held collectively with your spouse to exercise your individual Over-Subscription Right.\nWhen you complete the portion of your Rights Certificate to exercise your Over-Subscription Right, you will be\nrepresenting and certifying that you have fully exercised your subscription rights as to shares of our Common Stock\nwhich you hold in that capacity. You must exercise your Over-Subscription Right at the same time you exercise your\nBasic Subscription Right in full.\nReturn of Excess Payment. If you exercised your Over-Subscription Right and are allocated less than all of the\nshares for which you wished to subscribe, your excess payment for shares that were not allocated to you will be\nreturned, without interest or deduction, as soon as practicable after the expiration date. We will deliver or cause the\ntransfer agent to deliver shares that you purchased as soon as practicable after the expiration date and after all pro\nrata allocations and adjustments have been completed.\nNo Fractional Shares of Common Stock\nWe will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of any Rights. After aggregating all of\nthe shares subscribed for by a particular stockholder, including shares subscribed for pursuant to the Over-\nSubscription Right, any fractional shares of our Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon the exercise of\nthe Rights by that stockholder will be rounded down to the nearest whole share, with such adjustments as may be\nnecessary to ensure that we offer a maximum of 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. In the\nunlikely event that, because of the rounding of fractional shares, this Rights Offering would have been subscribed in\nan amount in excess of 24,271,844 shares of Common Stock, all Holders’ shares issued in this Rights Offering will be\nreduced in an equitable manner. Any excess subscription funds in respect of fractional shares will be returned to you,\nwithout interest or deduction, promptly after completion of the Rights Offering.\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nConditions to the Rights Offering\nOur obligation to consummate the Rights Offering is condition upon, among other things, Nasdaq approving for\nlisting, subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of our Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights.\nWe also reserve the right, by action of the Financing Committee, to amend the terms and conditions of the Rights or\nthe Rights Offering or to otherwise modify the terms or conditions of the Rights or the Rights Offering, in each case\nsubject to the terms and conditions of the PIPE Purchase Agreements and the Third M&T Credit Agreement\nAmendment.\nWe intend to complete the Rights Offering on or before [•], 2024, unless our Financing Committee elects to\nextend the Rights Offering or terminate the Rights or the Rights Offering, subject to the terms and conditions of the\nPIPE Purchase Agreements and the Third M&T Credit Agreement Amendment.

Box 1317\nAttn: BCIS Re-Organization Dept.\nBrentwood, NY 11717-0718\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\nAlthough the authorities governing transactions such as the Rights Offering are complex and unclear in certain\nrespects (including with respect to the effects of the Over-Subscription Right and the participation in this Rights\nOffering by holders of the Warrants), we believe and intend to take the position that a U.S. Holder’s receipt of Rights\npursuant to the Rights Offering may be treated as a taxable distribution with respect to such holder’s existing shares\nof Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock received pursuant to the exchange or conversion of all\nSeries A Preferred Stock prior to the Record Date) and should not be treated as a taxable distribution with respect to\nsuch holder’s Series A Preferred Stock and Warrants for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This position regarding\nthe non-taxable treatment of the Rights Offering is not binding on the IRS or the courts. The fair market value of the\nRights would be taxable to U.S. Holders of our Common Stock as a dividend to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata\nshare of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, if any, with any excess being treated as a return of capital\nto the extent thereof and then as capital gain. The Company believes that it may have current and accumulated\nearnings and profits through the end of 2024.\nFurther, if the Rights Offering is treated as a taxable distribution, the treatment of holders of Warrants is not\nclear, and it may differ from, and may be more adverse than, the treatment of the Rights distribution to the holders of\nCommon Stock. For a more detailed discussion, including U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to Non-\nU.S. Holders, see \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.” You should consult your tax advisor as to the\nparticular considerations applicable to you of the Rights Offering.\nRegulatory Limitation\nWe will not be required to issue the shares of our Common Stock to you pursuant to the Rights Offering if, in\nour opinion, it would be unlawful to do so or you would be required to obtain prior clearance or approval from any\nforeign, state or federal regulatory authorities to own or control such shares if, at the time the Rights Offering expires,\nyou have not obtained such clearance or approval.\nQuestions About Exercising Rights\nIf you have any questions or require assistance regarding the method of exercising your Rights or requests for\nadditional copies of this document or the \"Instructions as to Use of Lazydays Holdings, Inc.’s Rights Certificates,”\nyou should contact the Information Agent at the address and telephone number set forth under \"Questions &\nAnswers — What should I do if I have other questions?” included elsewhere in this prospectus.\nSubscription Agent and Information Agent\nWe have appointed Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC to act as Subscription Agent and Information\nAgent for the Rights Offering. You should direct any questions or requests for assistance concerning the method of\nsubscribing for the shares of our Common Stock or for additional copies of this prospectus to the Information Agent.\nFees and Expenses\nWe will pay all fees charged by the Subscription Agent and Information Agent and all other expenses incurred\nby us in the Rights Offering. You are responsible for paying any commissions, fees, taxes or other expenses incurred\nin connection with your exercise of your Rights.\nNo Revocation\nOnce you have exercised your Rights, you may not revoke your exercise. All exercises of Rights are irrevocable.\nYou should not exercise your Rights unless you are certain that you wish to purchase Common Stock in the Rights\nOffering. See \"Summary — Recent Developments” and \"Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Rights Offering —\nThere may be material developments regarding us during the subscription period. In considering whether to exercise\nyour Rights, you should consider that all exercises of Rights are irrevocable, even if you subsequently learn\ninformation about us that you consider to be unfavorable.” Rights not exercised before the expiration date of the\nRights Offering will expire and will have no value.\nProcedures for DTC Participants\nIf you are a broker, a dealer, a trustee or a depositary for securities who holds our Common Stock for the account\nof others as a nominee holder, you may exercise your beneficial owners’ basic and Over-Subscription Rights through\nDTC.

We do not anticipate that there will be any changes in the Rights Offering, and we may, in our sole\ndiscretion, decline to make modifications to the terms of the Rights Offering requested by regulators in states or other\njurisdictions, in which case stockholders who live in those states or other jurisdictions will not be eligible to\nparticipate in the Rights Offering.\nShares of Common Stock Outstanding after the Rights Offering\nAs of November 15, 2024, we had 59,939,113 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and Warrants to\npurchase 10,494,531 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.\nIn this Rights Offering, we are offering Holders the Right to purchase [3.05] shares of Common Stock for each\nRight (as well as the right to purchase any additional shares pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right (as defined\nbelow), subject to adjustment as provided herein. As a result, following the Rights Offering and assuming it is\nconsummated in full, taking into account the issuance of 49,866,710 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the\nExchange Agreements, we will have 134,378,024 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDESCRIPTION OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK\nThe following is a description of the material terms of our Common Stock and preferred stock as set forth in our\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the \"Certificate of Incorporation”), and our\nAmended and Restated Bylaws (the \"Bylaws”), or as otherwise provided under the General Corporation Law of the\nState of Delaware (the \"DGCL”), which collectively govern the rights, powers and preference of our Common Stock\nand preferred stock. This description is only a summary. You should read it together with the Certificate of\nIncorporation (including the Certificate of Designation) and Bylaws, which are included as exhibits to the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and incorporated by reference herein, as well as\nthe DGCL.\nGeneral\nOn November 15, 2024, stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the stockholders of the Company\napproved and adopted an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase our authorized Common Stock.\nThe amendment become effective on [•], 2024. Following such amendment, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes\nthe issuance of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred\nstock, par value $0.0001 per share. As of November 15, 2024, we had 59,939,113 shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nThe holders of our Common Stock, as such, are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters\nto be voted on by stockholders. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the\nresult that the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of\nthe directors standing for election at each annual meeting of stockholders.\nHolders of our Common Stock do not have any conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights (excluding,\nfor the avoidance of doubt, the Rights issued as a distribution to the Holders) and there are no sinking fund or\nredemption provisions applicable to our Common Stock.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends on our\nCommon Stock in the foreseeable future. Our Board will determine our future dividend policy on the basis of many\nfactors, including results of operations, capital requirements, and general business conditions, subject to any\nrestrictions under our credit facility.\nOur Board currently consists of seven (7) directors who are divided into three classes. Directors in each class\nserve a three-year term. The terms of each class expire at successive annual meetings so that the stockholders elect\none class of directors at each annual meeting. The current classification of our Board is: (i) Class A – has two (2)\ndirectors with a term expiring at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders; (ii) Class B – has three (3) directors with a\nterm expiring at the 2026 annual meeting of stockholders; and (iii) Class C – has two (2) directors with a term expiring\nat the 2027 annual meeting of stockholders.\nPreferred Stock\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock with\nsuch designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board. Any designated\nseries of preferred stock shall have such powers, designations, preferences and relative, participation or optional or\nother special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be expressed in the resolution\nadopted by the Board. Prior to the issuance of shares of each newly designated series of preferred stock, the Board is\nrequired by the DGCL and our Certificate of Incorporation to adopt resolutions and file a certificate of designations\nwith the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The certificate of designations fixes for each class or series the\ndesignations, powers, preferences, rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, including, but not\nlimited to, some or all of the following: (i) voting powers, if any, whether full or limited; (ii) whether such shares are\nsubject to redemption at such time or times and at such price or prices as our Board may establish; (iii) rights to\nreceive dividends (which may be cumulative or non-cumulative) at such rates, on such conditions, and at such times,\nand payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or classes or any other\nseries as our Board may establish; (iv) liquidation rights or preferences upon the dissolution of us, or upon any\ndistribution of our assets, as our Board may establish; or (v) rights providing that such shares shall be convertible\ninto,\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock, or of any other series of the same or any other\nclass or classes of stock, of ours at such price or prices or at such rates of exchange and with such adjustments as\nour Board may establish.\nProvisions of Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL”), the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws\nand other relevant documents described below could make it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a\nproxy contest or otherwise, or to remove incumbent officers and directors. These provisions, summarized below, are\nexpected to discourage types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons\nseeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our\npotential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us\noutweigh the disadvantages of discouraging takeover or acquisition proposals because, among other things,\nnegotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Statute. We have not opted out of, and therefore are subject to Section 203 of the\nDGCL, an anti-takeover statute. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging\nin a \"business combination” with an \"interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the time the\nperson became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the\ntransaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a\n\"business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to\nthe interested stockholder. Generally, an \"interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and\nassociates, owns (or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within three years prior to the determination of\ninterested stockholder status did own) 15 percent or more of a corporation’s voting stock. The existence of this\nprovision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by\nthe Board, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of\nCommon Stock.\nLimitation of Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors. The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit\nor eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for\nbreaches of directors’ fiduciary duties as directors. The Certificate of Incorporation includes provisions exculpating\nour directors from such liability to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. The Certificate of Incorporation and\nBylaws include provisions that indemnify, to the fullest extent allowable under the DGCL, our directors or officers for\nactions taken as a director or officer of the Company, or for serving at our request as a director or officer or in another\nposition at another corporation or enterprise, as the case may be. The Bylaws also provide that we must indemnify\nand advance expenses to our directors and officers, subject to, in the case of advancement, our receipt of an\nundertaking from the indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be\nindemnified by the Company and such terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate by the Board. We are also\nexpressly authorized to carry directors’ and officers’ insurance to protect the Company and our directors, officers,\nemployees and agents from certain liabilities.\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws may\ndiscourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit directly or derivatively against directors or officers for breach of\ntheir fiduciary duties. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative or direct\nlitigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us or our\nstockholders. We may be adversely affected to the extent that, in a class action or direct suit, we pay the costs of\nsettlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions or other\namounts we are obligated to advance or indemnify in these or any other actions, suits, proceedings or investigations.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares of Common Stock. Our authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock will\nbe available for future issuance without approval by the holders of Common Stock, except as may be required under\nthe listing rules of any stock exchange on which our Common Stock is then listed. We may use additional shares for a\nvariety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, employee benefit plans and\nas consideration for or to finance future acquisitions, investments or other purposes. The existence of authorized but\nunissued shares of Common Stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by\nmeans of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUndesignated Preferred Stock. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws authorize 5,000,000 shares of\nundesignated preferred stock. As a result, our Board may, without the approval of holders of Common Stock, issue\nshares of preferred stock with super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights, powers or preferences that\ncould impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring,\ndelaying or discouraging hostile takeovers or changes in control or management of the Company.\nClassified Board. As discussed above, our Board currently consists of eight (8) directors who are divided into\nthree classes. Pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, directors in each class serve a three-year term. The terms\nof each class expire at successive annual meetings so that the stockholders elect one class of directors at each\nannual meeting. The classified board provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation could make it more difficult to\nacquire us by means of a proxy contest or to remove incumbent directors (who may only be removed for cause).\nExclusive Forum. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and\nexclusive forum for any stockholder or any beneficial owner to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought\non behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer\nor other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim\narising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (iv) any action\nasserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or\nif the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court located within the State of Delaware, or if no\nstate court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware)\nin all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants.\nSection 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction over suits\nbrought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and as\nsuch the exclusive jurisdiction clauses set forth above would not apply to such suits. Furthermore, Section 22 of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act”), provides for concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state\ncourts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations\nthereunder, and as such the exclusive jurisdiction clauses set forth above would not apply to such suits.\nListing\nOur shares of Common Stock are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"GORV.” We cannot\nassure you that our Common Stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market as we might not meet\ncertain continued listing standards in the future.\nTransfer Agent\nThe transfer agent for our shares of Common Stock is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 1 State\nStreet, 30th Floor, New York, New York 10004.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES\nThe following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the receipt and\nexercise or expiration of the Rights acquired through the Rights Offering and the ownership and disposition of shares\nof our Common Stock received upon exercise of the Rights and constitutes the opinion of Stoel Rives LLP. This\ndiscussion does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The effects of other U.S. federal tax\nlaws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This\ndiscussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code”), Treasury Regulations\npromulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the IRS, and\nsuch other authorities as we have considered relevant, in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities\nmay change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied\nretroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Rights or shares of our Common Stock. We have\nnot sought and do not intend to seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be\nno assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax\nconsequences of the receipt of Rights through the Rights Offering by persons holding shares of our Common Stock\nor Warrants entitled to receive Rights pursuant to this Rights Offering, the exercise or expiration of the Rights, and\nthe acquisition, ownership and disposition of shares of our Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Rights.\nThis discussion is limited to the Rights acquired through the Rights Offering and shares of our Common Stock\nacquired upon exercise of Rights, in each case, that are held as a \"capital asset” within the meaning of Section 1221 of\nthe Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax, the\nunearned income Medicare contribution tax, the estate or gift tax consequences, or the indirect effects on holders of\ninterests in a beneficial owner of the Rights. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders\nsubject to particular rules, including, without limitation:\n• U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;\n• persons holding the Rights, shares of our Common Stock or Warrants as part of a hedge, straddle or other\nrisk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;\n• banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;\n• brokers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies or traders that elect to mark-to-market their securities;\n• \"controlled foreign corporations,” \"passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that\naccumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;\n• partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);\n• real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, grantor trusts, tax-exempt organizations or\ngovernmental organizations;\n• persons deemed to sell the Rights, shares of our Common Stock or Warrants under the constructive sale\nprovisions of the Code;\n• persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income being taken into\naccount in an applicable financial statement (as defined in the Code);\n• persons for whom our stock constitutes \"qualified small business stock” within the meaning of\nSection 1202 of the Code;\n• persons who received, hold or will receive shares of our Common Stock, Warrants or the Rights pursuant to\nthe exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation and persons who hold restricted\nCommon Stock;\n• tax-qualified retirement plans; and\n• U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nIf an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of our Common Stock,\nStock, Warrants, or Rights or shares of our Common Stock acquired upon exercise of Rights, the tax treatment of a\npartner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships and the partners in such partnerships\nshould consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.\nINVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE RECEIPT, OWNERSHIP AND EXERCISE OR EXPIRATION OF RIGHTS AND THE\nACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ACQUIRED UPON\nEXERCISE OF RIGHTS ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE\nLAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE\nINCOME TAX TREATY.\nTax Considerations Applicable to U.S. Holders\nDefinition of a U.S. Holder\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \"U.S. Holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of our Common Stock, our\nWarrants, our Rights or shares of our Common Stock acquired upon exercise of Rights, as the case may be, that, for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:\n• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n• a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or\norganized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;\n• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or\n• a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more United\nStates persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid election in effect\nto be treated as a United States person (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes.\nReceipt of Rights\nThe authorities governing transactions such as the Rights Offering are complex and unclear in certain respects\n(including with respect to the effects of the Over-Subscription Right and the distribution of Rights to holders of\nWarrants). A U.S. Holder’s receipt of Rights pursuant to the Rights Offering may be treated as a taxable distribution\nwith respect to such holder’s existing shares of Common Stock and should not be treated as a taxable distribution\nwith respect to such holder’s Warrants for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Section 305(a) of the Code generally\nprovides that the receipt by a shareholder of a right to acquire stock or warrants is not included in the taxable income\nof the shareholder; however, the general non-recognition rule in Section 305(a) of the Code is subject to exceptions\ndescribed in Section 305(b) of the Code, which include \"disproportionate distributions.” A disproportionate\ndistribution is generally a distribution or a series of distributions, including deemed distributions, that has the effect\nof the receipt of cash or other property by some shareholders (including holders of rights to acquire stock and\nholders of debt instruments convertible into stock) and an increase in the proportionate interest of other\nshareholders (including holders of rights to acquire stock and holders of debt instruments convertible into stock) in a\ncorporation’s assets or earnings and profits.\nDuring the last 36 months, the Company has made quarterly dividend payments to holders of Series A Preferred\nStock, and holders of Common Stock may be treated as having received an increase in their proportionate interest in\nthe Company’s assets or earnings and profits through a decrease in the conversion ratio with respect to both the\nSeries A Preferred Stock and Warrants.\nIf this Rights Offering is a taxable distribution with respect to any shareholder, the fair market value of such U.S.\nHolder’s increase in the share of earnings and profits of the Company would be taxable to such U.S. Holder as a\ndividend to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits, if any, with any excess being treated as a return of capital to the extent thereof and then as capital gain. The\nCompany believes that it may have current and accumulated earnings and profits through the end of 2024. Further, if\nthe Rights issuance is treated as a taxable distribution, the treatment of holders of Warrants is not clear, and it may\ndiffer from, and may be more adverse than, the treatment of the Rights distribution to the U.S. Holders of Common\nStock.\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTax Basis in the Rights\nIf the Rights issuance pursuant to this Rights Offering is treated as a non-taxable distribution and if the fair\nmarket value of the Rights a U.S. Holder receives is less than 15% of the fair market value of the U.S. Holder’s existing\nshares of Common Stock or Warrants, in each case, with respect to which the Rights are distributed on the date the\nU.S. Holder receives the Rights, Section 307(b) of the Code provides that the Rights will be allocated a zero tax basis\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless the U.S. Holder elects to allocate the tax basis in the holder’s existing\nshares of Common Stock or Warrants between the existing shares of Common Stock and the Rights in proportion to\nthe relative fair market values of the existing shares of Common Stock or Warrants and the Rights determined on the\ndate of receipt of the Rights. If a U.S. Holder chooses to allocate tax basis between the holder’s existing shares of\nCommon Stock or Warrants and the Rights, the U.S. Holder must make this election on a statement included with the\nholder’s timely filed U.S. federal income tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder\nreceives the Rights. Such an election is irrevocable.\nHowever, if the fair market value of the Rights a U.S. Holder receives is 15% or more of the fair market value of\nthe holder’s existing shares of Common Stock or Warrants on the date the U.S. Holder receives the Rights, then the\nU.S. Holder must allocate tax basis in the existing shares of Common Stock or Warrants between those shares and the\nRights the U.S. Holder receives in proportion to their fair market values determined on the date the U.S. Holder\nreceives the Rights. Please refer to the discussion below regarding the U.S. tax treatment of a U.S. Holder that, at the\ntime of the receipt of the Right, no longer holds the Common Stock or Warrants with respect to which the Right was\ndistributed.\nIf the Rights issued pursuant to this Rights Offering are treated as a taxable distribution, then the U.S. Holder\nwill receive the Rights with a basis equal to their fair market value on the date of the distribution for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nThe fair market value of the Rights on the date that the Rights are distributed is uncertain, and we have not\nobtained, and do not intend to obtain, an appraisal of the fair market value of the Rights on that date. In determining\nthe fair market value of the Rights, U.S. Holders should consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including,\nwithout limitation, any difference between the subscription price of the Rights and the trading price of our shares of\nCommon Stock on the date that the Rights are distributed, the exercise price of the Warrants, the fair market value\nand the length of the period during which the Rights may be exercised and the fact that the Rights are non-\ntransferable.\nExercise of Rights\nA U.S. Holder will not recognize gain or loss upon the exercise of a Right received in the Rights Offering. A U.S.\nHolder’s adjusted tax basis, if any, in the Right plus the subscription price will establish the U.S. Holder’s initial tax\nbasis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the shares of Common Stock received upon exercise of such U.S.\nHolder’s Right. The holding period of a share of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of a Right in the Rights\nOffering will begin on the date of exercise.\nIf, at the time of the receipt or exercise of the Right, the U.S. Holder no longer holds the Common Stock or\nWarrants with respect to which the Right was distributed, then certain aspects of the tax treatment of the receipt and\nexercise of the Right are unclear, including (1) the allocation of the tax basis between the shares of our Common Stock\nor Warrants previously sold and the Right, (2) the impact of such allocation on the amount and timing of gain or loss\nrecognized with respect to the shares of our Common Stock or Warrants previously sold, and (3) the impact of such\nallocation on the tax basis of the shares of our Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Right. Furthermore, if a\nU.S. Holder exercises any Rights and sells other shares of our Common Stock or Warrants within the 61-day period\nbeginning 30 days before the exercise date and ending 30 days after the exercise date, the \"wash sale” rules under the\nCode may disallow the recognition of any loss upon the sale of our Common Stock or Warrants. If a U.S. Holder\nexercises a Right received in the Rights Offering after disposing of shares of our Common Stock or Warrants with\nrespect to which the Right is received, the U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor.\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExpiration of Rights\nIf the receipt of Rights pursuant to this Rights Offering is not taxable and if a U.S. Holder allows Rights received\nin the Rights Offering to expire, the U.S. Holder should not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, and the U.S. Holder should re-allocate any portion of the tax basis in its existing Common Stock or\nWarrants previously allocated to the Rights that have expired to such U.S. Holder’s existing shares of Common Stock\nor Warrants.\nIf the receipt of Rights pursuant to this Rights Offering is taxable and a U.S. Holder allows the Rights received in\nthis Rights Offering to expire, then such U.S. Holder should recognize a short-term capital loss equal to such U.S.\nHolder’s tax basis in the expired Rights. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.\nDistributions on Common Stock\nAs described in the section titled \"Market Price of and Dividends on Common Stock—Dividends,” we do not\nanticipate declaring or paying cash dividends to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. However, if\nwe do make distributions of cash or property on our Common Stock, such distributions will constitute dividends to\nthe extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Dividends received by a corporate U.S. Holder may be eligible for a dividends received deduction, subject\nto applicable limitations. Dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, are\ngenerally taxed at the lower applicable capital gains rate, provided that certain holding period and other requirements\nare satisfied. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of\ncapital and first be applied against and reduce a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock, as the case\nmay be, but not below zero. Any excess will be treated as capital gain and will be treated as described below under\n\"—Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock.”\nSale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock\nUpon a sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of our Common Stock, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize\ncapital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized (not including any amount attributable to\ndeclared and unpaid dividends, which will be taxable to U.S. Holders who have not previously included such\ndividends in income as described above under \"—Distributions on Common Stock”) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted\ntax basis in our Common Stock. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.\nHolder’s holding period for our Common Stock exceeded one year at the time of disposition. Long-term capital gains\nrecognized by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally are subject to reduced rates of\ntaxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nA U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding when such holder receives\ndividend payments (including constructive dividends) or receives proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition\nof the shares of our Common Stock acquired through the exercise of Rights. Certain U.S. Holders are exempt from\nbackup withholding, including certain corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations. A U.S. Holder will be\nsubject to backup withholding if such holder is not otherwise exempt (or fails to properly establish an exemption) and\nsuch holder:\n• fails to furnish the holder’s taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily his or her\nsocial security number;\n• furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number;\n• is notified by the IRS that the holder previously failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends;\nor\n• fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the holder has furnished a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber and that the IRS has not notified the holder that the holder is subject to backup withholding.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be\nallowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification\nfor an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.\nTax Considerations Applicable to Non-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \"Non-U.S. Holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of our Common Stock,\nour Warrants, our Rights or shares of our Common Stock acquired upon exercise of Rights, as the case may be, that\nis neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity treated as a partnership (or other pass-through entity treated as a partnership)\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nReceipt, Exercise and Expiration of the Rights\nAs discussed above under \"—Tax Considerations Applicable to U.S. Holders—Receipt of Rights,” it is unclear\nwhether a Non-U.S. Holder’s receipt of Rights pursuant to the Rights Offering would be treated as a non-taxable\ndistribution with respect to its existing shares of Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock received\npursuant to the exchange or conversion of all Series A Preferred Stock prior to the record date) or Warrants, as\napplicable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If treated as a non-taxable distribution, Non-U.S. Holders will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax (or any withholding thereof) on the receipt, exercise, or expiration of the Rights.\nIf the receipt of Rights is treated as a taxable distribution, the fair market value of the Rights would be taxable to\nNon-U.S. Holders of our Common Stock as a dividend subject to withholding tax to the extent of the Non-U.S.\nHolder’s pro rata share of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, if any, with any excess being\ntreated as a return of capital to the extent thereof and then as capital gain. The Company believes that it may have\ncurrent and accumulated earnings and profits through the end of 2024. Non-U.S. Holders will not be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax (or any withholding thereof) on the exercise of the Rights. However, if the receipt of the Rights is\ntaxable and the Non-U.S. Holder allows the Rights to expire, then such shareholder should recognize a short-term\ncapital loss equal to such Non-U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Rights. A Non-U.S. Holder’s ability to use any capital\nloss may be subject to limitations.\nDistributions on Common Stock\nAs described in the section titled \"Market Price of and Dividends on Common Stock—Dividends,” we do not\nanticipate declaring or paying cash dividends to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. However, if\nwe do make distributions of cash or property on our Common Stock, such distributions will constitute dividends for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as\ndetermined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Amounts not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes will constitute a return of capital and first be applied against and reduce a Non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax\nbasis in its Common Stock, but not below zero. Any excess will be treated as capital gain and will be treated as\ndescribed below under \"—Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock.”\nSubject to the discussion below on effectively connected income, dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder will be\nsubject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends (or such lower rate\nspecified by an applicable income tax treaty, provided that the Non-U.S. Holder furnishes a valid IRS Form W-8BEN\nor W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) certifying qualification for the lower treaty rate). A Non-U.S.\nHolder that does not timely furnish the required documentation, but that qualifies for a reduced treaty rate, may\nobtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-\nU.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax\ntreaty.\nIf dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade\nor business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder\nmaintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such dividends are attributable), the Non-U.S.\nHolder will be exempt from the U.S. federal withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the Non-U.S.\nHolder must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are\neffectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States.\nAny such effectively connected dividends will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the\nregular U.S. corporate tax rate. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprofits tax at a rate of 30% as well (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively\nconnected dividends, as adjusted for certain items. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any\napplicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules.\nSale or Other Disposition of Common Stock\nA Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other\ntaxable disposition of our Common Stock unless:\n• the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the\nUnited States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a\npermanent establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable);\n• the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more\nduring the taxable year of the disposition and certain other requirements are met; or\n• our Common Stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest (\"USRPI”) by reason of our status as a U.S. real\nproperty holding corporation (\"USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income\nbasis at the regular U.S. corporate tax rate. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch\nprofits tax at a rate of 30% as well (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively\nconnected gain, as adjusted for certain items.\nA Non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate\nof 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on gain realized upon the sale or other taxable\ndisposition of our Common Stock, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even\nthough the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided that the Non-U.S. Holder has timely\nfiled U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\nWith respect to the third bullet point above, we believe we currently are not, and do not anticipate becoming, a\nUSRPHC. Because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends, however, on the fair market value of our\nUSRPIs relative to the fair market value of our non-U.S. real property interests and our other business assets, there\ncan be no assurance we currently are not a USRPHC or will not become one in the future. Even if we are or were to\nbecome a USRPHC, gain arising from the sale or other taxable disposition of our Common Stock by a Non-U.S. Holder\nwill not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if our Common Stock is \"regularly traded,” as defined by applicable\nTreasury Regulations, on an established securities market and such Non-U.S. Holder owned, actually and\nconstructively, 5% or less of our Common Stock throughout the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of\nthe sale or other taxable disposition or the Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period.\nNon-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may\nprovide for different rules.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of dividends on our Common Stock will not be subject to backup withholding, provided that the\napplicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a United States person\n(within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and the holder either certifies its non-U.S. status, such as by\nfurnishing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, or W-8ECI, or otherwise establishes an exemption. However,\ninformation returns are required to be filed with the IRS in connection with any distributions (including deemed\ndistributions) on our Common Stock paid to the Non-U.S. Holder, regardless of whether such distributions constitute\ndividends or whether any tax was actually withheld. In addition, proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition of\nour Common Stock within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers generally will not be\nsubject to backup withholding or information reporting if the applicable withholding agent receives the certification\ndescribed above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States person\n(within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds of\na disposition of our Common Stock conducted through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be\nsubject to backup withholding or information reporting.\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCopies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions of an\napplicable treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is\nestablished.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be\nallowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\nAdditional Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Foreign Accounts\nWithholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred\nto as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or \"FATCA”) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S.\nfinancial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on\ndividends (including deemed dividends) on, or (subject to the proposed Treasury Regulations discussed below)\ngross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our Common Stock paid to a \"foreign financial institution” or a\n\"non-financial foreign entity” (each as defined in the Code), unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes\ncertain diligence and reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any\n\"substantial United States owners” (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each\nsubstantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise\nqualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence\nand reporting requirements in clause (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain \"specified United\nStates persons” or \"United States owned foreign entities” (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain\ninformation about such accounts, and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial\ninstitutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an\nintergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules.\nUnder the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally\napplies to payments of dividends (including deemed dividends) on our Common Stock. While withholding under\nFATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of stock on or\nafter January 1, 2019, proposed Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds\nentirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are\nissued.\nProspective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under\nFATCA to their investment in our Common Stock.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\nBeginning on or about [•], 2024, we will distribute the Rights Certificates, Notices of Guaranteed Delivery, as\napplicable, and copies of this prospectus to individuals (excluding the PIPE Investors, who have waived their\nrespective rights to receive the Rights, and their respective affiliates to the extent holders as of the Record Date) who\nheld shares of our Common Stock and the Warrants as of the Record Date.\nIf your shares are held in the name of a custodian bank, broker, dealer or other nominee, then you should send\nyour subscription documents and subscription payment to that record holder.

Indemnification of directors and officers.\nSection 145(a) of the DGCL, which the Company is subject to, provides that a corporation may indemnify any\nperson who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit\nor proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the\ncorporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation,\nor is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines\nand amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit\nor proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not\nopposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no\nreasonable cause to believe the person’s conduct was unlawful. Section 145(b) of the DGCL provides that a\ncorporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,\npending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason\nof the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at\nthe request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint\nventure, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by\nthe person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in\na manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except\nthat no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been\nadjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in\nwhich such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but\nin view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such\nexpenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. To the extent that a present or former\ndirector or \"officer” (within the meaning of Section 145(c) of the DGCL) of a corporation has been successful on the\nmerits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145 of\nthe DGCL, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses\n(including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.\nAny indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145 of the DGCL (unless ordered by a court) shall\nbe made by the Company only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the\npresent or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the\napplicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145. Such determination shall be made,\nwith respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such\nII-1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndetermination: (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even\nthough less than a quorum; (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even\nthough less than a quorum; (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal\ncounsel in a written opinion; or (4) by the stockholders. Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an officer or\ndirector in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the\ncorporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by\nor on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is\nnot entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in Section 145. Such expenses (including attorneys’\nfees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents of the corporation or by persons\nserving at the request of the corporation as directors, officers, employees or agents of another corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the\ncorporation deems appropriate. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant\nto, Section 145 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or\nadvancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested\ndirectors or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while\nholding such office.\nSection 145 of the DGCL and the Bylaws empower the Company to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf\nof any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request\nof the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or\nother enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity,\nor arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such\nperson against such liability under Section 145.\nAccording to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, a director of the Company shall not be personally\nliable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for\nliability (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or\nomissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under\nSection 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If\nthe DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors,\nthen the liability of a director of the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the\nDGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of Article 8 of the Certificate of Incorporations by the stockholders\nof the Company shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Company with respect to events\noccurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation also provides that the Company, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of\nthe DGCL, shall indemnify all persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto. The Certificate of Incorporation and\nBylaws provide that expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil,\ncriminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit, or proceeding for which such officer or director may be entitled\nto indemnification under the Certificate of Incorporation shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final\ndisposition of such action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or\nofficer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the\nCompany as authorized thereby.\nAccording to the Bylaws, the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to\nthe Bylaws shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement\nof expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise,\nboth as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or\npersons controlling the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been\ninformed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the\npayment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in\nthe successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer\nII-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its\ncounsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the\nquestion whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be\ngoverned by the final adjudication of such issue.\nItem 15.

The Rights will expire,\nif not exercised prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024, unless extended in the Company’s sole discretion\n(such time, the \"Expiration Date”). Any Rights that are not exercised prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the\nExpiration Date will expire, have no value and cease to be exercisable for shares of Common Stock. The Company will\nnot be obligated to honor any purported exercise of Rights received by Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC,\nthe subscription agent for the Rights Offering (the \"Subscription Agent”), after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the\nExpiration Date.\nEach Right allows the holder thereof to subscribe for [•]of a share of Common Stock (the \"Basic Subscription\nRight”) at the price of $1.03 per whole share (the \"Subscription Price”). For example, if you owned 100 shares of\nCommon Stock as of the Record Date, you would receive 100 Rights and would have the right to purchase [•] shares\nof Common Stock for the Subscription Price with your Basic Subscription Rights.\nIf a Record Holder fully exercises his Basic Subscription Right (other than those rights to acquire less than one\nwhole share of Common Stock, which cannot be exercised) and other Record Holders do not fully exercise their Basic\nSubscription Rights, such holder may also exercise an over-subscription right (the \"Over-Subscription Right”) to\npurchase additional shares of Common Stock that remain unsubscribed at the expiration of the Rights Offering (such\nshares, the \"Unsubscribed Shares”), subject to availability and pro rata allocation of the Unsubscribed Shares among\nall persons exercising their Over-Subscription Right. To the extent the Unsubscribed Shares are not sufficient to\nsatisfy all of the properly exercised Over-Subscription Rights, the Unsubscribed Shares will be prorated among those\nwho properly exercised Over-Subscription Rights in proportion to their respective Basic Subscription Rights. To the\nextent the holders properly exercise their Over-Subscription Rights for an aggregate amount of shares that is less\nthan the number of the Unsubscribed Shares, each Rights holder will be allocated the full number of Unsubscribed\nShares for which each such holder actually paid in connection with the Over-Subscription Right. The remaining\nshares of Common Stock will be allocated among all other holders exercising the Over-Subscription Right on the same\npro rata basis described above.\nEach Record Holder will be required to submit payment in full for all the shares such holder wishes to buy with\nhis or her Basic Subscription Right(s) and Over-Subscription Right(s). Because the total number of Unsubscribed\nShares will not be known prior to the expiration of the Rights Offering, if a Record Holder wishes to maximize the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock he or she may purchase pursuant to such holder’s Over-Subscription Right(s),\nsuch holder will need to deliver payment in an amount equal to the aggregate Subscription Price for the maximum\ninvestment amount that the Record Holder wishes to invest, assuming that no holder other than such Record Holder\npurchases any Shares pursuant to their Basic Subscription Rights and Over-Subscription Rights.\nThe Company will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. If the number of Rights\nyou exercise would otherwise permit you to purchase a fraction of a share, the number of shares of Common Stock\nthat you may purchase will be rounded down to the nearest whole share. Any excess subscription payments received\nby the Subscription Agent will be returned, without interest or penalty, as soon as practicable.\nThe Company will not be required to issue Shares to you if the Subscription Agent does not receive your\npayment prior to the Expiration Date, regardless of when you send the subscription payment and related documents,\nunless you send the documents in compliance with the guaranteed delivery procedures described below. The\nCompany may extend the Expiration Date by giving written notice to the Subscription Agent before the expiration of\nthe Rights Offering. If the Company elects to extend the Expiration Date, it will issue a press release announcing such\nextension no later than 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the next business day after the most recently announced Expiration\nDate. The Rights held by each Record Holder are evidenced by subscription rights certificates (the \"Rights\nCertificates”). The Rights are non-transferable and may not be sold, transferred, assigned or given away to anyone,\nexcept by operation of law (e.g., by death) or by such holders that are closed-end funds to funds affiliated with such\nholders.\nDo not send the Rights Certificate or payment to the Company. If you wish to participate in the Rights Offering,\nthe Subscription Agent must receive your properly completed and duly executed Rights Certificate and any other\nrequired document, with full payment of the aggregate Subscription Price, including final clearance of any checks,\nbefore 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date. Once you have exercised your Rights, you may not\ncancel, revoke or otherwise amend the exercise of your Rights. Any Rights that are not exercised prior to the\nExpiration Date will be void, of no value and will cease to be exercisable for shares of Common Stock, and you will\nhave no further rights under them.\nThe number of Shares you own is printed on the face of your Rights Certificate. The number of Shares printed\non the face of the Rights Certificate can be used to help you determine your percentage ownership for the purposes\nof determining the amount you elect to subscribe for pursuant to the Over-Subscription Right. You should indicate\nyour wishes with regard to the exercise of your Rights by completing the appropriate portions of your Rights\nCertificate and returning the certificate to the Subscription Agent in the envelope provided.\nYOUR RIGHTS CERTIFICATES, OR NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY, AND FULL SUBSCRIPTION PRICE\nPAYMENT FOR EACH RIGHT THAT IS EXERCISED PURSUANT TO THE BASIC SUBSCRIPTION RIGHT PLUS\nTHE FULL SUBSCRIPTION PRICE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF SHARES SUBSCRIBED FOR\nPURSUANT TO THE OVER-SUBSCRIPTION RIGHT, INCLUDING FINAL CLEARANCE OF ANY CHECKS, MUST\nBE RECEIVED BY THE SUBSCRIPTION AGENT, ON OR BEFORE 5:00 P.M., EASTERN TIME, ON THE\nEXPIRATION DATE.

Record Holders who exercise their Basic Subscription Right in full may also subscribe for\nadditional Shares that remain unsubscribed at the Expiration Date at the same Subscription Price (such shares, the\n\"Unsubscribed Shares”), subject availability (the \"Over-Subscription Right”).\nThere is no minimum number of Shares any Record Holder must purchase, but Record Holders may not purchase\nfractional Shares. If the number of Rights exercised by the holder thereof would otherwise permit such holder to\npurchase a fraction of a share, the number of Shares that such holder may purchase will be rounded down to the\nnearest whole share. Any excess subscription payments received by Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC (the\n\"Subscription Agent”) will be returned, without interest or penalty, as soon as practicable after the termination of the\nRights Offering.\nEach Rights holder will be required to submit payment in full for all the shares it wishes to buy with its Basic\nSubscription Right and its Over-Subscription Right. Because the Company will not know the total number of\nUnsubscribed Shares prior to the Expiration Date, if a Rights holder wishes to maximize the number of shares it may\npurchase pursuant to his Over-Subscription Right(s), such holder will need to deliver payment in an amount equal to\nthe aggregate Subscription Price for the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available to the such holder,\nassuming that no holders other than such holder purchases any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Basic\nSubscription Right and Over-Subscription Right.\nIf you wish to exercise your Over-Subscription Right, you should indicate the number of additional Shares you\nwould like to subscribe for in the space provided on the enclosed instructions. When you send in that information,\nyou must also send the full purchase price for the number of additional Shares that you have requested (in addition\nto the payment due for Shares purchased through your Basic Subscription Right).\nTo the extent the Record Holders properly exercise their Over-Subscription Rights for an aggregate amount of\nshares that is less than the number of the Unsubscribed Shares, each Record Holder will be allocated the full number\nof Unsubscribed Shares for which each such holder actually paid in connection with the Over-Subscription Right.\nThe remaining shares of Common Stock will be allocated among all other holders exercising the Over-Subscription\nRight on a pro rata basis in proportion to their respective Basic Subscription Rights.\nIf an insufficient number of Unsubscribed Shares is available to fully satisfy all of the proper Over-Subscription\nRight requests, the available Unsubscribed Shares will be prorated among those rights holders who properly\nexercised Over-Subscription Rights in proportion to their respective Basic Subscription Rights. To the extent you\nproperly exercise your Over-Subscription Right for an amount of Shares that exceeds the number of unsubscribed\nShares available to you, any excess subscription payment received by the Subscription Agent will be returned to\nyou, without interest or penalty, as soon as practicable after the termination of the Rights Offering. We are (or our\nnominee is) the Record Holder of the Common Stock held by us for your account. We can exercise your Rights only\nif you instruct us to do so.\nWe have enclosed your copy of the Prospectus and corresponding subscription instructions.\nThe Rights will expire if not exercised prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on [•], 2024 (such time, the\n\"Expiration Date”), subject to extension in the Company’s sole discretion. Any Rights not exercised prior to the\nExpiration Date will expire and will have no value. Any subscription for Shares made in the Rights Offering cannot be\nrevoked, changed or cancelled.\nThe materials enclosed are being forwarded to you as the beneficial owner of the Common Stock carried by us in\nyour account but not registered in your name. Exercises of Rights may be made only by us as the Record Holder and\npursuant to your instructions. Accordingly, we request instructions as to whether you wish us to elect to subscribe\nfor any Shares to which you are entitled pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the\nProspectus. However, we urge you to read the Prospectus and other enclosed materials carefully before instructing\nus to exercise your Rights.\nYour instructions to us should be forwarded as promptly as possible in order to permit us to exercise Rights on\nyour behalf in accordance with the provisions of the Rights Offering prior to the Expiration Date.\nIf you wish to have us, on your behalf, exercise the Rights for any Shares to which you are entitled, please so\ninstruct us by completing, executing and returning to us the \"Beneficial Owner Election Form” included herewith.\nIf you have any questions concerning the Rights Offering, you should contact your broker and/or nominee. For\nother questions regarding the details of the offer, you can contact Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC, the\nInformation Agent, by telephone ((888) 789-8409) or by email (shareholder@broadridge.com).\nVery truly yours,\nLazydays Holdings, Inc.\n2\nExhibit 99.5\nBENEFICIAL OWNER ELECTION FORM\nThe undersigned acknowledge(s) receipt of your letter and the enclosed materials referred to therein relating to\nthe distribution in a rights offering (the \"Rights Offering”) by Lazydays Holdings, Inc.

The Record Holders will receive, at no charge, non-transferable subscription\nrights (the \"Rights”) to purchase up to an aggregate of $25,000,000 of shares of Common Stock (the \"Shares”) at a\nsubscription price of $1.03 per whole Share (the \"Subscription Price”).\nEach Record Holder will receive one Right for each share of the Common Stock (including shares of Common\nStock issuable upon exercise or conversion of the Warrants and the Series A Preferred Stock) that such Record\nHolder owned on the Record Date. Each Right allows the holder thereof to subscribe for [•] of a share of Common\nStock (the \"Basic Subscription Right”) at the Subscription Price. For example, if a Rights holder owned 100 shares of\nCommon Stock as of the Record Date, it would receive 100 Rights and would have the right to purchase [•] shares of\nCommon Stock for the Subscription Price per share with the Basic Subscription Right. If a Rights holder fully\nexercises his Basic Subscription Right (other than those rights to acquire less than one whole share of Common\nStock, which cannot be exercised) and other Rights holders do not fully exercise their Basic Subscription Rights, he\nmay also exercise an over-subscription right (the \"Over-Subscription Right”) to purchase additional shares of\nCommon Stock that remain unsubscribed at the expiration of the Rights Offering (such shares, the \"Unsubscribed\nShares”), subject to availability and pro rata allocation of shares among persons exercising their Over-Subscription\nRight. The Company will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock in the Rights Offering. If the number of Rights\nexercised by the holder thereof would otherwise permit such holder to purchase a fraction of a share, the number of\nshares Common Stock that such holder may purchase will be rounded down to the nearest whole share.\nWith respect to any instructions to exercise (or not to exercise) Rights, the undersigned acknowledges that this\nform must be completed and returned such that it will actually be received by you by 5:00 p.m., New York City time,\non [•], 2024, the scheduled expiration date of the Rights Offering.\nThis will instruct you whether to exercise Rights to purchase Shares distributed with respect to the shares of\nCommon Stock held by you for the account of the undersigned, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions\nset forth in the Prospectus and corresponding subscription instructions.\nI (we) hereby instruct you as follows:\n(CHECK THE APPLICABLE BOXES AND PROVIDE ALL REQUIRED INFORMATION)\nBox 1. ☐ Please DO NOT EXERCISE RIGHTS for Shares.\nBox 2. ☐ Please EXERCISE RIGHTS for Shares as set forth below:\nNumber of Whole\nShares Subscribed Subscription\nfor Price Payment\nBasic Subscription Right x $1.03 = $ (Line 1)\nOver-Subscription Right x $1.03 = $ (Line 1)\nTotal Payment Required $ (Sum of Lines 1 and 2)\nBox 3. ☐ Payment in the following amount is enclosed: $\nBox 4. ☐ Please deduct payment of $ from the following account maintained by you as follows: (The\ntotal of Box 3 and Box 4 must equal the total payment specified above.)\nType of Account:\nAccount No.:\nI (we) on my (our) own behalf, or on behalf of any person(s) on whose behalf, or under whose directions, I am\n(we are) signing this form:\n☐ irrevocably elect to invest the amount indicated above to purchase Shares upon the terms and conditions\nspecified in the prospectus; and\n☐ agree that if I (we) fail to deliver the amount I (we) have elected to invest, you may exercise any remedies\navailable to you under law.\nName of Beneficial Owner(s):\nSignature of Beneficial Owner(s):\nIf you are signing in your capacity as a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, agent, officer\nof a corporation or another acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, please provide the following information:\nName:\nCapacity:\nAddress (including zip code):\nTelephone Number:\n2\nExhibit 99.6\nNOMINEE HOLDER CERTIFICATION\nThe undersigned, a broker, dealer, custodian bank, trustee, depositary or other nominee holder of subscription\nrights (the \"Rights”) to purchase shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \"Common Stock”) of\nLazydays Holdings, Inc.
