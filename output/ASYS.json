(\"Amtech\") (NASDAQ: ASYS), a manufacturer of equipment and consumables for semiconductor fabrication and packaging, today reported results for its third quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial and Operational Results:**\n\n  * Net revenue of $26.7 million \n  * GAAP operating income of $0.8 million \n  * Net cash position of $8.9 million \n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $1.5 million (1)\n  * GAAP net income of $0.4 million \n  * Non-GAAP net income of $1.1 million (1)\n  * Customer orders of $18.8 million \n  * Backlog of $31.8 million \n\n\n\n(1) See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in schedules following this release. \n\n“In the third quarter we continued to align our cost structure with current market conditions and lay the foundation for meaningful operating leverage as our markets recover. Revenue of $26.7 million exceeded the high-end of our guidance range, and we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 million. This is the third consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow. I am pleased that we are seeing the financial benefits of the approximately $7 million of annualized operating cost reductions taken over the past few quarters,” commented Mr. Bob Daigle, Chief Executive Officer of Amtech. \n\n**GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Results**\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts)  |  **Q3** |  **Q2** |  **Q3** |  **9 Months** |  **9 Months**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**FY 2024** |  **FY 2024** |  **FY 2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRevenues, net  |  $  |  26.7  |  $  |  25.4  |  $  |  30.7  |  $  |  77.1  |  $  |  85.6   \nGross profit  |  $  |  9.8  |  $  |  8.5  |  $  |  11.0  |  $  |  26.4  |  $  |  32.8   \n_Gross margin_ |  _36.5_ |  _%_ |  _33.2_ |  _%_ |  _35.7_ |  _%_ |  _34.3_ |  _%_ |  _38.3_ |  _%_  \nNon-GAAP gross profit (1) |  $  |  9.8  |  $  |  8.6  |  $  |  11.0  |  $  |  27.7  |  $  |  32.8   \n_Non-GAAP gross margin(1)_ |  _36.5_ |  _%_ |  _33.9_ |  _%_ |  _35.7_ |  _%_ |  _36.0_ |  _%_ |  _38.3_ |  _%_  \nGAAP operating income (loss)  |  $  |  0.8  |  $  |  1.4  |  $  |  (1.1  |  )  |  $  |  (6.8  |  )  |  $  |  (3.3  |  )   \n_GAAP operating margin_ |  _3.1_ |  _%_ |  _5.4_ |  _%_ |  _-3.6_ |  _%_ |  _-8.8_ |  _%_ |  _-3.8_ |  _%_  \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) (1) |  $  |  1.5  |  $  |  0.2  |  $  |  0.4  |  $  |  1.5  |  $  |  2.9   \n_Non-GAAP operating margin(1)_ |  _5.6_ |  _%_ |  _0.7_ |  _%_ |  _1.2_ |  _%_ |  _1.9_ |  _%_ |  _3.3_ |  _%_  \nGAAP net income (loss)  |  $  |  0.4  |  $  |  1.0  |  $  |  (1.0  |  )  |  $  |  (8.0  |  )  |  $  |  (0.6  |  )   \nGAAP net income (loss) per diluted share  |  $  |  0.03  |  $  |  0.07  |  $  |  (0.07  |  )  |  $  |  (0.56  |  )  |  $  |  (0.04  |  )   \nNon-GAAP net income (loss) (1) |  $  |  1.1  |  $  |  (0.2  |  )  |  $  |  0.3  |  $  |  0.3  |  $  |  2.2   \nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share (1) |  $  |  0.08  |  $  |  (0.01  |  )  |  $  |  0.02  |  $  |  0.02  |  $  |  0.16   \n  \n(1) See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in schedules following this release. \n\nNet revenues increased 5% sequentially and decreased 13% from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The sequential increase is primarily due to increased sales of our reflow and wafer cleaning equipment, and higher parts and services revenue. The decrease from prior year is primarily attributable to lower sales across most of our product portfolio due to a slow-down in the broader semiconductor market. \n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, GAAP gross margin increased sequentially compared to the same prior year period. On a sequential basis, GAAP gross margin in our Semiconductor segment was positively affected by product mix attributed to increased revenues for reflow equipment, parts and services. GAAP gross margin in our Materials and Substrate segment decreased on a sequential basis due primarily to a less favorable product mix of consumables and equipment. Compared to the same prior year period, GAAP gross margin was relatively consistent between periods. \n\nSelling, General & Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased by approximately $40,000 on a sequential basis and decreased $2.1 million compared to the prior year period. The sequential decrease is due primarily to reductions in labor-related expenses, partially offset by increased commissions and shipping expenses on higher sales. Compared to the same prior year period, the decrease is due primarily to lower labor and labor-related expenses as a result of our cost reduction initiatives, as well as lower shipping expenses on lower revenues. \n\nResearch, Development and Engineering expenses decreased $0.2 million sequentially and decreased $1.1 million compared to the same prior year period, with the sequential decrease due primarily to the timing of purchases related to specific projects in both segments, and the decrease from prior year attributable to development efforts in our Material & Substrate segment that did not recur. \n\nGAAP operating income was $0.8 million, compared to GAAP operating income of $1.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and GAAP operating loss of $1.1 million in the same prior year period. \n\nNon-GAAP operating income was $1.5 million, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and non-GAAP operating income of $0.4 million in the same prior year period. \n\nGAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.4 million, or 3 cents per share. This compares to GAAP net income of $1.0 million, or 7 cents per share, for the preceding quarter and GAAP net loss of $1.0 million, or 7 cents per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. \n\nNon-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.1 million, or 8 cents per share. This compares to non-GAAP net loss of $0.2 million, or 1 cent per share, for the preceding quarter and non-GAAP net income of $0.3 million, or 2 cents per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. \n\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2024, were $13.2 million, compared to $13.1 million at September 30, 2023. Debt payments during the three months ended June 30, 2024 were $0.3 million. Net cash as of June 30, 2024 was $8.9 million compared to $2.4 million as of September 30, 2023. \n\nIn discussing financial results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 and the three months ended June 30, 2024, in this press release, the Company refers to certain financial measures that are adjusted from the financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). All non-GAAP amounts exclude certain adjustments for stock compensation expense, severance expense, expenses related to the discontinued product line, gain on the sale of our Arizona headquarters, moving expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition expenses, and income tax benefit related to our acquisition of Entrepix, Inc. A tabular reconciliation of financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nOperating results can be significantly impacted, positively or negatively, by the timing of orders, system shipments, logistical challenges, and the financial results of semiconductor manufacturers. Additionally, the semiconductor equipment industries can be cyclical and inherently impacted by changes in market demand. Actual results may differ materially in the weeks and months ahead. \n\nFor the fourth fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, we expect revenues in the range of $22 - 25 million with adjusted EBITDA nominally positive. Although the near-term outlook for revenue and earnings remains challenging, we remain confident that the future prospects are strong for both our consumables and equipment serving advanced mobility and advanced packaging applications. We took actions during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024, which will reduce Amtech's structural costs by approximately $7 million annually and better align product pricing with value. These steps should significantly improve results and enhance profitability through market cycles. \n\nA portion of Amtech's results is denominated in Renminbis, a Chinese currency. The outlook provided in this press release is based on an assumed exchange rate between the United States Dollar and the Renminbi. Changes in the value of the Renminbi in relation to the United States Dollar could cause actual results to differ from expectations. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAmtech Systems will host a conference call at 5:00 pm ET on Wednesday, August 7, 2024 to discuss our fiscal third quarter financial results. The call will be available to interested parties by dialing 1-800-717-1738. For international callers, please dial +1-646-307-1865.

(\"Amtech\") (NASDAQ: ASYS), a manufacturer of thermal processing, wafer cleaning and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) capital equipment and related consumables used in semiconductor, advanced mobility and renewable energy manufacturing applications, today reported results for its second quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n\n**Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial and Operational Results:**\n\n  * Net revenue of $25.4 million \n  * GAAP operating income of $1.4 million \n  * Net proceeds of $2.5 million from sale of corporate headquarters building \n  * Debt payments of $6.4 million, ending the quarter with net cash position of $8.8 million \n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $0.2 million (1)\n  * GAAP net income of $1.0 million \n  * Non-GAAP net loss of $0.2 million (1)\n  * Customer orders of $19.8 million \n  * Backlog of $44.3 million \n\n\n\n(1) See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in schedules following this release. \n\n“In the second quarter of fiscal 2024 we benefited from improvements in our cost structure and operational effectiveness. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance range with revenue of $25.4 million and, more importantly, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $0.8 million despite continued softness in overall market demand. Over the past few quarters, we have better aligned the size of our organization to support current market demand and believe we have positioned the company to deliver strong operating results as the broader semiconductor market recovers,” commented Mr. Bob Daigle, Chief Executive Officer of Amtech. \n\n**GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Results**\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts)  |  **Q2** |  **Q1** |  **Q2** |  **6 Months** |  **6 Months**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**FY 2024** |  **FY 2024** |  **FY 2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRevenues, net  |  $  |  25.4  |  $  |  24.9  |  $  |  33.3  |  $  |  50.4  |  $  |  54.9   \nGross profit  |  $  |  8.5  |  $  |  8.2  |  $  |  13.5  |  $  |  16.7  |  $  |  21.8   \n_Gross margin_ |  _33.2_ |  _%_ |  _33.0_ |  _%_ |  _40.4_ |  _%_ |  _33.1_ |  _%_ |  _39.7_ |  _%_  \nNon-GAAP gross profit (1) |  $  |  8.6  |  $  |  9.3  |  $  |  13.5  |  $  |  18.0  |  $  |  21.8   \n_Non-GAAP gross margin(1)_ |  _33.9_ |  _%_ |  _37.5_ |  _%_ |  _40.4_ |  _%_ |  _35.7_ |  _%_ |  _39.7_ |  _%_  \nGAAP operating income (loss)  |  $  |  1.4  |  $  |  (8.9  |  )  |  $  |  0.5  |  $  |  (7.6  |  )  |  $  |  (2.2  |  )   \n_GAAP operating margin_ |  _5.4_ |  _%_ |  _-35.9_ |  _%_ |  _1.6_ |  _%_ |  _-15.0_ |  _%_ |  _-3.9_ |  _%_  \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) (1) |  $  |  0.2  |  $  |  (0.2  |  )  |  $  |  3.2  |  $  |  (0.0  |  )  |  $  |  2.5   \n_Non-GAAP operating margin(1)_ |  _0.7_ |  _%_ |  _-0.8_ |  _%_ |  _9.5_ |  _%_ |  _0.0_ |  _%_ |  _4.5_ |  _%_  \nGAAP net income (loss)  |  $  |  1.0  |  $  |  (9.4  |  )  |  $  |  3.2  |  $  |  (8.4  |  )  |  $  |  0.5   \nGAAP net income (loss) per diluted share  |  $  |  0.07  |  $  |  (0.66  |  )  |  $  |  0.23  |  $  |  (0.59  |  )  |  $  |  0.03   \nNon-GAAP net (loss) income (1) |  $  |  (0.2  |  )  |  $  |  (0.6  |  )  |  $  |  2.7  |  $  |  (0.8  |  )  |  $  |  1.9   \nNon-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted share (1) |  $  |  (0.01  |  )  |  $  |  (0.04  |  )  |  $  |  0.19  |  $  |  (0.06  |  )  |  $  |  0.14   \n(1) See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in schedules following this release.   \n  \nNet revenues increased 2% sequentially and decreased 24% from the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The sequential increase is primarily due to increased consumable sales in our Material and Substrate segment, as customers update their buying patterns and adjust inventory levels. The decrease from prior year is primarily attributable to lower sales across most of our product portfolio due to a slow-down in the broader semiconductor market. \n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2024, GAAP gross margin was flat sequentially and decreased compared to the same prior year period. In our semiconductor segment, GAAP gross margin was negatively affected by product mix and increased material costs, both primarily attributed to shipments of our horizontal diffusion furnaces. GAAP gross margin in our Material and Substrate segment increased sequentially and compared to the same prior year period due primarily to a more favorable product mix, with increased consumable sales partially offset by lower equipment sales. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased sequentially and compared to the same prior year period due primarily to a less favorable product mix and increased material costs, both primarily attributed to shipments of our horizontal diffusion furnaces. \n\nSelling, General & Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased $0.3 million on a sequential basis and decreased $3.2 million compared to the prior year period. The sequential decrease is due primarily to reductions in labor expenses and lower commissions and shipping expenses. Compared to the same prior year period, the decrease is due primarily to $1.5 million of lower acquisition expenses, $0.6 million of lower amortization expense, and reductions in labor, commissions and shipping expenses. \n\nResearch, Development and Engineering expenses decreased $0.7 million sequentially and decreased $0.6 million compared to the same prior year period due primarily to the timing of purchases related to specific projects in our Semiconductor segment. \n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we sold our corporate headquarters building in Tempe, Arizona for a gain of $2.2 million and net cash proceeds of $2.5 million. \n\nGAAP operating income was $1.4 million, compared to GAAP operating loss of $8.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and GAAP operating income of $0.5 million in the same prior year period. \n\nNon-GAAP operating income was $0.2 million, compared to non-GAAP operating loss of $0.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and non-GAAP operating income of $3.2 million in the same prior year period. \n\nGAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.0 million, or 7 cents per share. This compares to GAAP net loss of $9.4 million, or 66 cents per share, for the preceding quarter and GAAP net income of $3.2 million, or 23 cents per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. \n\nNon-GAAP net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.2 million, or 1 cent per share. This compares to non-GAAP net loss of $0.6 million, or 4 cents per share, for the preceding quarter and non-GAAP net income of $2.7 million, or 19 cents per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. \n\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2024, were $13.0 million, compared to $13.1 million at September 30, 2023. Debt payments during the three months ended March 31, 2024 were $6.4 million. Net cash as of March 31, 2024 was $8.8 million compared to $7.0 million as of December 31, 2023. \n\nIn discussing financial results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 and the three months ended December 31, 2023, in this press release, the Company refers to certain financial measures that are adjusted from the financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). All non-GAAP amounts exclude certain adjustments for stock compensation expense, severance expense, expenses related to the discontinued product line, intangible asset impairment, gain on the sale of our Arizona headquarters, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition expenses, and income tax benefit related to our acquisition of Entrepix, Inc. A tabular reconciliation of financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nOperating results can be significantly impacted, positively or negatively, by the timing of orders, system shipments, logistical challenges, and the financial results of semiconductor manufacturers. Additionally, the semiconductor equipment industries can be cyclical and inherently impacted by changes in market demand. Actual results may differ materially in the weeks and months ahead. \n\nFor the third fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, we expect revenues in the range of $22 - 25 million with adjusted EBITDA nominally positive, which includes some expenses and production downtime with the BTU facility move. Although the near-term outlook for revenue and earnings remains challenging, we remain confident that the future prospects are strong for both our consumables and equipment serving advanced mobility and advanced packaging applications. We took actions during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024, which will reduce Amtech's structural costs by approximately $6 million annually and better align product pricing with value. These steps should significantly improve results and enhance profitability through market cycles. \n\nA portion of Amtech's results is denominated in Renminbis, a Chinese currency. The outlook provided in this press release is based on an assumed exchange rate between the United States Dollar and the Renminbi. Changes in the value of the Renminbi in relation to the United States Dollar could cause actual results to differ from expectations. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAmtech Systems will host a conference call at 5:00 pm ET on Wednesday, May 8, 2024 to discuss our fiscal second quarter financial results. The call will be available to interested parties by dialing 1-888-886-7786. For international callers, please dial +1-416-764-8658. A live webcast of the conference call will be available in the Investor Relations section of Amtech’s website at: <https://www.amtechsystems.com/investors/events>. \n\nA replay of the webcast will be available in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website at <http://www.amtechsystems.com/conference.htm> shortly after the conclusion of the call and will remain available for approximately 30 calendar days. \n\n**About Amtech Systems, Inc.**\n\nAmtech Systems, Inc. is a leading, global manufacturer of thermal processing, wafer cleaning and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) capital equipment and related consumables used in semiconductor, advanced mobility and renewable energy manufacturing applications.

(\"Amtech\") (NASDAQ: ASYS), a manufacturer of equipment and consumables for semiconductor fabrication and packaging, today reported results for its third quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial and Operational Results:**\n\n  * Net revenue of $26.7 million \n  * GAAP operating income of $0.8 million \n  * Net cash position of $8.9 million \n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $1.5 million (1)\n  * GAAP net income of $0.4 million \n  * Non-GAAP net income of $1.1 million (1)\n  * Customer orders of $18.8 million \n  * Backlog of $31.8 million \n\n\n\n(1) See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in schedules following this release. \n\n“In the third quarter we continued to align our cost structure with current market conditions and lay the foundation for meaningful operating leverage as our markets recover. Revenue of $26.7 million exceeded the high-end of our guidance range, and we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 million. This is the third consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow. I am pleased that we are seeing the financial benefits of the approximately $7 million of annualized operating cost reductions taken over the past few quarters,” commented Mr. Bob Daigle, Chief Executive Officer of Amtech. \n\n**GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Results**\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts)  |  **Q3** |  **Q2** |  **Q3** |  **9 Months** |  **9 Months**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**FY 2024** |  **FY 2024** |  **FY 2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRevenues, net  |  $  |  26.7  |  $  |  25.4  |  $  |  30.7  |  $  |  77.1  |  $  |  85.6   \nGross profit  |  $  |  9.8  |  $  |  8.5  |  $  |  11.0  |  $  |  26.4  |  $  |  32.8   \n_Gross margin_ |  _36.5_ |  _%_ |  _33.2_ |  _%_ |  _35.7_ |  _%_ |  _34.3_ |  _%_ |  _38.3_ |  _%_  \nNon-GAAP gross profit (1) |  $  |  9.8  |  $  |  8.6  |  $  |  11.0  |  $  |  27.7  |  $  |  32.8   \n_Non-GAAP gross margin(1)_ |  _36.5_ |  _%_ |  _33.9_ |  _%_ |  _35.7_ |  _%_ |  _36.0_ |  _%_ |  _38.3_ |  _%_  \nGAAP operating income (loss)  |  $  |  0.8  |  $  |  1.4  |  $  |  (1.1  |  )  |  $  |  (6.8  |  )  |  $  |  (3.3  |  )   \n_GAAP operating margin_ |  _3.1_ |  _%_ |  _5.4_ |  _%_ |  _-3.6_ |  _%_ |  _-8.8_ |  _%_ |  _-3.8_ |  _%_  \nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) (1) |  $  |  1.5  |  $  |  0.2  |  $  |  0.4  |  $  |  1.5  |  $  |  2.9   \n_Non-GAAP operating margin(1)_ |  _5.6_ |  _%_ |  _0.7_ |  _%_ |  _1.2_ |  _%_ |  _1.9_ |  _%_ |  _3.3_ |  _%_  \nGAAP net income (loss)  |  $  |  0.4  |  $  |  1.0  |  $  |  (1.0  |  )  |  $  |  (8.0  |  )  |  $  |  (0.6  |  )   \nGAAP net income (loss) per diluted share  |  $  |  0.03  |  $  |  0.07  |  $  |  (0.07  |  )  |  $  |  (0.56  |  )  |  $  |  (0.04  |  )   \nNon-GAAP net income (loss) (1) |  $  |  1.1  |  $  |  (0.2  |  )  |  $  |  0.3  |  $  |  0.3  |  $  |  2.2   \nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share (1) |  $  |  0.08  |  $  |  (0.01  |  )  |  $  |  0.02  |  $  |  0.02  |  $  |  0.16   \n  \n(1) See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in schedules following this release. \n\nNet revenues increased 5% sequentially and decreased 13% from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The sequential increase is primarily due to increased sales of our reflow and wafer cleaning equipment, and higher parts and services revenue. The decrease from prior year is primarily attributable to lower sales across most of our product portfolio due to a slow-down in the broader semiconductor market. \n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, GAAP gross margin increased sequentially compared to the same prior year period. On a sequential basis, GAAP gross margin in our Semiconductor segment was positively affected by product mix attributed to increased revenues for reflow equipment, parts and services. GAAP gross margin in our Materials and Substrate segment decreased on a sequential basis due primarily to a less favorable product mix of consumables and equipment. Compared to the same prior year period, GAAP gross margin was relatively consistent between periods. \n\nSelling, General & Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased by approximately $40,000 on a sequential basis and decreased $2.1 million compared to the prior year period. The sequential decrease is due primarily to reductions in labor-related expenses, partially offset by increased commissions and shipping expenses on higher sales. Compared to the same prior year period, the decrease is due primarily to lower labor and labor-related expenses as a result of our cost reduction initiatives, as well as lower shipping expenses on lower revenues. \n\nResearch, Development and Engineering expenses decreased $0.2 million sequentially and decreased $1.1 million compared to the same prior year period, with the sequential decrease due primarily to the timing of purchases related to specific projects in both segments, and the decrease from prior year attributable to development efforts in our Material & Substrate segment that did not recur. \n\nGAAP operating income was $0.8 million, compared to GAAP operating income of $1.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and GAAP operating loss of $1.1 million in the same prior year period. \n\nNon-GAAP operating income was $1.5 million, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and non-GAAP operating income of $0.4 million in the same prior year period. \n\nGAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.4 million, or 3 cents per share. This compares to GAAP net income of $1.0 million, or 7 cents per share, for the preceding quarter and GAAP net loss of $1.0 million, or 7 cents per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. \n\nNon-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.1 million, or 8 cents per share. This compares to non-GAAP net loss of $0.2 million, or 1 cent per share, for the preceding quarter and non-GAAP net income of $0.3 million, or 2 cents per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. \n\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2024, were $13.2 million, compared to $13.1 million at September 30, 2023. Debt payments during the three months ended June 30, 2024 were $0.3 million. Net cash as of June 30, 2024 was $8.9 million compared to $2.4 million as of September 30, 2023. \n\nIn discussing financial results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 and the three months ended June 30, 2024, in this press release, the Company refers to certain financial measures that are adjusted from the financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). All non-GAAP amounts exclude certain adjustments for stock compensation expense, severance expense, expenses related to the discontinued product line, gain on the sale of our Arizona headquarters, moving expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition expenses, and income tax benefit related to our acquisition of Entrepix, Inc. A tabular reconciliation of financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nOperating results can be significantly impacted, positively or negatively, by the timing of orders, system shipments, logistical challenges, and the financial results of semiconductor manufacturers. Additionally, the semiconductor equipment industries can be cyclical and inherently impacted by changes in market demand. Actual results may differ materially in the weeks and months ahead. \n\nFor the fourth fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, we expect revenues in the range of $22 - 25 million with adjusted EBITDA nominally positive. Although the near-term outlook for revenue and earnings remains challenging, we remain confident that the future prospects are strong for both our consumables and equipment serving advanced mobility and advanced packaging applications. We took actions during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024, which will reduce Amtech's structural costs by approximately $7 million annually and better align product pricing with value. These steps should significantly improve results and enhance profitability through market cycles. \n\nA portion of Amtech's results is denominated in Renminbis, a Chinese currency. The outlook provided in this press release is based on an assumed exchange rate between the United States Dollar and the Renminbi. Changes in the value of the Renminbi in relation to the United States Dollar could cause actual results to differ from expectations. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAmtech Systems will host a conference call at 5:00 pm ET on Wednesday, August 7, 2024 to discuss our fiscal third quarter financial results. The call will be available to interested parties by dialing 1-800-717-1738. For international callers, please dial +1-646-307-1865.

The sequential increase is primarily due to increased sales of our reflow and wafer\ncleaning equipment, and higher parts and services revenue. The decrease from prior year is\nprimarily attributable to lower sales across most of our product portfolio due to a slow-down\nin the broader semiconductor market.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, GAAP gross margin increased sequentially compared to\nthe same prior year period. On a sequential basis, GAAP gross margin in our Semiconductor\nsegment was positively affected by product mix attributed to increased revenues for reflow\nequipment, parts and services. GAAP gross margin in our Materials and Substrate segment\ndecreased on a sequential basis due primarily to a less favorable product mix of\nconsumables and equipment. Compared to the same prior year period, GAAP gross margin\nwas relatively consistent between periods.\nSelling, General & Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased by approximately $40,000\non a sequential basis and decreased $2.1 million compared to the prior year period. The\nsequential decrease is due primarily to reductions in labor-related expenses, partially offset\nby increased commissions and shipping expenses on higher sales. Compared to the same\nprior year period, the decrease is due primarily to lower labor and labor-related expenses as\na result of our cost reduction initiatives, as well as lower shipping expenses on lower\nrevenues.\nResearch, Development and Engineering expenses decreased $0.2 million sequentially and\ndecreased $1.1 million compared to the same prior year period, with the sequential\ndecrease due primarily to the timing of purchases related to specific projects in both\nsegments, and the decrease from prior year attributable to development efforts in our\nMaterial & Substrate segment that did not recur.\nGAAP operating income was $0.8 million, compared to GAAP operating income of $1.4\nmillion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and GAAP operating loss of $1.1 million in the\nsame prior year period.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $1.5 million, compared to non-GAAP operating income of\n$0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and non-GAAP operating income of $0.4\nmillion in the same prior year period.\nGAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.4 million, or 3 cents per share.\nThis compares to GAAP net income of $1.0 million, or 7 cents per share, for the preceding\nquarter and GAAP net loss of $1.0 million, or 7 cents per share, for the third quarter of fiscal\n2023.\nNon-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.1 million, or 8 cents per\nshare. This compares to non-GAAP net loss of $0.2 million, or 1 cent per share, for the\npreceding quarter and non-GAAP net income of $0.3 million, or 2 cents per share, for the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2023.\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2024, were $13.2 million, compared to\n$13.1 million at September 30, 2023. Debt payments during the three months ended June\n30, 2024 were $0.3 million. Net cash as of June 30, 2024 was $8.9 million compared to $2.4\nmillion as of September 30, 2023.\nIn discussing financial results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nand the three months ended June 30, 2024, in this press release, the Company refers to\ncertain financial measures that are adjusted from the financial results prepared in\naccordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). All non-\nGAAP amounts exclude certain adjustments for stock compensation expense, severance\nexpense, expenses related to the discontinued product line, gain on the sale of our Arizona\nheadquarters, moving expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition\nexpenses, and income tax benefit related to our acquisition of Entrepix, Inc. A tabular\nreconciliation of financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures is included at the end of this press release.\nOutlook\nOperating results can be significantly impacted, positively or negatively, by the timing of\norders, system shipments, logistical challenges, and the financial results of semiconductor\nmanufacturers. Additionally, the semiconductor equipment industries can be cyclical and\ninherently impacted by changes in market demand. Actual results may differ materially in the\nweeks and months ahead.\nFor the fourth fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, we expect revenues in the range of\n$22 - 25 million with adjusted EBITDA nominally positive. Although the near-term outlook for\nrevenue and earnings remains challenging, we remain confident that the future prospects\nare strong for both our consumables and equipment serving advanced mobility and\nadvanced packaging applications. We took actions during the first and second quarters of\nfiscal 2024, which will reduce Amtech's structural costs by approximately $7 million annually\nand better align product pricing with value. These steps should significantly improve results\nand enhance profitability through market cycles.\nA portion of Amtech's results is denominated in Renminbis, a Chinese currency. The outlook\nprovided in this press release is based on an assumed exchange rate between the United\nStates Dollar and the Renminbi. Changes in the value of the Renminbi in relation to the\nUnited States Dollar could cause actual results to differ from expectations.\nConference Call\nAmtech Systems will host a conference call at 5:00 pm ET on Wednesday, August 7, 2024\nto discuss our fiscal third quarter financial results. The call will be available to interested\nparties by dialing 1-800-717-1738. For international callers, please dial +1-646-307-1865.

Exhibits 36\nSIGNATURES 37\n2\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nOur discussion and analysis in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (\"Quarterly Report\"), our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the\n“2023 Form 10-K”), our other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), our press releases and in public statements of our officers and\ncorporate spokespersons contain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our or our officers’\ncurrent expectations or forecasts of future events. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions of management. We have\ntried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “may,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,”\n“predict,” “potential,” “project,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “likely,” “future,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “observe,” and “strategy” or the negative thereof or variations\nthereon or similar terminology relating to the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Any expectations based on these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and\nuncertainties and other important factors. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include, among others, future economic\nconditions, including changes in the markets in which we operate; changes in demand for our services and products; our revenue and operating performance; difficulties in\nsuccessfully executing our growth initiatives; difficulties in executing on our strategic initiatives with respect to our material and substrate business segment; the effects of\ncompetition in the markets in which we operate, including the adverse impact of competitive product announcements or new entrants into our markets and transfers of resources\nby competitors into our markets; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; pricing and gross profit pressures; control of costs and expenses; risks associated with new\ntechnologies and the impact on our business; legislative, regulatory, and competitive developments in markets in which we operate; possible future claims, litigation or\nenforcement actions and the results of any such claim, litigation proceeding, or enforcement action; the impact of any future pandemic or other business interruptions on our\nbusiness operations, financial results and financial position; risks of future cybersecurity incidents; adverse developments affecting financial institutions, including bank\nfailures; failure to comply with financial and other covenants and other requirements under our credit agreement and forbearance agreement with UMB Bank, as well as the\nability to extend, if necessary the forbearance period or obtain a waiver of the applicable defaults; and other circumstances and risks identified in this Quarterly Report or\nreferenced from time to time in our filings with the SEC. The occurrence of the events described, and the achievement of expected results, depend on many events, some or all of\nwhich are not predictable or within our control. These and many other factors could affect Amtech’s future operating results and financial condition and could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from expectations based on forward-looking statements made in this document or elsewhere by Amtech or on its behalf.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based on our or our officers’ current beliefs, expectations and\nassumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because\nforward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the\nforward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will in fact transpire or prove to be accurate. You should not place undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they were made.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise\nafter the date of this Quarterly Report. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly\nqualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequently filed Form\n10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports and our other filings with the SEC. Also note that we provide a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate\nassumptions relevant to our business under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2023 Form 10-K. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995. You should understand it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Amtech,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Amtech Systems, Inc., an Arizona corporation, together with its\nsubsidiaries.\n3\nPART I.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024 AND 2023\n(UNAUDITED)\n1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations and Basis of Presentation – Amtech is a leading, global manufacturer of capital equipment, including thermal processing and wafer polishing and\nrelated consumables used in fabricating semiconductor devices, such as silicon carbide (\"SiC\") and silicon power devices, analog and discrete devices, electronic assemblies,\nand light-emitting diodes (\"LEDs\"). We sell these products to semiconductor device and module manufacturers worldwide, particularly in Asia, North America and Europe.\nWe serve niche markets in industries that are experiencing technological advances, and which historically have been highly cyclical. Therefore, our future profitability and\ngrowth depend on our ability to develop or acquire and market profitable new products and on our ability to adapt to cyclical trends.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”), and consequently do not include all disclosures normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary, all of which\nare of a normal and recurring nature, to present fairly our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Certain information and note disclosures normally included\nin financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2023,\nhas been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete\nfinancial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and\nnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nOur fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to our fiscal years ending or\nended September 30, and the associated quarters, months, and periods of those fiscal years.\nThe consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.\nPrinciples of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates – The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nReclassifications – Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statement footnotes to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications,\nwhich include the breakout of contract liability activity, had no effect on the previously reported consolidated financial statements for any period.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses – Accounts receivable are recorded at the sales price of products sold to customers on trade credit terms. We\nestablish a valuation allowance to reflect our best estimate of expected losses inherent in our accounts receivable balance. The allowance is based on our evaluation of the\naging of the receivables, historical write-offs, the current economic environment and communications with the customer. We write off individual accounts against the\nallowance when we no longer believe that it is probable that we will collect the receivable because we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial\nobligations.\n9\nIntangible Assets – Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are capitalized and subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.\nWe regularly perform reviews to determine if facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the useful lives of our intangible assets are shorter than originally estimated\nor the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. When indicators exist, recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset\ngroup to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the asset group is determined not to be recoverable, the Company\nperforms an analysis of the fair value of the individual long-lived assets and will recognize an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such\nlong-lived assets. Additional information on impairment testing of intangible assets can be found in Notes 1 and 9 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recorded an impairment of definite lived intangible assets in our Material and Substrate segment. See Note 7 for a description of\nthe facts and circumstances leading to the intangible asset impairment.\nGoodwill – Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for impairment annually or when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is\nless than its carrying amount. If it is concluded that there is impairment, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds\nthe reporting unit’s fair value (although the loss would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit). Additional information on impairment testing\nof goodwill can be found in Notes 1 and 10 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recorded an impairment of goodwill in our Material and Substrate segment. See Note 7 for a description of the facts and\ncircumstances leading to goodwill impairment.\nContract Liabilities – Contract liabilities are reflected in current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as all performance obligations are expected to be\nsatisfied within the next 12 months. Contract liabilities relate to payments invoiced or received in advance of completion of performance obligations under a contract.\nContract liabilities are recognized as revenue upon the fulfillment of performance obligations. Contract liabilities consist of customer deposits and deferred revenue as of\nJune 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nThe following is a summary of activity for contract liabilities, in thousands:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 9,015 $ 9,661 $ 8,018 $ 7,231\nAcquired deposits — — — 2,077\nNew deposits 1,484 593 5,031 2,794\nDeferred revenue (12) (125) (18) (125)\nRefunds of deposits — — — (467)\nRevenue recognized (1,196) (2,323) (3,740) (3,736)\nAdjustment — 1 — 33\nEnding balance $ 9,291 $ 7,807 $ 9,291 $ 7,807\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had approximately $28.1 million of remaining performance obligations, which included recognized contract liabilities as well as amounts to be\ninvoiced and recognized in future periods. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately $51.8 million of remaining performance obligations. The orders included in our\nremaining performance obligations are expected to ship within the next twelve months.\nWarranty – A limited warranty is provided free of charge, generally for periods of 12 to 36 months to all purchasers of our new products and systems. Accruals are\nrecorded for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. While our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and we believe that the\namounts accrued for warranty expenditures are sufficient for all systems sold through June 30, 2024, we cannot guarantee that we will\n10\ncontinue to experience a similar level of predictability regarding warranty costs. In addition, technological changes or previously unknown defects in raw materials or\ncomponents may result in more extensive and frequent warranty service than anticipated, which could result in an increase in our warranty expense.\nThe following is a summary of activity in accrued warranty expense, in thousands:\nNine Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 965 $ 871\nAdditions for warranties issued during the period 203 411\nCosts incurred during the period (19) 35\nChanges in estimate for pre-existing warranties (400) (284)\nEnding balance $ 749 $ 1,033\nShipping Expense – Shipping and handling fees associated with outbound freight are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nShipping expense was $0.5 million and $0.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.6 million and $2.0 million for the nine months\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk – Our customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductor substrates and devices and electronic assemblies. Financial instruments that\npotentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. Credit risk is managed by performing credit\nevaluations of the customers’ financial condition, by requiring significant deposits where appropriate, and by actively monitoring collections. Letters of credit are required\nof certain customers depending on the size of the order, type of customer or its creditworthiness, and country of domicile.\nAs of June 30, 2024, one Semiconductor segment customer represented 18% of accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2023, two Semiconductor segment customers\neach represented 17% of accounts receivable.\nWe maintain our cash and cash equivalents in multiple financial institutions. Balances in the United States, which account for approximately 70% and 56% of total cash\nbalances as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, are primarily invested in financial institutions insured by the FDIC as well as a money market account.\nThe remainder of our cash is maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit in China, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Malaysia. We maintain cash in bank\naccounts in amounts which at times may exceed federally insured limits. At June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Amtech’s balances exceeded insured limits by\napproximately $7.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively. We have not experienced any losses on such accounts.\nRefer to Note 12 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding major customers, foreign sales and revenue in other countries subject to\nfluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – We group our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into three levels, based on the markets in\nwhich the assets and liabilities are traded, and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:\nLevel 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted market price for identical instruments traded in active markets.\nLevel 2 – Valuation is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are\nnot active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.\nLevel 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include use of\ndiscounted cash flow models and similar techniques.\n11\nIt is our policy to use observable inputs whenever reasonably practicable to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When\navailable, we use quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, the fair value measurement is based on models that use primarily market-\nbased parameters including interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates. In certain cases, where market rate assumptions are not available, we are required\nto make judgments about assumptions market participants would use to estimate the fair value of a financial instrument. Changes in the underlying assumptions used,\nincluding discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect current or future valuations.\n(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:13)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) – Included in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are money market funds and time deposit accounts. Cash\nequivalents are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n(cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:13)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:13)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:3) – The recorded amounts of these financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate their fair value because\nof the short maturities of these instruments.\n(cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:15) – The carrying value of debt under our amended Loan Agreement is based on a floating per annum rate of interest equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted daily, plus a\nmargin. At June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Company's total debt was $4.0 million, which approximates fair value. The fair value for the amended Loan Agreement\nwas estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and is therefore\nclassified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which enhances the\ntransparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. Adjustments to the annual disclosure of income taxes include: a tabular rate reconciliation comprised of\neight specific categories. Incomes taxes paid, disaggregated between significant federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. Eliminating requirements to disclose the nature and\nestimate of reasonably possible changes to unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months or that an estimated range cannot be made. Adds a requirement to disclose\nincome (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated between\ndomestic and foreign. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The\namendments in ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. This ASU is not expected to have a material effect on our\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which\nimproves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for public business\nentities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim reporting periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the\nimpact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nThere were no other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective as of June 30, 2024 that had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\n12\n2. Long-Term Debt\nOur finance lease liabilities and long-term debt consists of the following, in thousands:\nJune 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nRevolving credit facility $ — $ —\nTerm loan 3,981 10,573\nFinance leases 260 114\nTotal 4,241 10,687\nLess: current portion of finance lease liabilities\nand long-term debt (4,064) (2,265)\nFinance Lease Liabilities and Long-Term Debt $ 177 $ 8,422\nInterest expense on finance lease liabilities and long-term debt was $0.1 and $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and $0.5 million and $0.3\nmillion for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:25) (cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:25) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:28) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:15)\nOn January 17, 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) among Amtech, its U.S. based wholly owned subsidiaries Bruce Technologies,\nInc., BTU International, Inc., Intersurface Dynamics, Incorporated, P.R. Hoffman Machine Products, Inc., and Entrepix, Inc. (collectively the “Borrowers”), and UMB Bank,\nN.A., national banking association (the “Lender”). The Loan Agreement provides for (i) a term loan (the “Term Loan”) in the amount of $12.0 million maturing January 17,\n2028, and (ii) a revolving loan facility (the “Revolver”) with an availability of $8.0 million maturing January 17, 2024. The recorded amount of the Term Loan has an interest\nrate of 6.38%. The Revolver has a floating per annum rate of interest equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted daily. Under the Loan Agreement, we are required to pay a non-\nutilization fee equal to 0.125% of any unused portion of the Revolver in excess of any letter of credit obligations.\nThe Term Loan and Revolver are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Borrowers’ assets (other than certain customary excluded assets) and the Loan\nAgreement contains customary events of default, representations and warranties, and covenants that restrict the Borrowers’ ability to, among other things, incur additional\nindebtedness, other than permitted indebtedness, enter into mergers or acquisitions, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, or pay dividends, subject to customary exceptions.\nThe Loan Agreement additionally contains financial covenants such that, as of the end of each of their fiscal quarters, beginning March 31, 2023, the Borrowers must\nmaintain (i) a ratio of consolidated debt owed to Lender to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Loan Agreement) for such fiscal quarter, of not greater than 1.50 to 1.00,\nthrough December 31, 2024, based on a building four quarters (as described in the Loan Agreement), and then 1.00 to 1.00 each fiscal quarter thereafter, (ii) a ratio of (a) the\ntotal for such fiscal quarter of EBITDAR (as defined in the Loan Agreement) minus the sum of all income taxes paid in cash plus cash dividends/distributions plus\nmaintenance Capital Expenditures (as defined in the Loan Agreement) plus management fees paid in cash, to (b) the sum for such fiscal quarter of (1) Interest Charges (as\ndefined in the Loan Agreement) plus (2) required payments of principal on Debt (as defined in the Loan Agreement) (including the Term Loan, but excluding the Revolver)\nplus (3) operating lease/rent expense of not less than 1.30 to 1.00 based on a building four quarters (as described in the Loan Agreement), and (iii) a consolidated working\ncapital of current assets (excluding related party receivables and prepaid expenses) minus current liabilities of at least $35.0 million.\nAt September 30, 2023, we were not in compliance with the Debt to EBITDA and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined below) financial covenants under our Loan\nAgreement. On December 5, 2023, we entered into a Forbearance & Modification Agreement (the “Forbearance Agreement”) with UMB Bank related to such non-\ncompliance, pursuant to which UMB Bank agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies available to it as a result of such defaults.\n13\nWe will be operating under the terms of such Forbearance Agreement through January 17, 2025 (the “Forbearance Period”).\nThe Forbearance Agreement also amends the Loan Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the availability under the revolving line of credit from $8.0 million to $14.0\nmillion (the \"Revolver\"), and (ii) reduce the term loan commitment from $12.0 million to $4.4 million (the “Term Loan”). The Revolver maturity date was extended one year\nto January 17, 2025 and the Term Loan maturity date was extended one year to January 17, 2029. Both the Revolver and the Term Loan have a floating per annum rate of\ninterest equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted daily, plus the Applicable Margin (as such terms are defined in the Loan Agreement). We are required to pay a non-utilization fee\nequal to 0.125% of any unused portion of the Revolver in excess of any letter of credit obligations. As of September 30, 2023, no amounts were borrowed against the\nRevolver and there were no letters of credit outstanding. As of the effective date of the Forbearance Agreement, $10.0 million was drawn under the Loan Agreement, which\nincluded $4.4 million under the Term Loan and $5.6 million under the Revolver. As of June 30, 2024, $4.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan, no amounts were\nborrowed against the Revolver, and there was an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of $0.3 million.\nFuture borrowings, if any, under the Loan Agreement are subject to, among other things, having sufficient unencumbered Eligible Accounts, Eligible Foreign Accounts and\nEligible Inventory (as such terms are defined in the Loan Agreement) to meet the borrowing base requirements included in the amended Loan Agreement.\nUnder the amended Loan Agreement, the Company is required to comply with the following financial covenants:\n•Maintaining, on a consolidated basis, a minimum EBITDA (as defined in the Loan Agreement) through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, measured on a\nquarterly basis (the “Minimum EBITDA Covenant”). The Minimum EBITDA Covenant amount increases each quarter during such period. At June 30, 2024, we were\nin compliance with the Minimum EBITDA Covenant for such period (not less than EBITDA of $800,000 for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024), with actual\npositive EBITDA of $3.2 million for such period. The Minimum EBITDA Covenant replaced the Senior Debt to EBITDA covenant set forth in the original Loan\nAgreement.\n•As of the end of each of the Company’s fiscal years, commencing for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, the Company must maintain a ratio of (a) the total for\nsuch fiscal year of EBITDAR (as defined in the Loan Agreement) minus the sum of all income taxes paid in cash plus cash dividends/distributions plus maintenance\nCapital Expenditures (as defined in the Loan Agreement) plus management fees paid in cash, to (b) the sum for such fiscal quarter of (1) Interest Charges (as defined in\nthe Loan Agreement) plus (2) required payments of principal on Debt (as defined in the Loan Agreement) (including the Term Loan, but excluding the Revolver) plus\n(3) operating lease/rent expense, of not less than 1.30 to 1.00 based on a trailing four (4) quarter basis (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Covenant”). Prior to entering\ninto the Forbearance Agreement, this covenant was measured as of the end of each of the Company’s fiscal quarters, beginning March 31, 2023.\n•As of the end of each of the Company’s fiscal quarters, commencing March 31, 2023, the Company must maintain a consolidated working capital of current assets\n(excluding related party receivables and prepaid expenses) minus current liabilities of at least $35.0 million. This financial covenant remained unchanged in the\nForbearance Agreement.\nIf the Lender does not extend the Forbearance Period or otherwise grant a waiver in the future for the covenant defaults described above, an event of default under the Loan\nAgreement would exist. To the extent the Lender so elects, the outstanding indebtedness under the Loan Agreement could be accelerated following the expiration of any\napplicable cure periods, causing such debt to be immediately due and payable. In addition, should the Company default in its obligation to comply with any of the covenants\ndescribed immediately above during the Forbearance Period, an event of default would then exist, and, absent a further forbearance agreement or waiver granted by the\nLender, the Lender would have the right to accelerate the indebtedness following the expiration of any applicable cure periods, causing such debt to be immediately due and\npayable. Both events would also result in the termination of all commitments to extend further credit under the Loan Agreement. There is no guarantee we will have sufficient\nliquidity to repay our outstanding debt under the Loan Agreement in full if such debt were accelerated. As of June 30, 2024, we had $13.2\n14\nmillion in cash and cash equivalents, and $4.0 million in debt under the Loan Agreement. If we are unable to pay such debt as it comes due, or obtain waivers for such\npayments, our Lender could foreclose on the assets securing such debt. These events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. As of June 30, 2024, all outstanding debt under the Loan Agreement was classified as current as a result of the Lender’s ability, in its sole discretion, to call the\namounts due thereunder at the end of the Forbearance Period.\n(cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:13)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3)\nOur finance lease obligations totaled $0.3 million and $0.1 million as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe current and long-term portions of our finance leases are included in the current and long-term portions of finance lease liabilities and long-term debt in the table above\nand in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Entrepix’s CMP technology portfolio\nand wafer cleaning equipment will complement our existing substrate polishing and wet process chemical offerings. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement\nand Plan of Merger dated January 17, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), Emerald Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), merged with\nand into Entrepix (the “Merger”), resulting in Entrepix surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Acquisition” or “Transaction”).\nOn the Closing Date, in connection with the Merger Agreement and in contemplation of the Transaction, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with UMB\nBank, N.A., under which the Lender provided the Company with (i) a $12.0 million term loan maturing January 17, 2028, and (ii) an $8.0 million revolving loan facility\nmaturing January 17, 2024 (see Note 2).

Any\ndifferences in accounting policies were adjusted to reflect the accounting policies of the Company in the unaudited pro forma financial information presented.\n4. Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is\ncomputed similarly to basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially\ndilutive common shares had been issued. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options. In the case of a net loss,\ndiluted earnings per share is calculated in the same manner as basic EPS.\nFor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, options for 1,054,466 and 775,233 weighted average shares, respectively, were excluded from the diluted EPS\ncalculations because they were anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, options for 332,000 and 306,000 weighted average shares, respectively, were\nexcluded from the diluted EPS calculations because they were anti-dilutive. These shares could become dilutive in the future.\nA reconciliation of the components of the basic and diluted EPS calculations follows, in thousands, except per share amounts:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) $ 438 $ (1,027) $ (7,950) $ (567)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares used to compute basic EPS 14,209 14,058 14,198 14,031\nDilutive potential common shares due to stock\noptions (1) 5 — — —\nDilutive potential common shares due to RSUs (1) 40 — — —\nWeighted-average shares used to compute diluted EPS 14,254 14,058 14,198 14,031\nIncome (loss) per share:\nNet income (loss) per basic share $ 0.03 $ (0.07) $ (0.56) $ (0.04)\nNet income (loss) per diluted share $ 0.03 $ (0.07) $ (0.56) $ (0.04)\n(1)The number of common stock equivalents is calculated using the treasury method and the average market price during the period.\n17\n5.

The aggregate amortization\nexpense during the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $0.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nDuring each fiscal year, we periodically assess whether any indicators of impairment existed related to our intangible assets. At the end of December 2023, we identified a\ntriggering event. As a result of the decline in our stock price as of December 31, 2023, our book value materially exceeded our market value. As discussed in the Goodwill\nsection below, this resulted in a triggering event for impairment of goodwill. The results of the goodwill impairment test indicated that the book value of our Material and\nSubstrate reporting unit was in excess of the fair value, and, thus, was impaired. Prior to recognizing any impairment of goodwill, we tested the related long-lived assets for\nimpairment in our Material and Substrate segment. We tested each identified asset group within our Material and Substrate segment by first performing a recoverability test,\ncomparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of each asset group to its carrying value. This test indicated that the undiscounted cash\nflows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of certain asset groups. We then compared the carrying value of the individual long-lived assets within those asset\ngroups against their fair value in order to determine if impairment existed. Determining the fair value of those asset groups involves the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions, including projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends, and estimated discount rates\nbased on the asset group's weighted average return on assets, as derived from various methods. The fair value of the intangible assets were estimated using various valuation\nmethodologies, including the multi-period excess earnings method, the relief from royalty method and the distributor method. These fair value measurements fall under Level\n3 of the fair value hierarchy. As a result, we recorded a total impairment\n20\ncharge for intangible assets in our Materials and Substrate segment of $1.3 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. This impairment charge relates to developed\ntechnology, trade name, customer relationships and non-competition agreements at Entrepix.\n(cid:0). (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)/ (cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:13)(cid:0)(cid:13)\nThe Company evaluates goodwill at the reporting unit level, which, for the Company, is at the level of the reportable segments, Semiconductor and Material and Substrate.\nThe changes in carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the reporting units for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 is as follows, in thousands:\nMaterial and\nSemiconductor Substrate Total Goodwill\nGoodwill $ 5,905 $ 21,726 $ 27,631\nAccumulated impairment losses — — —\nBalance at September 30, 2023 5,905 21,726 27,631\nGoodwill acquired — — —\nImpairment of goodwill — (6,370) (6,370)\nBalance at June 30, 2024 $ 5,905 $ 15,356 $ 21,261\nGoodwill $ 5,905 $ 21,726 $ 27,631\nAccumulated impairment losses — (6,370) (6,370)\nBalance at June 30, 2024 $ 5,905 $ 15,356 $ 21,261\nDuring each fiscal year, we periodically assess whether any indicators of impairment exist which would require us to perform an interim impairment review. At the end of\nDecember 2023, we identified a triggering event. As a result of the decline in our stock price as of December 31, 2023, our book value materially exceeded our market value.\nThis triggering event indicated we should test goodwill for impairment. The results of the goodwill impairment test indicated that the book value of our Material and Substrate\nreporting unit was in excess of the fair value, and, thus, was impaired. There was no impairment of goodwill identified for our Semiconductor reporting unit. As of the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, there was no new impairment of goodwill for either the Material and Substrate reporting unit or the Semiconductor reporting unit.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income\napproach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income approach is based on a discounted future cash flow analysis that uses certain\nassumptions including: projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends; expected future investments\nand working capital requirements to sustain and grow the business; and estimated discount rates based on the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital as derived by\nthe Capital Asset Pricing Model and other methods, which includes observable market inputs and other data from identified comparable companies. The same estimates are\nalso used internally for our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and\noutcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data, and we also perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the\nestimated fair value of all of our reporting units. The market approach is based on the application of appropriate market-derived multiples selected from (i) comparable\npublicly-traded companies and/or (ii) the implied transaction multiples derived from identified merger and acquisition activity in the market. Multiples are then selected based\non a comparison of the reviewed data to that of the reporting unit and applied to relevant historical and forecasted financial parameters such as levels of revenues, EBITDA,\nEBIT or other metrics. The calculation of fair value falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nIf the future performance of these reporting units fall short of our expectations, if there are significant changes in operations due to changes in market conditions or if our stock\nprice continues to decline, we could be required to recognize additional material impairment charges in future periods.\n21\n8. Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was (10.2%) and 82.8% for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2024\ndiffers from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to goodwill and intangible impairment losses for which no tax benefit can be recognized. The effective tax rate\nfor the nine months ended June 30, 2023 differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the release of a portion of our valuation allowance in connection with\na deferred tax liability related to the Entrepix acquisition resulting in recognition of previously recorded deferred tax assets. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and\n2023, we recorded income tax expense of $0.5 million and an income tax expense of $0.2 million, respectively. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we\nrecorded an income tax expense of $0.7 million and income tax benefit of $2.7 million, respectively. The quarterly income tax provision is calculated using an estimated\nannual effective tax rate, based upon expected annual income, permanent items, statutory rates and planned tax strategies in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nHowever, losses in certain jurisdictions and discrete items are excluded from the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate.\n9. Equity and Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense was $0.5 million and $0.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.2 million and $0.5 million in\nthe nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe following table summarizes our stock option activity during the nine months ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nAverage\nOptions Exercise Price\nOutstanding at beginning of period 672,924 $ 8.76\nGranted 557,500 5.66\nExercised (5,000) 5.67\nForfeited (109,075) 9.53\nOutstanding at end of period 1,116,349 $ 7.15\nExercisable at end of period 392,684 $ 8.32\nWeighted average fair value of options granted during the period $ 2.44\nThe fair value of options was estimated at the applicable grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:\nNine Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nRisk free interest rate 4% 4%\nExpected term 5 years 5 years\nDividend rate —% —%\nVolatility 60% 56%\nThe following table summarizes our RSU activity during the nine months ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nNumber Fair Value\nNonvested at beginning of year 75,977 $ 9.15\nGranted 24,897 4.82\nReleased (20,421) 9.55\nForfeited — —\nNonvested at end of period 80,453 $ 7.71\n22\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Obligations – As of June 30, 2024, we had unrecorded purchase obligations in the amount of $11.3 million. These purchase obligations consist of outstanding\npurchase orders for goods and services. While the amount represents purchase agreements, the actual amounts to be paid may be less in the event that any agreements are\nrenegotiated, canceled or terminated.\nLegal Proceedings and Other Claims – From time to time, we are a party to claims and actions for matters arising out of our business operations. We regularly evaluate the\nstatus of the legal proceedings and other claims in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss, or an additional\nloss, may have been incurred and determine if accruals are appropriate. If accruals are not appropriate, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an\nestimate of possible loss or range of possible loss can be made for disclosure. Although the outcome of claims and litigation is inherently unpredictable, we believe that we\nhave adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity could be\nmaterially and adversely affected in any period by the resolution of a claim or legal proceeding. Legal expenses related to defense, negotiations, settlements, rulings and\nadvice of outside legal counsel are expensed as incurred.\nEmployment Contracts – We have employment contracts and change in control agreements with, and severance plans covering, certain officers and management employees\nunder which severance payments would become payable in the event of specified terminations without cause or terminations under certain circumstances after a change in\ncontrol. If severance payments under the current employment contracts or severance plans were to become payable, the severance payments would generally range from six to\ntwelve months of salary.\n11. Reportable Segments\nAmtech has two operating segments that are structured around the types of product offerings provided to our customers.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our “Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements” in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Quarterly Report”) and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Item 8. Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\nOverview\nWe are a leading, global manufacturer of capital equipment, including thermal processing and wafer polishing and related consumables used in fabricating semiconductor\ndevices, such as silicon carbide (\"SiC\") and silicon power devices, analog and discrete devices, electronic assemblies, and light-emitting diodes (\"LEDs\"). We sell these\nproducts to semiconductor device and module manufacturers worldwide, particularly in Asia, North America and Europe.\nWe operate in two reportable segments, based primarily on the industries they serve: (i) Semiconductor and (ii) Material and Substrate. In our Semiconductor segment, we\nsupply thermal processing equipment, including solder reflow ovens, horizontal diffusion furnaces, and custom high-temp belt furnaces for use by semiconductor, electronics\nand electro/mechanical assembly manufacturers. Our semiconductor customers are primarily manufacturers of integrated circuits and optoelectronic sensors and discrete (\"O-S-\nD\") components used in analog, power and radio frequency (\"RF\"). In our Material and Substrate segment, we produce wafer cleaning equipment as well as substrate\nconsumables and chemicals for lapping (fine abrading) and polishing of materials, such as silicon wafers for semiconductor products, sapphire wafers for LED applications, and\ncompound substrates, like SiC wafers, for power device applications.\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical, but not seasonal, and historically has experienced fluctuations. Our revenue is impacted by these broad industry trends.\nStrategy\nWe continue to focus on our plans to profitably grow our business and have developed a strategic growth plan and a capital allocation plan that we believe will support our\ngrowth objectives. Our Power Semiconductor strategic growth plan leverages our experience, products and capabilities in pursuit of growth, profitability and sustainability. Our\ncore focus areas are:\n•(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:20) - Advanced Mobility encompasses both the development and adoption of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, including both electric vehicle\n(EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), as well as advanced automotive electronics including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), infotainment and\ntelematics. Our products intersect these markets in multiple ways: consumables and wafer cleaning systems for the SiC substrates used in power modules; thermal\nprocessing systems for cooling modules and DBC substrate manufacturing; and reflow ovens for ADAS, infotainment and telematics component assemblies.\n•(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:20) - There is a global trend of creating supply chain resiliency by expanding and/or relocating operations outside of mainland China. We believe\nthese factory openings will create demand for new equipment and services in growing regions like Mexico and Southeast Asia.\n•(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:2) - With Artificial Intelligence (AI), our reflow oven systems are the favored choice for Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test Services\n(OSATS) providers who perform advanced packaging of the AI chips.\nWe anticipate future investments will be required to meet the expected demand from our growing served markets to achieve our revenue growth targets, including investments\nin research and development as well as capital expenditures, which also includes further investments in talent and management information systems. In June 2022, we\ncompleted the sale of the real property where our manufacturing facility in Massachusetts is located. In connection with this sale, we entered into a two-year leaseback of the\nfacility. This sale-leaseback transaction resulted in a net cash inflow of\n25\napproximately $14.9 million, after repayment of the existing mortgage and settlement of related sale expenses. In September 2023, we signed a lease for a new location with\nless square footage and completed the move to this location in June 2024. As we expand our use of contract manufacturers, we will continue to look for ways to reduce our real\nestate footprint. In March 2024, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters real property in Arizona. The sale resulted in a net cash inflow of approximately $2.5\nmillion, after settlement of related sale expenses. Following the closing of this transaction, we entered into a lease agreement for a new office for our corporate headquarters,\nwhich commenced during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. In addition, we are evaluating business continuity and resiliency within our operations, our management\ninformation systems, and our needs to allow for greater efficiencies and to ensure our infrastructure can support our future growth plans. As a capital equipment manufacturer,\nwe will continue to invest in our business to drive future growth.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues, net 100% 100% 100% 100%\nCost of sales 64% 64% 65% 62%\nIntangible asset impairment —% —% 1% —%\nGross margin 36% 36% 34% 38%\nSelling, general and administrative 31% 34% 32% 36%\nResearch, development and engineering 2% 6% 4% 6%\nGain on sale of fixed assets —% —% (3)% —%\nGoodwill impairment —% —% 8% —%\nIntangible asset impairment —% —% 1% —%\nSeverance expense —% —% 1% —%\nOperating income (loss) 3% (4)% (9)% (4)%\nInterest income —% —% —% —%\nInterest expense —% (1)% —% —%\nForeign currency gain (loss) —% 2% —% —%\nOther —% —% —% —%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 3% (3)% (9)% (4)%\nIncome tax provision (benefit) 1% —% 1% (3)%\nNet income (loss) 2% (3)% (10)% (1)%\n(cid:0)(cid:28) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:2)\nNet revenue consists of revenue recognized upon shipment or delivery of equipment. Spare parts sales are recognized upon shipment and service revenue is recognized upon\ncompletion of the service activity, which is generally ratable over the term of the service contract. Since the majority of our revenue is generated from large system sales,\nrevenue, gross profit and operating income can be significantly impacted by the timing of system shipments.\nOur net revenue by reportable segment was as follows, dollars in thousands:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\nSegment 2024 2023 Change % Change 2024 2023 Change % Change\nSemiconductor 18,038 $ 19,841 $ (1,803) (9)% 53,006 $ 58,775 $ (5,769) (10)%\nMaterial and Substrate 8,711 10,899 (2,188) (20)% 24,096 26,833 (2,737) (10)%\nTotal net revenue $ 26,749 $ 30,740 $ (3,991) (13)% $ 77,102 $ 85,608 $ (8,506) (10)%\nTotal net revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $26.7 million and $30.7 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately $4.0 million or 13%. Our\nSemiconductor results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 reflect decreases in shipments of our high-temperature furnaces, surface-mount technology (“SMT”) and packaging\nequipment, partially offset by increases in shipments of our horizontal diffusion furnaces. We continue to\n26\nexperience softness in shipments of our advanced packaging and SMT equipment, primarily related to a slowdown in global demand in the consumer markets. Material and\nSubstrate revenue decreased due primarily to lower sales of our wafer cleaning equipment.\nTotal net revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $77.1 million and $85.6 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately $8.5 million or 10%.\nRevenue from the Semiconductor segment decreased $5.8 million compared to the prior year period. This change is primarily attributable to fewer shipments of our horizontal\ndiffusion furnaces, SMT and packaging equipment partially offset by an increase in shipments of our belt furnaces. Revenue from our Material and Substrate segment\ndecreased $2.7 million due primarily to decreased shipments of wafer cleaning equipment.\n(cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:31) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:27)\nNew orders booked by reportable segment were as follows, dollars in thousands:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\nSegment 2024 2023 Change % Change 2024 2023 Change % Change\nSemiconductor $ 10,801 $ 18,293 $ (7,492) (41)% $ 39,990 $ 63,983 $ (23,993) (37)%\nMaterial and Substrate 8,013 7,924 89 1% 21,700 21,729 (29) —%\nTotal new orders $ $ $ $ $ $\n18,814 26,217 (7,403) (28)% 61,690 85,712 (24,022) (28)%\nOur backlog by reportable segment was as follows, dollars in thousands:\nJune 30,\nSegment 2024 2023 Change % Change\nSemiconductor $ 27,673 $ 53,219 $ (25,546) (48)%\nMaterial and Substrate 4,164 8,096 (3,932) (49)%\nTotal backlog $ 31,837 $ 61,315 $ (29,478) (48)%\nAs of June 30, 2024, two of our Semiconductor segment customers individually accounted for 28% and 10% of our backlog. Additionally, one customer of both our\nSemiconductor and Material and Substrate segments accounted for 16% of our backlog. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our backlog as of June 30, 2024.\nThe orders included in our backlog are generally credit approved customer purchase orders believed to be firm and are generally expected to ship within the next twelve\nmonths. Our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor is backlog any assurance that we will realize profit from\ncompleting these orders. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, a horizontal diffusion customer notified us of the cancelation of a furnace project for $4.5 million, which\nwe believe is due to the slow-down in electric vehicle adoption. Also during this period, the improvement in lead times across all of our product lines favorably contributed to\nthe decline in our backlog.\n(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)!

Cost of goods sold consists of purchased material, labor and overhead to manufacture equipment and\nspare parts and the cost of service and support to customers for installation, warranty and paid service calls. Gross margin is gross profit as a percent of net revenue. Our gross\nprofit and gross margin by business segment were as follows, dollars in thousands:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30,\nGross Gross Gross Gross\nSegment 2024 Margin 2023 Margin Change 2024 Margin 2023 Margin Change\nSemiconductor $ 6,313 35% $ 6,707 34% $ (394) $ 17,513 33% $ 21,810 37% $ (4,297)\nMaterial and Substrate 3,445 40% 4,278 39% (833) 8,915 37% 10,948 41% (2,033)\nTotal gross profit $ 9,758 36% $ 10,985 36% $ (1,227) $ 26,428 34% $ 32,758 38% $ (6,330)\n27\nOur gross margins can be affected by capacity utilization, material costs, and the type and volume of machines and consumables sold each quarter. Gross profit for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $9.8 million (36% of net revenue) and $11.0 million (36% of net revenue), respectively, a decrease of $1.2 million. Gross margin on\nproducts from our Semiconductor segment increased compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, due to changes in our product mix. Gross margin on products from our\nMaterial and Substrate segment increased compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to a more favorable product mix, with increased consumable sales\npartially offset by lower equipment sales. We are experiencing increased material costs across all our segments. In response to such increased costs, we continually review our\npricing plans and supplier agreements, with the objective of passing on these increased costs to our customers where possible; however, we continue to experience pricing\npressure from our customers. Additionally, there is the potential that our backlog could be negatively affected due to rising material costs. We are also exploring and\nimplementing partnerships with contract manufacturers, who can leverage their buying power on a larger scale. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we began making targeted\nlabor reductions as a result of the shift to contract manufacturing and the continuing slowdown in the broader semiconductor industry.\nGross profit for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $26.4 million (34% of net revenue) and $32.8 million (38% of net revenue), respectively, a decrease of $6.3\nmillion. Gross margin on products from our Semiconductor segment decreased compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to changes in our product mix\nand increased material costs. Gross margin on products from our Material and Substrate segment decreased compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to\nan impairment charge of $0.8 million for intangible assets and decreased utilization at our facilities.\n(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)\"(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:2)\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consists of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors, facility costs, sales commissions, shipping costs,\npromotional marketing expenses, legal and accounting expenses and bad debt expense.\nSG&A expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were $8.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively. SG&A decreased compared to the prior year quarter due\nprimarily to decreased shipping expense on lower sales and decreased labor and employee-related expenses primarily as a result of fixed cost reductions across all of our\ndivisions.\nSG&A expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were $25.0 million and $30.9 million, respectively. SG&A decreased compared to the prior year period\nprimarily due to decreased shipping expense on lower sales, decreased labor and employee-related expenses primarily as a result of fixed cost reductions across all of our\ndivisions, and lower consulting fees. Additionally, the nine months ended June 30, 2023 included $3.2 million of transaction expenses related to the acquisition of Entrepix.\n(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)\"(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)# (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:27)\nResearch, development and engineering (“RD&E”) expenses consist of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and\nprocesses as well as materials and supplies used in producing prototypes. RD&E expenses may vary from period to period depending on the engineering projects in process.\nExpenses related to engineers working on strategic projects or sustaining engineering projects are recorded in RD&E. However, from time to time we add functionality to our\nproducts or develop new products during engineering and manufacturing to fulfill specifications in a customer’s order, in which case the cost of development, along with other\ncosts of the order, are charged to cost of goods sold. Occasionally, we receive reimbursements through governmental research and development grants which are netted against\nthese expenses when certain conditions have been met.\n28\nRD&E expense, net of grants earned, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were $0.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and $3.2 million and $4.7 million in\nthe nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in RD&E is due to the timing of purchases related to specific strategic-development projects at our\nSemiconductor and Material and Substrate segments. Additionally, the prior year period included expenditures related to new product development projects at our Material and\nSubstrate segment, which were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2023. Grants earned are immaterial in all periods presented.\n(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)% (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:10)\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized impairment of our goodwill of $6.4 million at our Material and Substrate segment as a result of a triggering event\nidentified at the end of the first quarter.\n(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:10)\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized impairment of our definite lived intangible assets of $1.3 million at our Material and Substrate segment. As stated\nabove, $0.8 million of this impairment was recorded in cost of goods sold, and the remainder was recorded within operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement\nof Operations.\n(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)& (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:2)\n(cid:0)(cid:12)\nSeverance expense was $40,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2024\ndiffers from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to goodwill and intangible impairment losses for which no tax benefit can be recognized. The effective tax rate for\nthe nine months ended June 30, 2023 differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the release of a portion of our valuation allowance in connection with a\ndeferred tax liability related to the Entrepix acquisition resulting in recognition of previously recorded deferred tax assets. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nwe recorded income tax expense of $0.5 million and an income tax expense of $0.2 million, respectively. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded\nincome tax expense of $0.7 million and income tax benefit of $2.7 million, respectively. The quarterly income tax provision is calculated using an estimated annual effective tax\nrate, based upon expected annual income, permanent items, statutory rates and planned tax strategies in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. However, losses in certain\njurisdictions and discrete items are excluded from the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate.\nOur future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as the amount of income (loss) in each tax jurisdiction, tax regulations governing each region, non-tax\ndeductible expenses incurred as a percent of pre-tax income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.\n29\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)( (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)%\nThe following table sets forth for the periods presented certain consolidated cash flow information, in thousands:\nNine Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 8,963 $ (7,150)\nNet cash used in investing activities (2,610) (36,854)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (6,640) 11,590\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 337 (155)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 50 (32,569)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 13,133 46,874\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 13,183 $ 14,305\nA summary of our cash position as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, is as follows, in thousands, except working capital ratio:\nJune 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 13,183 $ 13,133\nRestricted cash $ — $ —\nWorking capital $ 42,993 $ 51,471\nCurrent ratio (current assets to current liabilities) 2.6:1 2.7:1\nThe increase in cash and cash equivalents from September 30, 2023 of $0.1 million was primarily due to increased customer down payments, collections from customers and\nproceeds from the sale of our real property in Arizona, partially offset by payments on debt and fixed asset purchases. We maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in\nRenminbis, a Chinese currency, at our operations in China; therefore, changes in the exchange rates have an impact on our cash balances. The decrease in working capital of\n$8.5 million (calculated in the table above) was primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventories.\nDuring periods of weakening demand, we typically generate cash from operating activities, which we may decide to reinvest in our business via strategic projects. Conversely,\nwe are more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of\nequity securities, which includes common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings, the incurrence of long-term debt and customer deposits. Additionally, in\nJanuary 2023, we entered into the Loan Agreement with UMB Bank, which included a revolving line of credit with availability up to $8.0 million. On December 5, 2023, we\namended this credit facility to, among other things, (i) increase the availability under the revolving line of credit from $8.0 million to $14.0 million (the “Revolver”), (ii) reduce\nthe term loan commitment from $12.0 million to $4.4 million (the “Term Loan”), (iii) extend the maturity date of the Revolver one year to January 17, 2025 and the Term Loan\none year to January 17, 2029. See the Forbearance Agreement disclosure under the heading Financing Facilities. Future borrowings, if any, under the Loan Agreement are\nsubject to, among other things, having sufficient unencumbered Eligible Accounts, Eligible Foreign Accounts and Eligible Inventory (as such terms are defined in the Loan\nAgreement) to meet the borrowing base requirements included in the amended credit facility. There can be no assurance that we can raise such additional capital resources when\nneeded or on satisfactory terms. We believe that our principal sources of liquidity discussed above are sufficient to support operations for at least the next twelve months.\n(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)( (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)% (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17)\nCash provided by our operating activities was $9.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $7.2 million used in operating activities for the nine months\nended June 30, 2023. During the 2024 period, our accounts receivable collections exceeded new accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections. We\nreduced our inventory levels as we prepared to move our Semiconductor facility in Massachusetts and refined our supply chain systems and practices to more closely align with\ncustomer buying patterns. Additionally, we received more down payments from customers for future shipments during the quarter. During the nine months ended June 30,\n2023, we\n30\nused cash to increase our inventory balances in preparation for shipments scheduled over the next four quarters and to pay the related accounts payable.\n(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)( (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)% (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17)\nCash used in investing activities was $2.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $36.9 million used in investing activities in the nine months ended June\n30, 2023. The fiscal 2024 amount consists of $5.3 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to our new locations in South Carolina and Massachusetts, partially offset by\n$2.7 million of proceeds from the sale of our real property in Arizona. The fiscal 2023 amount consists primarily of cash paid for the acquisition of Entrepix. We expect capital\nexpenditures to decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 as we complete our relocation projects.\n(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:23) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)( (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)% (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:11) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)( (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17)\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was $6.6 million, primarily comprised of payments on long-term debt. For the nine months ended\nJune 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $11.6 million, comprised of $12.0 million in borrowings on debt facility and $0.5 million of proceeds received from the\nexercise of stock options partially offset by $0.9 million in payments on long-term debt.\n(cid:0)( (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)( (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:17)\nOur debt balance as of June 30, 2024 was $4.2 million, including our finance lease obligations. As previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\n30, 2023, at such date we were not in compliance with the Debt to EBITDA and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenants under our Loan Agreement. On December 5,\n2023, we entered into a Forbearance & Modification Agreement (the “Forbearance Agreement”) with UMB Bank related to such non-compliance, pursuant to which UMB Bank\nagreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies available to it as a result of such defaults. We will be operating under the terms of such Forbearance Agreement\nthrough January 17, 2025 (the “Forbearance Period”).\nThe Forbearance Agreement also amends the Loan Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the availability under the revolving line of credit from $8.0 million to $14.0\nmillion (the \"Revolver\"), and (ii) reduce the term loan commitment from $12.0 million to $4.4 million (the “Term Loan”). The Revolver maturity date was extended one year to\nJanuary 17, 2025 and the Term Loan maturity date was extended one year to January 17, 2029. Both the Revolver and the Term Loan have a floating per annum rate of interest\nequal to the Prime Rate, adjusted daily, plus the Applicable Margin (as such terms are defined in the Loan Agreement). We are required to pay a non-utilization fee equal to\n0.125% of any unused portion of the Revolver in excess of any letter of credit obligations. As of September 30, 2023, no amounts were borrowed against the Revolver and there\nwere no letters of credit outstanding. As of the effective date of the Forbearance Agreement, $10.0 million will be drawn under the Loan Agreement, which includes $4.4\nmillion under the Term Loan and $5.6 million under the Revolver. As of June 30, 2024, $4.0 million was outstanding on the Term Loan, no amounts were borrowed against the\nRevolver, and there was an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of $0.3 million.\nFuture borrowings, if any, under the Loan Agreement are subject to, among other things, having sufficient unencumbered Eligible Accounts, Eligible Foreign Accounts and\nEligible Inventory (as such terms are defined in the Loan Agreement) to meet the borrowing base requirements included in the amended Loan Agreement.\nUnder the Loan Agreement, as amended by the Forbearance Agreement, the Company is required to comply with the following financial covenants:\n•Maintaining, on a consolidated basis, a minimum EBITDA (as defined in the Loan Agreement) through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, measured on a\nquarterly basis (the “Minimum EBITDA Covenant”). The Minimum EBITDA Covenant amount increases each quarter during such period. At June 30, 2024, we were in\ncompliance with the Minimum EBITDA Covenant for such period (not less than EBITDA of $800,000 for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024), with actual\npositive EBITDA\n31\nof $3.2 million for such period. The Minimum EBITDA Covenant replaced the Senior Debt to EBITDA covenant set forth in the original Loan Agreement.\n•As of the end of each of the Company’s fiscal years, commencing for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, the Company must maintain a ratio of (a) the total for\nsuch fiscal year of EBITDAR (as defined in the Loan Agreement) minus the sum of all income taxes paid in cash plus cash dividends/distributions plus maintenance\nCapital Expenditures (as defined in the Loan Agreement) plus management fees paid in cash, to (b) the sum for such fiscal quarter of (1) Interest Charges (as defined in\nthe Loan Agreement) plus (2) required payments of principal on Debt (as defined in the Loan Agreement) (including the Term Loan, but excluding the Revolver) plus (3)\noperating lease/rent expense, of not less than 1.30 to 1.00 based on a trailing four (4) quarter basis (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Covenant”). Prior to entering into\nthe Forbearance Agreement, this covenant was measured as of the end of each of the Company’s fiscal quarters, beginning March 31, 2023.\n•As of the end of each of the Company’s fiscal quarters, commencing March 31, 2023, the Company must maintain a consolidated working capital of current assets\n(excluding related party receivables and prepaid expenses) minus current liabilities of at least $35.0 million. This financial covenant is unchanged in the Forbearance\nAgreement.\nIf the Lender does not extend the Forbearance Period or otherwise grant a waiver in the future for the covenant defaults described above, an event of default under the Loan\nAgreement would exist. To the extent the Lender so elects, the outstanding indebtedness under the Loan Agreement could be accelerated following the expiration of any\napplicable cure periods, causing such debt to be immediately due and payable. In addition, should the Company default in its obligation to comply with any of the covenants\ndescribed immediately above during the Forbearance Period, an event of default would then exist, and, absent a further forbearance agreement or waiver granted by the Lender,\nthe Lender would have the right to accelerate the indebtedness following the expiration of any applicable cure periods, causing such debt to be immediately due and payable.\nBoth events would also result in the termination of all commitments to extend further credit under the Loan Agreement. There is no guarantee we will have sufficient liquidity to\nrepay our outstanding debt under the Loan Agreement in full if such debt were accelerated. As of June 30, 2024, we had $13.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $4.0\nmillion in debt under the Loan Agreement. If we are unable to pay such debt as it comes due, or obtain waivers for such payments, our Lender could foreclose on the assets\nsecuring such debt. These events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. As of June 30, 2024, all outstanding debt under\nthe Loan Agreement was classified as current as a result of the Lender’s ability, in its sole discretion, to call the amounts due thereunder at the end of the Forbearance Period.\nThe Loan Agreement also includes quarterly and annual reporting requirements and other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for facilities of\nthis type. At June 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC that have or are reasonably likely to\nhave a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital\nresources that are material to investors.\nContractual Obligations\nUnrecorded purchase obligations were $11.3 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $24.3 million as of September 30, 2023, a decrease of $13.0 million.\nOther than as described in Note 2, there were no material changes to the contractual obligations included in \"Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” of our 2023 Form 10-K.\n32\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\"Part I, Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Quarterly Report discusses our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes, inventory valuation, business combination,\ngoodwill, and long-lived asset impairment. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, expectations regarding the future and on various other factors that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nA critical accounting estimate is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations, and requires management’s most difficult,\nsubjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These uncertainties are discussed in\nPart I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K. We believe our critical accounting estimates relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the critical accounting estimates discussed in the section entitled “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n– Critical Accounting Policies” in our 2023 Form 10-K represent the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nThere have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see “Part I, Item 1. Financial Information” under “Impact of Recently Issued Accounting\nPronouncements.”\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations\nand, therefore, are not required to provide the information requested by this Item.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\n(cid:0)(cid:1)\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),\nthat are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npossible controls and procedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of\nJune 30, 2024. Based upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were\nnot effective at a reasonable assurance level, due to the material weaknesses previously identified and disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K and listed below. A material weakness\nis a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in\n33\ninternal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than as discussed below, there were no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended June 30, 2024, that have materially\naffected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe closed on the acquisition of Entrepix during the year ended September 30, 2023. We have evaluated the existing controls and procedures of Entrepix and integrated our\ninternal control structure over this acquired business.\n(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:10)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)!

As a result of our evaluation, our management, under the oversight of\nour Audit Committee, has redesigned existing controls and implemented new controls to remediate the control deficiencies giving rise to the material weakness.\nWith respect to the material weakness related to general information technology controls, our management, under the oversight of our Audit Committee, has evaluated the\ncurrent processes and has redesigned existing controls and implemented new controls to remediate the control deficiencies giving rise to this material weakness. Remediation\nefforts include, but are not limited to:\n•Assessing and formalizing the design of certain information technology policies.\n•Developing monitoring controls and protocols that will allow us to timely assess the design and operating effectiveness of the new controls.\n•Strengthening of user access reviews and enhanced procedures surrounding program change management for systems supporting substantially all of the Company’s\ninternal control processes.\n•Assessing segregation of duties within the Company’s business processes.\nThe material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing,\nthat these controls are operating effectively. We anticipate that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed during fiscal year 2024. We are committed to\ncontinuing to improve our internal control processes, and, as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional\nmeasures to address control deficiencies, or we may modify certain of our remediation measures.\n34\nPART II.
