third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, <https://investor.nvidia.com>. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures** To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\n**NVIDIA CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME**  \n(In millions,

The blueprint is a reference workflow that includes NVIDIA acceleration libraries, physics-AI frameworks and interactive physically based rendering to achieve 1,200x faster simulations and real-time visualization.\n\n“We built Omniverse so that everything can have a digital twin,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Omniverse Blueprints are reference pipelines that connect NVIDIA Omniverse with AI technologies, enabling leading CAE software developers to build groundbreaking digital twin workflows that will transform industrial digitalization, from design and manufacturing to operations, for the world’s largest industries.”\n\nOne of the first applications of the blueprint is computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, a critical step to virtually explore, test and refine the designs of cars, airplanes, ships and many other products. Traditional engineering workflows — from physics simulation to visualization and design optimization — can take weeks or even months to complete.\n\nIn an industry first, NVIDIA and [_Luminary Cloud_](https://www.luminarycloud.com/resources/luminary-cloud-uses-nvidia-omniverse-blueprint-for-real-time-computer-aided-engineering-digital-twins) are demonstrating at SC24 a [_virtual wind tunnel_](https://youtu.be/RIxrN7yedyQ) that allows users to simulate and visualize fluid dynamics at real-time, interactive speeds, even when changing the vehicle model inside the tunnel.\n\n**Unifying Three Pillars of NVIDIA Technology for Developers** Building a real-time physics digital twin requires two fundamental capabilities: real-time physics solver performance and real-time visualization of large-scale datasets.\n\nThe Omniverse Blueprint achieves these by bringing together [_NVIDIA CUDA-X™_](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/cuda-x/?srsltid=AfmBOoq7zX7NUN6__AakYfQ5sKN-n70nvoKPrSG5srexotjFzcZ72xEo) libraries to accelerate the solvers, the [_NVIDIA Modulus_](https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus) physics-AI framework to train and deploy models to generate flow fields, and [_NVIDIA Omniverse application programming interfaces_](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) for 3D data interoperability and real-time RTX-enabled visualization.\n\nDevelopers can integrate the blueprint as individual elements or in its entirety into their existing tools.\n\n**Ecosystem Uses NVIDIA Blueprint to Advance Simulations** [_Ansys_](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/industrial-sector/ansys/?srsltid=AfmBOorCpb5vgCv8Ytob4NTQvXIZ8mmJruB0op2G8LVQTQ5HXt3Qg77A) is the first to adopt the Omniverse Blueprint, applying it to Ansys Fluent fluid simulation software to enable accelerated CFD simulation.\n\nAnsys ran Fluent at the Texas Advanced Computing Center on 320 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips. A 2.5-billion-cell automotive simulation was completed in just over six hours, which would have taken nearly a month running on 2,048 x86 CPU cores, significantly enhancing the feasibility of overnight high-fidelity CFD analyses and establishing a new industry benchmark.\n\n“By integrating NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint with Ansys software, we’re enabling our customers to tackle increasingly complex and detailed simulations more quickly and accurately,” said Ajei Gopal, president and CEO of Ansys. “Our collaboration is pushing the boundaries of engineering and design across multiple industries.”\n\nLuminary Cloud is also adopting the blueprint. The company’s new simulation AI model, built on [_NVIDIA Modulus_](https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus), learned the relationships between airflow fields and car geometry based on training data generated from its GPU-accelerated CFD solver.

chief financial officer, is available at <https://investor.nvidia.com>.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information** NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, <https://investor.nvidia.com>. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures** To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and

These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems\nand services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is\ncritical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\nOn June 7, 2024, we completed a 10-for-1 forward stock split. All share and per share amounts\npresented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\nRevenue\nRevenue was a record $35.1 billion, up 94% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially.\nData Center revenue was a record, up 112% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially. The strong\nyear-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our Hopper computing platform for\ntraining and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI\napplications. Cloud service providers represented approximately 50% of our Data Center revenue, and\nthe remainder was represented by consumer internet and enterprise companies. Strong year-on-year\ngrowth was driven by all customer types from both compute and networking. Demand for the\nHopper architecture is strong and our H200 offering grew significantly in the quarter. Data Center\ncompute revenue was $27.6 billion, up 132% from a year ago and up 22% sequentially. Networking\nrevenue was $3.1 billion, up 20% from a year ago driven by Ethernet for AI, which includes Spectrum-\nX end-to-end ethernet platform. Areas of sequential revenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet\nswitches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down 15%,\nnetworking demand is strong and growing.\nWe completed a successful mask change for Blackwell, our next Data Center architecture, that\nimproved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026. We will be shipping both Hopper and\nBlackwell systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and beyond. Both Hopper and Blackwell\nsystems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply\nfor several quarters in fiscal 2026.\nGaming revenue was up 15% from a year ago and up 14% sequentially. These increases were driven\nby sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and game console SoCs.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 17% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. These\nincreases were driven by the continued ramp of RTX GPU workstations based on our Ada\narchitecture.\nAutomotive revenue was a record, up 72% from a year ago and up 30% sequentially. These increases\nwere driven by our self-driving platforms.\nGross Margin\nGAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased from a year ago due to a higher mix of Data Center\nrevenue. Sequentially, gross margins decreased primarily driven by a mix shift from H100 systems to\nmore complex and higher cost systems within Data Center.\nExpenses\nGAAP operating expenses were up 44% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially, and non-GAAP\noperating expenses were up 50% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially. These GAAP expense\nincreases were driven by higher compensation and benefits expenses due to employee growth and\ncompensation increases. Sequentially, non-GAAP expenses increased due to compute, infrastructure,\nand engineering development costs for new product introductions.\nOther Income & Expense and Income Tax\nGAAP other income and expense (OI&E) includes interest income, interest expense, and gains or\nlosses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities. Non-GAAP OI&E excludes\nthe gains or losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities.\nInterest income was $472 million, up from a year ago and up sequentially, primarily reflecting higher\ncash balances. Net gains from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities were $37\nmillion, reflecting fair value adjustments and sales of investments.\nGAAP effective tax rate was 13.5%, an increase from a year ago reflecting the lower effect of various\ntax benefits relative to the increase in pre-tax income. Fiscal 2024 additionally included a discrete\nbenefit due to an IRS audit resolution. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15.5%.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $38.5 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago\nand $34.8 billion a quarter ago. The increases reflect higher revenue partially offset by higher stock\nrepurchases.\nAccounts receivable was $17.7 billion with 46 days sales outstanding (DSO). Accounts receivable\nreflects $1.7 billion of customer payments received prior to next quarter’s invoice due dates.\nInventory was $7.7 billion with 78 days sales of inventory (DSI). Inventory increased from $6.7 billion,\nand DSI decreased from 81 days sequentially. Purchase commitments and obligations for inventory\nand manufacturing capacity were $28.9 billion, including new capacity commitments and\ncomponents. Supply and capacity prepayments were $5.2 billion.\nOther non-inventory purchase obligations were $13.2 billion, including $11.3 billion of multi-year\ncloud service agreements. We expect cloud service agreements to be used to support our research\nand development efforts and our DGX Cloud offerings.\nCash flow from operating activities was $17.6 billion, up from $7.3 billion a year ago and up from\n$14.5 billion a quarter ago. The sequential increase reflects higher revenue and the timing of\npayments of cash taxes throughout the year. The year-on-year increase reflects higher revenue.\nWe utilized cash of $11.2 billion towards shareholder returns, including $11.0 billion in share\nrepurchases and $245 million in cash dividends.\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal 2025 Outlook\nOutlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is as follows:\n• Revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n• GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.0% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or\nminus 50 basis points.\n• GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and\n$3.4 billion, respectively.\n• GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of\napproximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and\npublicly-held equity securities.\n• GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any\ndiscrete items.\n___________________________\nFor further information, contact:\nStewart Stecker Mylene Mangalindan\nInvestor Relations Corporate Communications\nNVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA Corporation\nsstecker@nvidia.com mmangalindan@nvidia.com\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with\nGAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance.\nThese non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP\noperating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP\nnet income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. In order for\nNVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the\ncompany has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations\nadjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense,\nacquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and\npublicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the\nassociated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash\nprovided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and\nintangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA\nbelieves the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall\nunderstanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s\nnon-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the\ncompany’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP\nmeasures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nCertain statements in this CFO Commentary including, but not limited to, statements as to: our computing platforms\nproviding tremendous acceleration for applications and delivering unique value; markets where our expertise is critical;\nnetworking demand; expected Blackwell production shipments and production ramp; expected shipments of Hopper and\nBlackwell systems; supply constraints for Hopper and Blackwell systems; demand for Blackwell; cloud service agreements\nbeing used to support our research and development efforts and our DGX Cloud offerings; and our financial outlook and\nexpected tax rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and\nuncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange\nCommission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 28, 2024 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by\nU.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of\nresults of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results\nexpected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024.\nIn May 2024, we announced a ten-for-one stock split, or the Stock Split, of our issued common stock, which was effected through the filing of an amendment to\nthe Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or the Amendment, with the Secretary of the State of Delaware. In June 2024, the Company filed the\nAmendment to effect the Stock Split and proportionately increased the number of shares of the Company’s authorized common stock from 8.0 billion to\n80.0 billion. Shareholders of record at the close of market on June 6, 2024 received nine additional shares of common stock, distributed after the close of market\non June 7, 2024. All share, equity award and per share amounts presented herein have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025 and 2024 are both 52-week years. The third quarters of fiscal\nyears 2025 and 2024 were both 13-week quarters.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including\nthose related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,\ninvestigation and settlement costs, litigation, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These\nestimates are based on historical facts and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of significant expenses in\noperating segments. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2025 annual report. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of rate\nreconciliation and income taxes paid. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We are currently evaluating the impact of this\nstandard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,\nincluding, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory,\n9\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nemployee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each income statement expense caption, as applicable. We expect to\nadopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 2 - Leases\nOur lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters' campus and domestic and international offices and data centers, with lease\nperiods expiring between fiscal years 2025 and 2036.\nFuture minimum lease obligations under our non-cancelable lease agreements as of October 27, 2024 were as follows:\nOperating Lease\nObligations\n(In millions)\nFiscal Year:\n2025 (excluding the first nine months of fiscal year 2025) $ 78\n2026 336\n2027 340\n2028 320\n2029 288\n2030 and thereafter 667\nTotal 2,029\nLess imputed interest 266\nPresent value of net future minimum lease payments 1,763\nLess short-term operating lease liabilities 273\nLong-term operating lease liabilities $ 1,490\nBetween the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2027, we expect to commence leases with future obligations of $4.2 billion primarily of data center\nand office operating leases, with lease terms of 1.5 to 15.5 years.\nOperating lease expenses were $92 million and $69 million for the third quarter, and $258 million and $195 million for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2025\nand 2024, respectively. Short-term and variable lease expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were not significant.\nOther information related to leases was as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nOct 27, 2024 Oct 29, 2023\n(In millions)\nSupplemental cash flows information\nOperating cash flow used for operating leases $ 227 $ 200\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 679 $ 439\nAs of October 27, 2024, our operating leases have a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.5 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.15%. As of\nJanuary 28, 2024, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.1 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.76%.\nNote 3 - Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporate\nfinancial performance targets, market-based PSUs that are performance stock units based on our performance compared to market performance, and the\nemployee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized into inventory and subsequently\nrecognized to cost of revenue, as follows:\n10\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nOct 27, 2024 Oct 29, 2023 Oct 27, 2024 Oct 29, 2023\n(In millions)\nCost of revenue $ 50 $ 38 $ 125 $ 96\nResearch and development 910 701 2,469 1,826\nSales, general and administrative 292 240 822 633\nTotal $ 1,252 $ 979 $ 3,416 $ 2,555\nEquity Award Activity\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\nRSUs, PSUs, and Market-based PSUs Outstanding\nWeighted Average Grant-Date Fair\nNumber of Shares Value Per Share\n(In millions, except per share data)\nBalance as of Jan 28, 2024 367 $ 24.59\nGranted 84 $ 84.70\nVested (135) $ 23.03\nCanceled and forfeited (8) $ 31.23\nBalance as of Oct 27, 2024 308 $ 41.45\nAs of October 27, 2024, aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense was $12.4 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted\naverage period of 2.3 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and one year for ESPP.\nNote 4 - Net Income Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nOct 27, 2024 Oct 29, 2023 Oct 27, 2024 Oct 29, 2023\n(In millions, except per share data)\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 19,309 $ 9,243 $ 50,789 $ 17,475\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average shares 24,533 24,680 24,577 24,700\nDilutive impact of outstanding equity awards 241 260 260 240\nDiluted weighted average shares 24,774 24,940 24,837 24,940\nNet income per share:\nBasic (1) $ 0.79 $ 0.37 $ 2.07 $ 0.71\nDiluted (2) $ 0.78 $ 0.37 $ 2.04 $ 0.70\nAnti-dilutive equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share 9 10 72 140\n(1) Net income divided by basic weighted average shares.\n(2) Net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.\nDiluted net income per share was computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using\nthe treasury stock method.\nNote 5 - Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $3.0 billion and $1.3 billion for the third quarter, and $8.0 billion and $2.2 billion for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income\n11\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\ntax was 13.5% and 12.2% for the third quarter, and 13.6% and 11.3% for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction relative to the increase\nin income before income tax and a discrete benefit in fiscal year 2024 due to an IRS audit resolution.\nEffective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the\nforeign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation, the U.S. federal research tax credit, and income earned in jurisdictions that are subject\nto taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate.\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the\nnear term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could\nvary based on our assessment of all available information.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position\nwill be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal,\nstate and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise\nresolved with the respective tax authorities.

The amended\ncomplaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,\nand SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand\nbetween May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including\nattorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to\ndismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\njudgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel\naffirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in\ndismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision to\nreverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit for a\nstay of the mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s resolution of the matter.\nOn December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June\n17, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari. Briefing concluded on October 25, 2024 and the Supreme\nCourt heard oral arguments on November 13, 2024.\n19\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed\nJanuary 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re\nNVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once\nthe appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The stay remains in place. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf\nof us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections\n14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact\nof cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s\ncorporate governance and internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et\nal. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the\nIn Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the\nCompany for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b),\nand 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of\ncryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock\nand unspecified corporate governance measures.\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No.\n2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and\ninsider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on\nGPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of\nunspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation\naction.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of October 27, 2024, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities,\nwhile possible, are not probable. Further, except as described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this\ntime. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable\noutcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\nNote 13 - Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Return Program\nWe repurchased 92 million and 83 million shares of our common stock for $11.1 billion and $3.7 billion during the third quarter, and 254 million and 159 million\nshares of our common stock for $26.2 billion and $7 billion during the first nine months, of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the\ngaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and 3D\ninternet applications. Our two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply\nRevenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.\nDemand for the Hopper architecture is strong and our H200 offering grew significantly in the quarter. We completed a successful mask change for Blackwell, our\nnext Data Center architecture, that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025\nand will continue to ramp into fiscal year 2026. We will be shipping both Hopper and Blackwell systems in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Both\nHopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal year\n2026.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to\ngenerate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and\nscale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have\nalso entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase\nvolumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with\nvariations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to\nincreased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory\n24\nprovisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct Transitions and New Product Introductions\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\nnew products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.\nThe computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\nopportunities. We have introduced a new architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete a new computing architecture each year\nand we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may create volatility in our revenue. The increased\nfrequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact\nour ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\nfrequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.\nWhile we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\nability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\nGlobal Trade\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong\nKong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for\nshipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Our upcoming Blackwell systems, such\nas GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 will also be subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and\nto China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we\nunderstand that partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before\neach shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew\nsequentially in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export\ncontrols in October 2023. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but\nhave no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in\nthe USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the\nexport control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our\nbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the\nMiddle East. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or\nmanufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United\nStates, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export\ncontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative\n25\nmanufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of this potential impact.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical\ndevelopments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify,\nthese macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our\ninvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously\nmanage product availability and costs with our vendors.\nIsrael and Regional Conflicts\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 4,300\nemployees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our global\nsupply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. A substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up\nfor active military duty in Israel. Some employees in Israel have been on active military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may\ncause disruption to our product development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is\nfurther extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nThird Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 Summary\nThree Months Ended\nQuarter-over-Quarter Year-over-Year\nOct 27, 2024 Jul 28, 2024 Oct 29, 2023 Change Change\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nRevenue $ 35,082 $ 30,040 $ 18,120 17 % 94 %\nGross margin 74.6 % 75.1 % 74.0 % (0.5) pts 0.6 pts\nOperating expenses $ 4,287 $ 3,932 $ 2,983 9 % 44 %\nOperating income $ 21,869 $ 18,642 $ 10,417 17 % 110 %\nNet income $ 19,309 $ 16,599 $ 9,243 16 % 109 %\nNet income per diluted share $ 0.78 $ 0.67 $ 0.37 16 % 111 %\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate processors,\ninterconnects, software, algorithms, systems and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data\nCenter, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue was $35.1 billion, up 94% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially.\nData Center revenue was up 112% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our\nHopper computing platform for training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Cloud service\nproviders represented approximately 50% of our Data Center revenue, and the remainder was represented by consumer internet and enterprise companies.\nStrong year-on-year growth was driven by all customer types from both compute and networking. Demand for the Hopper architecture is strong and our H200\noffering grew significantly in the quarter. Data Center compute revenue was $27.6 billion, up 132% from a year ago and up 22% sequentially. Networking\nrevenue was $3.1 billion, up 20% from a year ago driven by Ethernet for AI, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet platform. Areas of sequential\nrevenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down 15%, networking\ndemand is strong and growing.\nGaming revenue was up 15% from a year ago and up 14% sequentially. These increases were driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and game\nconsole SoCs.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 17% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. These increases were driven by the continued ramp of RTX GPU\nworkstations based on our Ada architecture.\nAutomotive revenue was up 72% from a year ago and up 30% sequentially. These increases were driven by our self-driving platforms.\nGross margin increased from a year ago due to a higher mix of Data Center revenue. Sequentially, gross margin decreased primarily driven by a mix shift from\nH100 systems to more complex and higher cost systems within Data Center.\n26\nOperating expenses were up 44% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially, driven by higher compensation and benefits expenses due to employee growth and\ncompensation increases.\nFinancial Information by Business Segment and Geographic Data\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure regarding segment information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nRefer to Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024.

Revenue from Data Center computing grew 133% year-on-year and 195% compared to the first nine\nmonths of fiscal year 2024 driven by demand for our Hopper computing platform for training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation\nengines, and generative AI applications. Networking was up 20% year-on-year and 90% compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 driven by Ethernet\nfor AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet platform.\nGraphics revenue – The year over year increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025 was led by higher sales of our GeForce RTX 40\nSeries GPUs.\nReportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by growth in data center revenue. The year over year increase in Graphics segment operating income in the third\nquarter of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase of 52% in segment operating expense. The year over year\nincrease in Graphics segment operating income in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by growth in revenue.\nAll Other operating loss – The year over year increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025 was due to an increase in stock-based\ncompensation expense reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers, such as enterprises and\ngamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 58% and 65% of total revenue for the third quarter,\nand 55% and 62% of total revenue for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and\nsystem integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system\nintegrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud\nservice providers, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\nSales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment, are\npresented in the following table:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nOct 27, 2024 Oct 27, 2024\nCustomer A 12 % *\nCustomer B 12 % 11 %\nCustomer C 12 % 11 %\nCustomer D * 12 %\n* Less than 10% of total revenue\nThe customer references of A-D above may represent different customers than those reported in a previous period.\nFor the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and\ndistributors, including through Customer C, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\n28\nIndirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data\nand other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates.\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue.\nGross margins increased to 74.6% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to 74.0% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, due to a higher mix of\nData Center revenue. Gross margins increased to 75.8% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to 70.9% for the first nine months of fiscal year\n2024, primarily due to higher mix of Data Center revenue.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $865 million and $2.2 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year\n2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $106\nmillion and $305 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, respectively.

Our accounts receivable balance at the end of the first nine months of fiscal year 2025\nreflects the strong revenue growth, partially offset by $1.7 billion from customer payments received prior to the invoice due date.\nCash used in investing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by\nnet purchases of marketable securities, and purchase of land, property and equipment.\nCash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher\nshare repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of October 27, 2024,\nwe had $38.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at\nleast the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our\nliquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations\nand financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. Our corporate debt\nsecurities are publicly traded. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nExcept for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related\nforeign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S.\nas of October 27, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nPayment from customers, per our standard payment terms, is generally due shortly after delivery of products, availability of software licenses or commencement\nof services.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nWe paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $245 million and $589 million during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, respectively.\nOur cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the\ndividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nWe repurchased 92 million and 254 million shares of our common stock for $11.1 billion and $26.2 billion during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal\nyear 2025, respectively. On August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase authorization, without expiration.\nAs of October 27, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $46.4 billion of our common stock. Our share repurchase\nprogram aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue\nadditional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.\nFrom October 28, 2024 through November 15, 2024, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.7 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made\nafter December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost and was not material for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year\n2025.\n31\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of October 27, 2024, by year payable, are as follows:\nOct 27, 2024\n(In millions)\nDue in one year $ —\nDue in one to five years 2,250\nDue in five to ten years 2,750\nDue in greater than ten years 3,500\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs (38)\nNet long-term carrying amount $ 8,462\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 27, 2024, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion.\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\nUnrecognized tax benefits were $1.9 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $215 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of\nOctober 27, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the\nunderlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for further information.\nOther than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations\nfrom those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024\nfor a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our operating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Notes 2,\n11, and 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, respectively.\nClimate Change\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing\nrenewable energy or climate-related business trends.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThere has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nFinancial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. As of October 27, 2024, there have been no material changes to the financial\nmarket risks described as of January 28, 2024.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About\nMarket Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. As of October 27, 2024, there have been no material changes to the\nforeign exchange rate risks described as of January 28, 2024.\n32\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of October 27, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the\ninformation we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of\nour existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will\noccur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal\ncontrols, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits\nof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\n33\nPart II. Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nRefer to Part I, Item 1, Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal\nproceedings since January 28, 2024. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for\na prior discussion of our legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOther than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 28, 2024 and July\n28, 2024.\nPurchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 28, 2024 and July 28,\n2024, and below. Any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to\ndecline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations or reputation.\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately,\nhas led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component\nor capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as\nwe have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and\nexcess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-\nterm supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our\nlong-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the\nfinished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the\nsemiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future\nsupply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet\nour supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply\ncommitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for\nBlackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal year 2026.\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products,\nor otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\n• changes in product development cycles and time to market;\n• competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\n• changes in business and economic conditions;\n• sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\n• rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n• the availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;\n• new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n• new or unexpected end-use cases;\n• increase in demand for competitive products;\n• business decisions made by third parties;\n34\n• the demand for accelerated computing, AI-related cloud services, or large language models;\n• changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\n• the demand for our products; or\n• government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have\nalso entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase\nvolumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with\nvariations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to\nincreased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments\nexceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have\nexperienced in the past.\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\nnew products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.\nThe computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\nopportunities. We have introduced a new architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete a new computing architecture each year\nand we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating\nproduct transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in\nour revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate\ntransitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to\nexecute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increased frequency and complexity of\nnewly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other\ncosts or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for\nlow-yielding Blackwell material.\nWe incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products\nor adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be\nable to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product\ntransitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our\nsupply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Our indirect customers purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and\nother channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in\nresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability\nto accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production\nand we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. If our contract manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be\nable to increase supply to meet customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill\nour customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation\ncould be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any\none component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may\nnot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including\ndue to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may\nneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to\ncontinue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of\nour\n35\nhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may\ncontinue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total\nsupply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to\ngenerate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and\nscale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us\nto estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if\nwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to\nour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future\nimpact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to\nbe used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of\ncryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in\nthe method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0\nmerge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\naftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or\npreviously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and\nreseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our\nplatforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure by\ndevelopers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers\nor publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect\ncustomer demand.\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may\nadversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;\ntaxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls\nand cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;\nenvironmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such\nrequirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to\nmanufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws\nor the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions\nagainst us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations\nto which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further\nrestrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result\nof changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.\nOur position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,\nthe United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and\ncompetition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received\nrequests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs\nand other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies\ndeveloping foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and\n36\nregulators are considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models\nand generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act was formally adopted in June 2024 and will be implemented in phases between now and 2030. The State of\nCalifornia, among other jurisdictions, is considering similar legislation. Restrictions under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs\nand burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers,\nnegatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased\ntaxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which\ncould have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the\nregions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or\nother trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export\nlicense with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),\nand generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or\nsanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available\nunder the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which\nblocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to\nRussia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of\nenabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,\nmodels, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,\ntuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users\nworldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.\nAs geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export\ncontrol restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated\nproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and\napplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively\nimpact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and\ncould negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,\nwhich have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even\nthough competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial\nresults. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products\nto additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively\nimpact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and\ncustomers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China\nand for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our\nproducts, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to\nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting\nour business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.\nAdditional unilateral or multilateral\n37\ncontrols are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our\nroadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke\nresponses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in\nall markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China\nmarket and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such\ncommitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any\nof which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and\nsupercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,\nproduce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,\nDGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated\ncircuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are\nalso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in\nChina. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for\nshipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Our upcoming Blackwell systems, such\nas GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 will also be subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and\nto China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and\nHong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution\noperations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for\nwhich the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing\nrequirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a\nlicense or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved, it may impose burdensome conditions that\nwe or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards\nor an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to\ncustomers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions that are onerous, even\nfor small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have\ndisadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or\nmay be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nManagement of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive\nposition and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the\ngeographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we\nare unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to\nsignificant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose\nburdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors,\nas the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to\npursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time\nand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the\nevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets,\n38\nincluding the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale\nGPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such\nas requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or\nlocation, are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict\nadditional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets\noutside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater\nimpact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our\nproducts, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact\ndemand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-\nspeed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider\nrange of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are\noutside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other\nimpacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to\nserve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that\nour customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,\nexcessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe,\nLatin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the\ntime a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase\ninvestment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in\nwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming\nrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage\ncustomers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing\ncomponents made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing\ncertain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new\nstandards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the\nChinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard,\nthis may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results\nand financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that\nnegatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe repurchased 92 million and 254 million shares of our common stock for $11.1 billion and $26.2 billion during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal\nyear 2025, respectively.

This Award is granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the “Date of Grant”).\nCapitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan.\n1. Grant of the Award. The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for each Restricted\nStock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant,\nthe Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the “Account”) the number of Restricted Stock\nUnits subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with\nrespect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.\n2. Vesting.\n(a) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule provided in\nthe Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice.\n(b) Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in which case\nvesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan).\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to your\ndeath, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); provided, however, that: (i)\nsuch acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of\nyour estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if\napplicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under\napplicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of\nsuch acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement).\n(c) On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that\nwere not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the\nPlan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such\nRestricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous Service during only a period prior to\na vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata portion of the\nRestricted Stock Units on such date.\nEffective Date: September 16, 2024\n1.\n(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Grant Notice or this Agreement, and subject to applicable law, (i) in the event your regular\nlevel of time commitment in the performance of your services for the Company or any Affiliate is reduced after the Date of Grant, a\ncorresponding reduction shall be made (rounded down to the nearest whole share) in the number of shares of Common Stock subject to any\nportion of your Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date of such change in time commitment, and (ii) in the event you go\non an approved personal leave of absence pursuant to the Company’s Personal Leave of Absence Policy (the “PLOA Policy”) and the leave\nexceeds a certain duration, vesting of your Award shall be suspended during a portion of the leave and upon your return, the vesting schedule of\nyour Award shall be extended accordingly, as described in the PLOA Policy. In the event of a reduction described in (d)(i), you will have no right\nwith respect to any portion of your unvested Award and the number of shares of Common Stock that are reduced.\n3. Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock.\n(a) The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will be adjusted from time to time\nfor Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.\n(b) Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a result of a Capitalization Adjustment, if\nany, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable to the other\nshares covered by your Award.\n(c) No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3. The Board will round down, to the\nnearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares.\n4. Compliance with Law. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are registered under the\nSecurities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.\nYour Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal\nand local laws, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such\nlaws and regulations.\n5. Limitations on Transfer. Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition to any\nother limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise\ndispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been\nissued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares, provided that any\nsuch actions are in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board and valid\nunder applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company’s designated broker, pursuant to a form provided by such broker,\ndesignate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were\nentitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement.\n6. Date of Issuance.\n(a) The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to comply with Treasury Regulations\nSection 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to the extent applicable. The form of such issuance (e.g., a\nstock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) will be determined by the Company.\nEffective Date: September 16, 2024\n2.\n(b) Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement) and Section\n6(c) of this Agreement, in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the applicable vesting date (or\nas soon as administratively practicable thereafter), one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests (and for purposes of\nthis Agreement, such issuance date is referred to as the “Original Issuance Date”); provided, however, that the Original Issuance Date will in all\ncases occur no later than the Issuance Deadline. For purposes of this Agreement, the “Issuance Deadline” means the latest of the following, as\napplicable: (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the applicable vesting date occurs (that is, the last day of your taxable year in which\nthe applicable vesting date occurs); (ii) if permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the last day of\nthe period set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(A); or (iii) any date that is permitted without incurring adverse tax\nconsequences under Section 409A of the Code.\n(c) If (i) this Award is subject to any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) on the Original Issuance\nDate, (ii) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an “open window period” applicable to you, as determined by the Company in\naccordance with the Company’s then-effective policy on trading in Company securities, or (2) on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell\nshares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market (including but not limited to under a previously established\nCompany-approved 10b5-1 trading plan), and (iii) the Company elects, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (1) not to satisfy any withholding\nobligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares otherwise due, on\nthe Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, (2) not to permit you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer\npursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to a commitment under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan)\nand (3) not to permit you to cover any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) in cash, then the shares\nthat would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not be issued on such Original Issuance Date and will instead be issued\non the first business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market or\non such other date determined by the Company, but in no event later than the Issuance Deadline.\n7. Dividends. You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with respect to any cash\ndividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment. Following the date of vesting, in the event of\nany cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment, no cash, stock or other property\nrelated to such dividend or distribution will be issuable in respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units.\n8.

You further acknowledge that the\nCompany and/or the Service Recipient (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in\nconnection with any aspect of your Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant of\nthe Restricted Stock Units, the vesting and settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the delivery or sale of any shares of Common Stock and the\nissuance of any dividends, and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of your Award\nto reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. You acknowledge and agree that you will not make\nany claim against the Company, or any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or Affiliates (including the Service Recipient) for Tax-Related Items\narising from your Award. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company\nand/or the Service Recipient may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\n(b) In connection with the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactorily\nto the Company and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.

In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld\namount in cash from the Company or the Service Recipient (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you may\nseek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to the\napplicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Service Recipient. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country,\nincluding your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority’s administrative practices, not to exceed\nthe highest rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax-\nRelated Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the\nfull number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common\nStock is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.\n(d) Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you any shares of\nCommon Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award.\n(e) In the event any obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of shares of Common Stock or it is determined after the delivery\nof shares of Common Stock to you that the amount of the withholding obligation was greater than the amount withheld, if anything, you agree to\nindemnify and hold the Company and/or the Service Recipient harmless from any failure by the Company and/or the Service Recipient to\nwithhold the proper amount.\n11.
