(NASDAQ: ENVB) (“Enveric” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of novel neuroplastogen small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders, today announced the completion of preclinical pharmacokinetic (“PK”) studies in rat and dog further supporting the oral bioavailability and targeted non-hallucinogenic profile of EB-003.\n\nThe PK studies demonstrated oral bioavailability in rat and dog studies that was dose-proportional, as was also shown previously in a mouse model. No clinical signs, including those associated with hallucination, were observed in either study. For example, in dogs, ataxia and vocalization were not observed.\n\nAdditionally, significant brain penetration was demonstrated in the rat model with a brain/plasma ratio of about 5-6, which is significantly higher than was seen in the mouse model (~1.5). This increased brain/plasma ratio could translate to enhanced efficacy, lower doses, and less off-target side effects if these findings are confirmed in clinical trials.\n\n“Completion of these animal PK studies further supports our efforts to develop conveniently delivered, orally-available drugs with the potential to harness neuroplastic properties without inducing hallucinations,” said Joseph Tucker, Ph.D., CEO of Enveric. “The additional data gained in these animal studies enhances our understanding of the preclinical profile of this drug candidate and brings us a step closer to finalizing the data package for the EB-003 Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which we anticipate submitting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2025.”\n\n“Mental health disorders like depression and anxiety are on the rise, with approximately one billion people globally expected to experience a neuropsychiatric disorder at some time in their lives1. Despite the prevalence of these conditions, currently approved treatments fail to provide adequate relief for half of the patients who try them, resulting in widespread challenges to the psychiatric community2. The market opportunity for neuroplastogens is estimated to exceed $35 billion by 2030, with the potential to offer low side-effects, strong efficacy, and potential synergies with current drugs, which could help drive demand for new and innovative treatment options3.”\n\n  1.

Additionally, preclinical safety and pharmacology studies confirmed that EB-003 targets desired serotonergic receptors while minimizing potentially harmful, off-target interactions common to serotonin-like drug compounds. These are clear differentiators for EB-003, which we believe will add to its value potential.”\n\nDr. Tucker added: “Since the June FDA Advisory Committee hearing that raised numerous questions around the potential to approve MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder, Enveric helped lead the discussion for how neuroplastogens with no or limited hallucinogenic effects might safely progress through clinical trials and gain approval for these patients in need while avoiding the challenges and complexities inherent to running trials with hallucination-inducing compounds. We chose to focus Enveric’s AI-backed drug development platform on reducing and removing hallucinations for our various candidates to mitigate these challenges during clinical development and to reduce barriers to wide adoption by physicians post approval.”\n\nDr. Tucker continued: “In our opinion, drug technologies that minimize or eliminate the hallucinogenic effect in molecules targeting the 5-HT2A receptor have the potential to become the gold standard in one or more neuropsychiatric indications, given the advantages such compounds would offer, including the ability to conduct truly blinded placebo-controlled clinical trials and the potential to administer the therapy in an outpatient setting without psychotherapy support. Recognizing this, we are working to finalize the data package for the EB-003 Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which we anticipate submitting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2025.”\n\nDr. Tucker concluded: “In parallel with our EB-003 development efforts, Enveric continues to seek to identify opportunities to secure out-licensing agreements for our other proprietary drug candidates. On this front, we were pleased to enter into separate licensing agreements with Aries Science & Technology and MycoMedica Life Sciences, and we anticipate announcing additional agreements over the coming months. These agreements not only validate the Company’s platform but also generate non-dilutive revenue to support the development of EB-003 and further building stockholder value.”\n\n**THIRD QUARTER AND RECENT UPDATES**\n\n**Corporate, Product and Business Development Highlights:**\n\n  * Confirmed oral bioavailability and significant brain exposure in preclinical studies of EB-003, supporting expedited development with IND filing and first patient dosed expected in 2025 \n  * Announced positive results from preclinical safety and pharmacology studies of EB-003, confirming the drug’s selective activity with desired serotonergic neuroreceptors and ability to minimize potential adverse cardiovascular and CNS events \n  * Presented foundational research involving EB-003 at the 7th Neuropsychiatric Drug Summit and the European Behavioral Pharmacology Society Biennial Workshop \n  * Strengthened intellectual property estate for EVM301 portfolio and announced the issuance of five additional U.S. patents \n  * Executed licensing agreement with Aries Science & Technology to clinically develop and market Enveric’s patented product for radiation dermatitis \n  * Executed licensing agreement with MycoMedica Life Sciences to clinically develop and market Enveric’s EB-002 drug candidate \n\n\n\n**THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\nNet loss attributable to stockholders was $2.1 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, including $0.5 million in net non-cash expense, with a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.24, as compared to a net loss of $2.8 million, including $0.2 million in net non-cash income, with a basic and diluted loss per share of $1.30 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

MycoMedica will receive an exclusive, global license to the formulations, drugs, method of use, and medical devices developed by Enveric to utilize the compound. MycoMedica would assume responsibility for all future preclinical, clinical, and commercial development on a royalty-bearing basis for all human and animal pharmaceutical applications. As part of the license agreement, if certain conditions are met, Enveric is eligible to receive upfront, development, and sales milestones potentially totaling up to $62 million, plus tiered single digit royalties on all future sales. The license grants sublicensing rights and cash buyout options to MycoMedica.\n\nEnveric has established a strong foundation of intellectual property supporting the value potential for the EVM201 program, including EB-002, with numerous patents issued in the U.S. and applied for internationally.\n\n“Given Enveric’s strategic decision to prioritize EB-003, our novel, non-hallucinogenic neuroplastogen drug candidate, we have entered into a definitive license agreement with MycoMedica to out-license EB-002 with modest upfront payments that allow the EB-002 technology to move forward, followed by potentially transformational milestone and royalty payments. Doing so enables Enveric to fully allocate its operations and development resources to the advancement of EB-003, while creating excellent potential for realization of longer-term revenue from EB-002,” said Joseph Tucker, Ph.D., CEO of Enveric.\n\n“We are excited to enter into this licensing agreement with Enveric and continue the development of EB-002 as we seek to advance new treatment options for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders,” said Sanjay Dubé M.D., MycoMedica’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer.\n\nEnveric’s efforts are now focused on the development of EB-003, the Company’s novel, potentially first-in-class, neuroplastogen, with the intention to file an Investigational New Drug application in 2025.\n\n**About Enveric Biosciences**\n\nEnveric Biosciences (NASDAQ: ENVB) is a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of novel neuroplastogenic small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction disorders. Leveraging its unique discovery and development platform, Psybrary™, Enveric has created a robust intellectual property portfolio of new chemical entities for specific mental health indications.
