We needed to raise money ($80 million), to get approval from the SunPower board for our so-called stalking-horse chapter 11 plan in which our small company would acquire over 1,000 employees from solar icon SunPower Corporation that in effect was an IPO for the three divisions acquired from SunPower. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware approved our plan, and we began the integration.\n\n![Revenue Projection](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/69f8526f-2992-4a95-8d35-2c44e198d9e8/picture1-2-.png)\n\nThe first five-quarter plan (Q4’24-Q4’25) presented to investors in the $80 million funding presentation called for $100 million in revenue in Q4’24 for the combined company with a sustainable operating income loss of $1.0 million, followed in Q2’25 by its first profitable quarter ($0.4 million).\n\n**“NewCo” (Complete Solar Plus “Old SunPower” Plus its Blue Raven Solar Subsidiary)**\n\nThe combined team worked throughout October and early November to reorganize into a new start-up like organization designed to be lean enough to achieve breakeven with $100 million in revenue. That organization is shown below as deployed in order of size in Utah, Rest of US, Texas and the Philippines. Certain administrative functions were centralized to provide great savings in headcount, also shown below:\n\n![Org Chart](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/7f16f41b-cd7e-428a-bbd3-d29f935d74cc/picture2-5-.jpg)\n\n**Complete Solar Announces Preliminary Q3’24 Results**\n\nOur companies were not combined until October 1, 2024, so there are no GAAP and non-GAAP results to report for the combined business for Q3’24, but the following chart shows preliminary and unaudited Q3’24 results based on a simple summing of the separate results shown on November 6 to employees and investors.\n\nOperating Income  \n---  \nDivision| Charter| Revenue| Prior Report by Division  \nNew Homes| Sales to homebuilders| $53.2| N/A| ($11.9)  \nBlue Raven Solar| Sales direct to customer| $43.5| N/A| ($6.9)  \nDealer (+ CSLR)| Sales of jobs from dealers| $ 20.61| N/A| ($21.3)  \n$117.34| ($73.8)2| ($40.0)3  \n  \n _1. Contains $5.5M in revenue from the “old CSLR” and $15.1M in revenue from the old SunPower “Dealer” Division now combined as NewCo’s “Dealer” Division. 2. Contains write-offs due to the bankruptcy & acquisition. 3. High costs due to running the pre-layoff employment levels of both companies during the quarter. 4. High revenue due to accumulated backlog at SunPower when it was shut down in Q1’24 and Q2’24._\n\n  * Combined revenue in Q3’24 for NewCo was $117.3 million. On a standalone basis, Complete Solar’s Q3’24 revenue was $5.5 million of the $20.6 reported for “Dealer”\n\n  * Revenue for Q4’24 is now expected to be $80 million, lower sequentially due to benefits accumulated backlog in Q3 that will not carry over to Q4’24\n\n  * The operating income loss is now expected to drop from ($40.0M) in Q3’24 to $2-11 million in Q4’24 due to the significant headcount reduction \n\n\n\n\nComplete Solar CEO, T.J. Rodgers said, “On Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at our Orem, Utah HQ, we presented to over 1,000 employees the details of our Rev. 5 Annual Operating Plan for cutting headcount and other costs to achieve breakeven operating income in 2025.\n\nRodgers continued, “Our Q3’24 results of $117 million in combined revenue overstates our current revenue rate due to the pileup of SunPower backlog in Q1 & Q2’24. Our current belief is that our revenue will be $80 million in Q4’24, as calculated by extrapolating shipments to known customers from orders in mid-process in our factory.\n\nRodgers concluded, “Our Q3’24 opex of $43.5 million will shrink to $17.0 million in Q4’24 due to actions already implemented with more to follow in each quarter of 2025.”\n\n**About Complete Solar** With its recent acquisition of SunPower assets, Complete Solar has become a leading residential solar services provider in North America.

The corrected release follows:_\n\n[Complete Solar Holdings, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qrTv_Ec0hNLfzn7QWst4_HiBMfibYvXjcWTytl2cQhIzU3hlwNqsJ_Od0yUYKTW4PsvJ0uJq8UDwnAMttyZuygBXNndlO2eLjw5F5SOIwulXOcxRDow1c8auug2ET9-3) d/b/a Complete Solar (“Complete Solar” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CSLR), a solar technology, services, and installation company, today announced preliminary Q3’24 financial results of $117.3 million in revenue with a $42.0 million loss for the post-merger company combining CSLR and SunPower.\n\nComplete Solar CEO, T.J. Rodgers said, “On Wednesday, November 6, 2024, at our Orem, Utah HQ, we will present to over 1,000 employees the details of our Rev. 5 Annual Operating Plan for cutting headcount and other costs to achieve breakeven operating income in 2025. Since my style has always been to present and explain plans broadly to employees, I am releasing the headline information now to preempt any early dissemination of material non-public information prior to our formal November 13 report to shareholders, at which the final financial results will be presented for the old Complete Solar, which has already been merged into the Dealer Division of SunPower.

(We have won the right in court to use the SunPower brand in the future.) First, the $117.3 million Q3’24 revenue contains some revenues that will not repeat Q4’24. This is accounted for in our current formal Q4’24 revenue forecast of $100 million, as stated on the Complete Solar website. Second, we have already implemented a $25.8 million operating expense reduction in Q4’24.
