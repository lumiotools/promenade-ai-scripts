These data were presented today at a Late-Breaking Scientific session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2024, published in _[The New England Journal of Medicine](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2412392&esheet=54153988&newsitemid=20241118710322&lan=en-US&anchor=The+New+England+Journal+of+Medicine&index=2&md5=efe045159160a8c79d72929269a74eda)_[ (_NEJM_)](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2412392&esheet=54153988&newsitemid=20241118710322&lan=en-US&anchor=%28NEJM%29&index=3&md5=a73ee8396f389014faa89c686bdd76b2) and discussed on a company webinar today at 12:00 p.m. ET. \n\n“Data presented today at AHA and published in _The_  _New England Journal of Medicine _represents a critical milestone for the RP-A501 program and cardiac gene therapy in general, demonstrating for the first time that AAV conferred long-term efficacy in a cardiac indication. This program represents the most comprehensive investigational gene therapy dataset for any cardiac condition,” said Gaurav Shah, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Rocket Pharma. “As is true for many other recent internal and peer company programs, when gene therapy works, it is life changing. RP-A501 is being developed as a potential one-time gene therapy and the results of the long-term Phase 1 study show the promise of gene therapy across cardiac diseases, including PKP2-ACM, BAG3-DCM and others.” \n\nThe safety and preliminary efficacy of RP-A501 was evaluated in a single-arm, open-label, multi-center Phase 1 study in male patients with Danon disease. Five patients [pediatric (n=2) and adult/adolescent (n=3)] were treated with the low dose (6.7 x 1013 GC/kg), and 2 adult/adolescent patients were treated with the high dose (1.1 x 1014 GC/kg). Data from the Phase 1 study (cut-off April 19, 2024) showed that RP-A501 in conjunction with a transient immunomodulatory regimen was generally well tolerated. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity, assessed as not related to RP-A501, and non-serious. All RP-A501 or immunomodulatory regimen-related AEs were manageable or reversible. One patient had worsening heart failure at baseline (LVEF <40%) attributed to Danon disease and required heart transplantation for cardiomyopathy progression five months after receiving RP-A501. \n\nEvidence of sustained clinically meaningful improvement was observed in pediatric patients followed up to 24 months and adult/adolescent patients followed up to 60 months. All evaluable patients in the Phase 1 trial demonstrated: \n\n  * Cardiac LAMP2 protein expression at 12 months and thereafter; \n  * Reduction or stabilization of LV mass index – the median reduction from baseline to most recent visit of 24% (for the ongoing pivotal Phase 2 trial, a 10% reduction in LV mass index and positive protein expression of Grade 1 or more are co-primary endpoints); \n  * Preservation of normal LV ejection fraction (LVEF); \n  * Reduction or stabilization of cardiac biomarkers (median cTnI and NTproBNP reductions of 84% and 57%, respectively); \n  * Improvement in New York Heart Association class from Class II at baseline to Class I at most recent follow-up visit; NYHA Class I reflects the absence of clinical signs of heart failure; \n  * Improvements in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire quality-of-life (median improvement of 27 points) scores that persisted up to 54 months of follow-up; and \n  * Preliminary long-term follow-up assessments for Patient 1001 were positive for immunohistochemical staining and appear to show Grade 3 expression in the heart at the five-year timepoint. These are preliminary results with a formal update to be presented at an upcoming medical conference in 2025. \n\n\n\n“The long-term safety and efficacy results in the Phase 1 study are very encouraging for patients with Danon disease. In this study we found consistent, robust improvements and/or normalization across multiple quantifiable parameters that cardiologists use in clinical practice for assessing risk and making management decisions,” said Barry H. Greenberg, MD, FHFSA, Distinguished Professor of Medicine at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Director of the Advanced Heart Failure Treatment Program at UC San Diego Health, primary investigator of the RP-A501 Phase 1 trial and primary author of the manuscript. “Currently, there are no other therapies that have been shown to demonstrate improvement of Danon disease-related cardiomyopathy, and while heart transplantation can prolong life, it is not curative and is associated with significant one-year mortality and complications. Data from this study shows promise for the Danon disease community.” \n\n**Investor Webcast Information** Company management will host a 30-minute call via webcast today, November 18, 2024, at 12:00 p.m. ET.

Danon disease is caused by mutations in the _LAMP2_ gene. \n\nRP-A501 consists of a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) capsid containing a full-length, wild-type version of the human _LAMP2B_ transgene (AAV9.LAMP2B) which, when inserted into cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes) harboring mutations in the endogenous _LAMP2_ gene, has the potential to substantially restore cardiac function by addressing the root cause of Danon disease. RP-A501 is a single dose treatment administered as an intravenous infusion. In preclinical and clinical studies, AAV9.LAMP2B has been generally well tolerated and shown to target cardiomyocytes and deliver the functional _LAMP2B_ gene to heart tissue, which ultimately leads to improvement in cardiac structure and overall clinical function in patients. \n\n**About Danon Disease** Danon disease is a rare X-linked inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2), an important mediator of autophagy. This results in accumulation of autophagosomes and glycogen, particularly in cardiac muscle and other tissues, which ultimately leads to heart failure, and for male patients, frequent death during adolescence or early adulthood. It is estimated to have a prevalence of 15,000 to 30,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe. \n\nThe only available treatment option for Danon disease is cardiac transplantation, which is associated with substantial complications and is not considered curative, representing the high unmet medical need for patients with Danon disease. \n\n**About Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. **Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Danon disease is caused by mutations in the _LAMP2_ gene. \n\nRP-A501 consists of a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) capsid containing a full-length, wild-type version of the human _LAMP2B_ transgene (AAV9.LAMP2B) which, when inserted into cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes) harboring mutations in the endogenous _LAMP2_ gene, has the potential to substantially restore cardiac function by addressing the root cause of Danon disease. RP-A501 is a single dose treatment administered as an intravenous infusion. In preclinical and clinical studies, AAV9.LAMP2B has been generally well tolerated and shown to target cardiomyocytes and deliver the functional _LAMP2B_ gene to heart tissue, which ultimately leads to improvement in cardiac structure and overall clinical function in patients. \n\n**About Danon Disease**\n\nDanon disease is a rare X-linked inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2), an important mediator of autophagy. This results in accumulation of autophagosomes and glycogen, particularly in cardiac muscle and other tissues, which ultimately leads to heart failure, and for male patients, frequent death during adolescence or early adulthood. It is estimated to have a prevalence of 15,000 to 30,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe. \n\nThe only available treatment option for Danon disease is cardiac transplantation, which is associated with substantial complications and is not considered curative, representing the high unmet medical need for patients with Danon disease. \n\n**About Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nRocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: RCKT) is a fully integrated, late-stage biotechnology company advancing a sustainable pipeline of investigational genetic therapies designed to correct the root cause of complex and rare disorders. Rocket’s innovative multi-platform approach allows us to design the optimal gene therapy for each indication, creating potentially transformative options that enable people living with devastating rare diseases to experience long and full lives. \n\nRocket’s lentiviral (LV) vector-based hematology portfolio consists of late-stage programs for Fanconi Anemia (FA), a difficult-to-treat genetic disease that leads to bone marrow failure (BMF) and potentially cancer, Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-I (LAD-I), a severe pediatric genetic disorder that causes recurrent and life-threatening infections which are frequently fatal, and Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD), a monogenic red blood cell disorder resulting in increased red cell destruction and mild to life-threatening anemia. \n\nRocket’s adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based cardiovascular portfolio includes a late-stage program for Danon disease, a devastating heart failure condition resulting in thickening of the heart, an early-stage program in clinical trials for PKP2-arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), a life-threatening heart failure disease causing ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, and a pre-clinical program targeting BAG3-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a heart failure condition that causes enlarged ventricles. \n\nFor more information about Rocket, please visit [www.rocketpharma.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketpharma.com&esheet=54151075&newsitemid=20241112898578&lan=en-US&anchor=www.rocketpharma.com&index=5&md5=b1b40311c8bcb828aac8f7aa9c29a7e6) and follow us on [LinkedIn](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Frocket-pharmaceuticals-ltd&esheet=54151075&newsitemid=20241112898578&lan=en-US&anchor=LinkedIn&index=6&md5=8905dbdc420a31703a81b5587aeaf628), [YouTube](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCfCtYzVk6MTCZoDV5A93Kmg&esheet=54151075&newsitemid=20241112898578&lan=en-US&anchor=YouTube&index=7&md5=397a7103e30d4cb42fc48533bd1a2f95), and [X](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FRocketPharma&esheet=54151075&newsitemid=20241112898578&lan=en-US&anchor=X&index=8&md5=6bd10e848fb9e87a9a5a2540d1fe4771). \n\n**Rocket Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements concerning Rocket’s future expectations, plans and prospects that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they do not materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
