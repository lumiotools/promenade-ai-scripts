(\"Target Hospitality\", \"Target\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: TH), one of North America's largest providers of vertically integrated modular accommodations and value-added hospitality services, today announced the extension and amendment of the Company's Pecos Children's Center (\"PCC\") contract, reaffirmed its previously announced 2024 financial outlook and enhanced its strategic capabilities. \n\nSince 2021, PCC has served as a cornerstone to the U.S. government's critical domestic humanitarian aid mission. The essential nature of this community supported a seamless PCC annual contract extension, representing the community's fifth year of continuous operations and further illustrating the importance of this humanitarian solution. \n\nThe PCC contract extension and amendment (\"PCC Contract\"), effective November 16, 2024, supports a community capable of serving up to 6,000 individuals and will represent annual minimum lease revenue of approximately $168 million. The PCC Contract continues to provide for additional occupancy based variable services revenue depending on active community population. However, given the dynamic fluctuations in community population, Target believes it prudent to continue excluding any incremental PCC variable revenue from its 2024 outlook. \n\nTarget's contract portfolio, including the PCC Contract, supports a high degree of revenue visibility, strong cash generation and an optimized balance sheet. These strong business fundamentals support the Company's reaffirmed 2024 financial outlook.\n\nIn addition, the Company has taken intentional steps to enhance its strategic capabilities as it pursues an expanding pipeline of government services growth opportunities. Specifically, the Company has engaged Carla L. Provost, a former Chief of the United States Border Patrol under the previous Trump administration, to serve as a strategic advisor and government liaison. With over 25 years of service in the U.S. Border Patrol, the Company believes Ms. Provost's knowledge and experience will provide valuable insight as Target actively evaluates multiple government focused strategic growth initiatives.\n\n**About Target Hospitality**\n\nTarget Hospitality is one of North America's largest providers of vertically integrated modular accommodations and value-added hospitality services in the United States. Target builds, owns and operates a customized and growing network of communities for a range of end users through a full suite of value-added solutions including premium food service management, concierge, laundry, logistics, security and recreational facilities services.\n\n**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements made in this press release (including the financial outlook contained herein) are \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(\"Target Hospitality\", \"Target\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: TH), one of North America's largest providers of vertically-integrated modular accommodations and value-added hospitality services, today reported results for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial and Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $95.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Net income of $20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Basic and diluted income per share of $0.20 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $49.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Strong cash generation with approximately $31.4 million of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities and $22.8 million of Discretionary Cash Flow(1) (\"DCF\") for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Significant financial flexibility with approximately $353 million of total available liquidity and a net leverage ratio of 0.0x as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Continued progress towards achieving zero net debt by year end 2024.\n  * Executed approximately $33.2 million of stock repurchases, year to date through November 8, 2024, focused on allocating capital to high return initiatives.\n  * Optimized financial position and enhanced liquidity profile, supports continued evaluation of a robust pipeline of potential diversifying growth opportunities focused on maximizing shareholder value.\n\n\n\n**Executive Commentary**\n\n\"The third quarter results were supported by strong business fundamentals and our proven operational flexibility. These elements enable Target to quickly align with customer demand, while consistently achieving our financial goals,\" stated Brad Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer. \n\n\"Our ability to routinely deliver strong results, through business cycles, has established an optimized balance sheet with an enhanced liquidity profile. We are well positioned, with intentional focus, as we pursue multiple capital allocation opportunities focused on maximizing shareholder value and diversifying our contract portfolio,\" concluded Mr. Archer.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n**Third Quarter Summary Highlights**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended ($ in '000s, except per share amounts) - (unaudited)** | **September 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n**Revenue** | $ | 95,191 | $ | 145,939  \n**Net income** | $ | 20,094 | $ | 45,579  \n**Income per share – basic** | $ | 0.20 | $ | 0.45  \n**Income per share – diluted** | $ | 0.20 | $ | 0.43  \n**Adjusted EBITDA(1)** | $ | 49,705 | $ | 95,044  \n**Average utilized beds** | 13,138 | 14,508  \n**Utilization** | 81 | % | 89 | %  \n  \nRevenue was $95.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $145.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nNet income was $20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $45.6 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $49.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $95.0 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nThe year over year decreases were attributable to the government segment and primarily driven by the previously announced non-cash, nonrecurring, infrastructure enhancement revenue amortization (\"Infrastructure Revenue Amortization\") associated with the Company's Pecos Children's Center (\"PCC\") community, which was fully amortized as of November 2023. In addition, these decreases were partially a result of lower PCC minimum lease and variable services revenue and the previously announced termination of the South Texas Family Residential Center Contract (\"STFRC Contract\") effective August 9, 2024. \n\n**Capital Management**\n\nThe Company had approximately $9.8 million of capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Capital expenditures were predominantly focused on enhancing and maintaining Target's modular accommodations across its expansive network. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $178 million of cash and cash equivalents with approximately $353 million of total available liquidity, no outstanding borrowings on the Company's $175 million credit facility, and a net leverage ratio of 0.0 times. \n\nAs of November 8, 2024, year to date, the Company repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of its common stock for approximately $33.2 million. The stock repurchases, which commenced in January 2024, were executed pursuant to the $100 million stock repurchase program announced in November 2022 and represent approximately 33% of total share repurchase authorization executed to date. This repurchase program may be suspended from time to time, modified, extended or discontinued at certain times. Purchases under the repurchase program may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, and will be subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations and other factors. Any shares of common stock repurchased will be held as treasury shares.\n\n**Business Update and Full Year Outlook**\n\nTarget continues to benefit from strong customer demand and a high degree of revenue visibility, which supports an enhanced financial position and optimized balance sheet. These elements have established an attractive platform as Target continues to focus on allocating capital to value enhancing initiatives, with the objective of expanding and diversifying the Company's contract portfolio. \n\nWith this foundation, Target continues to evaluate a robust pipeline of strategic organic growth initiatives, as well as select in-organic opportunities. These initiatives remain centered on the Company's existing core competencies, providing the ability to utilize Target's premier service offerings to broaden and diversify its customer reach. Importantly, as Target evaluates these opportunities there remains a sharp focus on maintaining its strong financial position through disciplined capital deployment. \n\nRegarding Target's PCC community, since 2021, PCC has served as a cornerstone to the U.S. government's critical domestic humanitarian aid mission supporting unaccompanied minors and the Company anticipates a normal course renewal of this contract in the coming weeks. However, given the dynamic fluctuations in community population, Target believes it prudent to continue to exclude any incremental PCC variable revenue from its 2024 outlook.\n\nTarget's contract portfolio provides a high degree of revenue visibility, coupled with a durable and flexible operating model, supports strong cash generation and an optimized balance sheet. As such, the Company is reiterating its 2024 outlook of:\n\n  * Total revenue between $375 and $385 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(1) between $184 and $190 million\n  * Total capital spending between $25 and $30 million, excluding acquisitions\n  * Zero net debt by year end 2024\n  * Year end 2024 total available liquidity exceeding $350 million\n\n\n\n**Segment Results – Third Quarter 2024**\n\n**Government**\n\n_Refer to exhibits to this earnings release for definitions and reconciliations of Non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended ($ in '000s) - (unaudited)** | **September 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n**Revenue** | $ | 53,482 | $ | 105,541  \n**Adjusted gross profit(1)** | $ | 46,280 | $ | 90,516  \n  \nRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $53.5 million compared to $105.5 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted gross profit for the period was $46.3 million compared to $90.5 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nThese decreases were primarily driven by the non-cash, nonrecurring, Infrastructure Revenue Amortization associated with the Company's PCC community, which was fully amortized as of November 2023. In addition, these decreases were partially attributable to lower PCC minimum lease and variable services revenue and the termination of the STFRC Contract, effective August 9, 2024.\n\n**Hospitality & Facilities Services - South **\n\n_Refer to exhibits to this earnings release for definitions and reconciliations of Non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended ($ in '000s, except ADR) - (unaudited)** | **September 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n**Revenue** | $ | 38,033 | $ | 37,527  \n**Adjusted gross profit(1)** | $ | 12,334 | $ | 14,078  \n**Average daily rate (ADR)** | $ | 72.96 | $ | 75.71  \n**Average utilized beds** | 5,614 | 5,342  \n**Utilization** | 75 | % | 74 | %  \n  \nRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $38.0 million compared to $37.5 million for the same period in 2023.

When used in this press release, the words \"estimates,\" \"projected,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"forecasts,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"future,\" \"propose\" and variations of these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside our control, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors, among others, that may affect actual results or outcomes include: operational, economic, including inflation, political and regulatory risks; our ability to effectively compete in the specialty rental accommodations and hospitality services industry, including growing the HFS – South and Government segments; effective management of our communities; natural disasters and other business distributions including outbreaks of epidemic or pandemic disease; the duration of any future public health crisis, related economic repercussions and the resulting negative impact to global economic demand; the effect of changes in state building codes on marketing our buildings; changes in demand within a number of key industry end-markets and geographic regions; changes in end-market demand requirements including variable occupancy levels associated with subcontracts in the Government segment; our reliance on third party manufacturers and suppliers; failure to retain key personnel; increases in raw material and labor costs; the effect of impairment charges on our operating results; our future operating results fluctuating, failing to match performance or to meet expectations; our exposure to various possible claims and the potential inadequacy of our insurance; unanticipated changes in our tax obligations; our obligations under various laws and regulations; the effect of litigation, judgments, orders, regulatory or customer bankruptcy proceedings on our business; our ability to successfully acquire and integrate new operations; global or local economic and political movements, including any changes in policy under the Trump administration or any future administration; federal government budgeting and appropriations; our ability to effectively manage our credit risk and collect on our accounts receivable; our ability to fulfill Target Hospitality's public company obligations; any failure of our management information systems; our ability to refinance debt on favorable terms and meet our debt service requirements and obligations; and risks related to our outstanding obligations in connection with the Senior Notes. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**(1)****Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains historical non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted gross profit, Discretionary Cash Flow, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, which are measurements not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, in the discussion of our financial results because they are key metrics used by management to assess financial performance. Our business is capital-intensive, and these additional metrics allow management to further evaluate our operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are contained herein. To the extent required, statements disclosing the definitions, utility and purposes of these measures are also set forth herein.\n\nThis press release also contains a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations of this forward-looking measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable to Target Hospitality without unreasonable effort. We cannot provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliation are outside of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliation would require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to us without unreasonable effort. Although we provide a minimum of Adjusted EBITDA that we believe will be achieved, we cannot accurately predict all the components of the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. Target Hospitality provides an Adjusted EBITDA outlook because we believe that this measure, when viewed with our results under GAAP, provide useful information for the reasons noted below.\n\n_Definitions_ :\n\nTarget Hospitality defines Adjusted gross profit, as Gross profit plus depreciation of specialty rental assets, loss on impairment, and certain severance costs.\n\nTarget Hospitality defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation of specialty rental assets, and other depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the following further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect of what management considers transactions or events not related to its core business operations:\n\n  * Other (income) expense, net: Other (income) expense, net includes miscellaneous cash receipts, gains and losses on disposals of property, plant, and equipment, and other immaterial expenses and non-cash items.\n  * Transaction expenses: Target Hospitality incurred advisory fees associated with certain transactions during 2023. During 2024, Target Hospitality incurred expenses associated with certain transactions, primarily driven by the previously announced unsolicited non-binding proposal from Arrow Holdings S.à r.l. (\"Arrow\"), an affiliate of TDR, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company that are not owned by any of Arrow, any investment fund managed by TDR or any of their respective affiliates (the \"Unaffiliated Shares\"), for cash consideration of $10.80 per share (the \"Proposal\").\n  * Stock-based compensation: Charges associated with stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy.\n  * Change in fair value of warrant liabilities: Non-cash change in estimated fair value of warrant liabilities.\n  * Other adjustments: System implementation costs, including non-cash amortization of capitalized system implementation costs, business development, accounting standard implementation costs and certain severance costs.\n\n\n\nTarget Hospitality defines Discretionary Cash Flow as cash flow from operations less maintenance capital expenditures for specialty rental assets.\n\n_Utility and Purposes_ :\n\nEBITDA reflects net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors, and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\n\nTarget Hospitality also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted EBITDA reflects adjustments to exclude the effects of additional items, including certain items, that are not reflective of the ongoing operating results of Target Hospitality. In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude gains or losses on the sale and disposal of depreciable assets and impairment losses because including them in EBITDA is inconsistent with reporting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets. Additionally, the gain or loss on sale and disposal of depreciable assets and impairment losses represents either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods, and depreciation is excluded from EBITDA.\n\nTarget Hospitality also presents Discretionary cash flows because we believe it provides useful information regarding our business as more fully described below. Discretionary cash flows indicate the amount of cash available after maintenance capital expenditures for specialty rental assets for, among other things, investments in our existing business.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, Discretionary Cash Flow, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of Target Hospitality's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to gross profit, net income, or other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of Target Hospitality's liquidity. Adjusted gross profit, Discretionary Cash Flow, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to Target Hospitality to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that is available to it to meet our obligations. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Target Hospitality's management believe that Adjusted gross profit, Discretionary Cash Flows, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors about Target Hospitality and its financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) they are among the measures used by Target Hospitality's management team to evaluate its operating performance; (ii) they are among the measures used by Target Hospitality's management team to make day-to-day operating decisions, (iii) they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results across companies in Target Hospitality's industry.\n\n**Investor Contact:** Mark Schuck(832) 702 – 8009ir@targethospitality.com\n\nExhibit 1  \n---  \n**Target Hospitality Corp.** **Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income** **($ in thousands, except per share amounts)**  \n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,** | **September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(unaudited)** | **(unaudited)** | **(unaudited)** | **(unaudited)**  \n**Revenue:**  \nServices income | $ | 65,796 | $ | 93,538 | $ | 205,685 | $ | 280,897  \nSpecialty rental income | 29,395 | 52,401 | 96,899 | 156,491  \nTotal revenue | 95,191 | 145,939 | 302,584 | 437,388  \nCosts:  \nServices | 31,262 | 34,035 | 101,734 | 109,469  \nSpecialty rental | 4,662 | 7,495 | 16,059 | 23,592  \nDepreciation of specialty rental assets | 14,057 | 17,653 | 43,643 | 53,242  \nGross profit | 45,210 | 86,756 | 141,148 | 251,085  \nSelling, general and administrative | 13,319 | 15,273 | 41,632 | 43,929  \nOther depreciation and amortization | 3,902 | 3,838 | 11,695 | 11,482  \nOther expense (income), net | (2) | (71) | (158) | 1,244  \nOperating income | 27,991 | 67,716 | 87,979 | 194,430  \nLoss on extinguishment of debt | — | — | — | 2,128  \nInterest expense, net | 3,813 | 4,953 | 12,673 | 17,726  \nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities | — | 2,576 | (675) | (1,809)  \nIncome before income tax | 24,178 | 60,187 | 75,981 | 176,385  \nIncome tax expense | 4,084 | 14,608 | 17,118 | 40,528  \nNet income | 20,094 | 45,579 | 58,863 | 135,857  \nLess: Net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest | 100 | — | 100 | —  \nNet income attributable to Target Hospitality Corp. common stockholders -

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call\ntoday. The strength in Target's underlying business fundamentals continues to support strong\nquarterly performance. These fundamentals, along with Target's proven operational flexibility,\nsupport an efficient operating structure and unmatched network capabilities. Together, these\nelements support a highly durable operating model and our ability to deliver strong results\nthrough business cycles.\nOur consistent performance has solidified our strong financial position, while simultaneously\nproviding premium hospitality solutions to our world-class customers. This focused commitment\nhas established an ideal platform centered on the strength of our balance sheet and optimized\nliquidity position to continue advancing our diversifying growth initiatives.\nNow turning to our segment, in the Government segment, our PCC community continues to\nserve as a cornerstone in the U.S. Government's critical domestic Humanitarian Aid Mission.\nThis community stands as the longest-serving influx care facility in the United States, and we\nanticipate a normal course renewal of this contract in the coming weeks, marking its 5th year of\ncontinuous operation.\nRegarding our HFS segment, we continue to benefit from our premier service offerings and the\nvalue our world-class customers find in our network capability. These attributes have supported a\n12% increase in customer demand since the fourth quarter of 2023, further highlighting the\nbenefits of our unique capabilities and our strategically-located network. Additionally, we\ncontinue to focus on identifying incremental operational efficiencies across our segment and\nevaluate opportunities to strengthen margin contribution through enhanced network optimization.\nOur existing Contract portfolio, coupled with consistent customer demand, continues to support a\nhigh degree of revenue visibility and industry-leading cash conversion. With an intentional focus\non solidifying our balance sheet and optimizing our liquidity profile, we have established and\nenhanced our financial position. This commitment has created an ideal platform as we continue\nto focus on allocating capital to value-enhancing growth initiatives with the objective of\nexpanding and diversifying our Contract portfolio.\nWe continue to evaluate an attractive pipeline of strategic growth initiatives, which align with\nour existing service offerings and capabilities. These naturally adjacent opportunities can\nestablish multiple avenues to expand Target's long-term growth profile by broadening our\ncustomer reach and end-market exposure.\nWithin the Government end market, we remain engaged with multiple federal agencies on a\nvariety of solutions they are seeking to implement along the U.S. southern border. Our recent\ndialogue has also included conversations with Republican representatives regarding potential\nsolutions they are considering. As Target continues to evaluate these opportunities, we are\nactively seeking to utilize Target's existing strategically-located South Texas assets to support\nthese solutions.\nFurther, we continue to pursue a growing pipeline of non-government growth initiatives. As we\nhave previously discussed, these opportunities include large industrial projects throughout the\nU.S., including technology infrastructure, energy transition and the increase in domestic\n[railroad] development.\nAs a reminder, the size of these growth opportunities inherently leads to longer sale [cycles].\nWhile we are pleased with the continued dialogue on many of these opportunities, the timing and\nfinal outcomes are uncertain and can be difficult to predict. Additionally, we are evaluating\nselect inorganic opportunities, which we believe can offer exposure to attractive end markets,\nwhile remaining centered around our existing core competencies. These opportunities, coupled\nwith our organic growth initiatives, offer the ability to accelerate our customer diversification\nand growth trajectory.\nAs we evaluate these initiatives, we remain committed to achieving defined objectives of our\ngrowth strategy. Our primary objective remains focused on diversifying our Contract portfolio\nand broadening our customer reach, while continuing to generate strong operating income and\nindustry-leading cash conversion.\nIn summary, the strength of our existing customer base, network capabilities and proven\noperational flexibility consistently supports the achievement of our financial goal. This execution\nhas solidified our financial position centered on an optimized balance sheet and robust liquidity\nprofile. These elements support our ability to continue providing premium hospitality solutions\nto our world-class customers, while simultaneously pursuing attractive growth opportunities.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jason to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail.\nJason Vlacich: Thank you, Brad. Our third quarter results continue to reflect the benefits of our\nefficient operating model and network flexibility. Third quarter 2024 total revenue was\napproximately $95 million with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $50 million. Our\nGovernment segment produced quarterly revenue of approximately $53 million. The decrease in\nrevenue from the prior period was primarily driven by noncash nonrecurring infrastructure\nenhancement revenue associated with the significant expansion that occurred at our PCC\nCommunity in 2022, which was fully amortized as of November 2023.\nIn addition, the decreases were partially attributable to lower PCC minimum lease and variable\nservices revenue and the termination of the South Texas Family Residential Center contract\neffective August 9, 2024.\nOur HFS and other segments delivered quarterly revenue of $42 million. These segments\ncontinue to benefit from consistent [technical difficulty] illustrating the value our customers find\nin our premium hospitality solutions and network capabilities.\nRecurring corporate expenses for the quarter were approximately $10 million. We anticipate\nthese will remain around $9 million to $10 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.\nTotal capital spending for the quarter was approximately $10 million primarily focused on\nenhancing and maintaining Target's asset base across our expansive network. The strength in our\ncore service offering continues to support strong cash generation and an enhanced financial\nprofile. We ended the quarter with $178 million in cash and $353 million in total liquidity with\nzero borrowings under the company's $175 million revolving credit facility and a net leverage\nratio of 0.0x.\nThese impressive financial results, coupled with a high degree of revenue visibility and strong\ncash conversion, support our 2024 financial outlook, which consists of total revenue between\n$375 million and $385 million, and adjusted EBITDA between $184 million and $190 million.\nWe anticipate 2024 capital expenditures of between $25 million $30 million.\nWe continue to progress towards achieving zero net debt and anticipate ending the year with\nover $350 million in total available liquidity.\nAs a reminder, given the dynamic fluctuations in PCC Community population, we believe it is\nprudent to exclude any incremental PCC occupancy-based variable revenue from our 2024\nfinancial outlook. This enhanced financial profile and continued strong cash generation has\nsupported our ability to return approximately $33 million to our shareholders year-to-date\nthrough November 8, 2024 by repurchasing approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock.\nThese repurchases illustrate our focus on utilizing a broad range of initiatives to pursue value-\nenhancing opportunities for our shareholders.\nRegarding our outstanding 2025 senior notes, we continue to evaluate a range of possible\nliability management initiatives focused on further strengthening our financial position, while\nbalancing and expanding pipeline of strategic growth opportunities. This approach is centered on\nmaximizing financial flexibility, enabling us to quickly react to value-enhancing growth\nopportunities as they arise.\nThe strength of our balance sheet, high degree of revenue visibility and continued strong cash\nconversion provides the ability to continue actively evaluating and pursuing strong a pipeline of\ngrowth initiatives. These initiatives, including select inorganic opportunities, are designed to\nleverage Target's operating expertise and existing core competencies to broaden Target's\nContract portfolio and end market reach.\nImportantly, as we evaluate these initiatives, we will remain focused on maintaining the\nenhanced financial profile we have achieved through disciplined capital allocation and strong\ndiscretionary cash flow conversion.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Brad for closing comments.\nBrad Archer: Thanks, Jason. Our third quarter performance further illustrated our proven\noperational flexibility and consistency in achieving our financial goals. We have solidified our\nfinancial position with an optimized balance sheet and enhanced liquidity profile. These strong\nbusiness fundamentals have established the ideal platform as we continue pursuing strategic\ngrowth opportunities focused on expanding and diversifying our contract portfolio, end market\nexposure and customer reach. We are well positioned with intentional focus as we evaluate these\nattractive growth initiatives centered on accelerating value creation for our shareholders.\nI appreciate everyone joining us on the call today, and thank you again for your interest in Target\nHospitality.\nWe will now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.\nQuestions and Answers\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer\nsession. Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Daniel on for Scott. Regarding the demand for your government assets,\nhow do you see the recent election outcome influenced the outlook?\nBrad Archer: Sure. Good morning, this is Brad. Look, we continue to remain actively engaged\nwith the federal agencies. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, as well as Republican\nrepresentatives, we definitely believe the new administration, everybody's seen the policies they\ntalk about, we think it's going to be very positive. We've had continued dialogue as recently as\nthe past few weeks.\nSo look, we're engaged; we have thousands of beds ready for immediate use, with the majority of\nthese beds being used before by different departments within the federal government. We have\nan exceptional past performance record, and we're well positioned to provide many different\nsolutions to many different departments within the agencies. So we look forward to helping. We\nthink we will definitely see a positive trend in the business on that side of it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. You previously talked about the third ICF facility. Do\nyou have any updates regarding that process?\nBrad Archer: Sure. Look, our recent conversations indicate the government's desire and intention\nto continue to proceed with the third ICF, the pace and frequency of those conversations have\nslowed. We believe the government's proceeding through their evaluation and selection process\njust at a more measured pace. When you look at -- they have three 3 facilities now up and\nrunning. That was their push to get that done, so they kind of stepped back. We think it will\ncontinue on at a measured pace, but we don't expect anything substantive till 2025 to get a better\nupdate there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And final one from me. Switching gears to HFS,\nutilization expanded, ADR was down a bit.\nCould you address the outlook for that business? And how do you see the election outcome\ninfluence that?\nJason Vlacich: Yes, so I'll take the first part of that, this is Jason. Thanks for the question. So that\nbusiness has continued to hold steady. We balanced out the ADR with optimization and\nutilization a bit, but the ADR has fluctuated within ranges that we would expect it to fluctuate\nwithin. We're balancing that out in terms of how we see it going forward for the balance of the\nyear. I would expect it to look somewhat like last year with moderate seasonality in Q4 as we've\nexperienced in the past.\nAnd then in terms of the election outcome, Brad can certainly chime in here as well. But to sort\nof set the stage, it's a steady business. It definitely holds -- anchors the business quite nicely. It's\nrelatively mature, and so while there are opportunities, it's a relatively mature business.\nSo Brad, you can certainly chime in on that a little bit more.\nJason Vlacich: Yes, when you talk about the Permian Basin, some of the largest operators -- or\nreally, the largest operators in the world are setting there. That market's matured over the years,\nit's very steady. We think that's what remains of that business, great business for many years to\ncome. And the way we're set up there with our network is, look, if they start to put more capital\nin that area, we're going to benefit without putting much money into it, right? Utilization goes up\nand those types of things.\nBut we're seeing, and what we believe, is they'll remain very disciplined in their capital approach\nright now, right? But if that changes over time, we'll be the benefit of that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Alex Scheibelhoffer of Stifel.\nAlex Scheibelhoffer: I just wanted to follow-up on a few things on the government side of the\nbusiness. Just looking at gross margins in the quarter, they were pretty solid on both the\nsequential and year-over-year basis. I was just wondering if you could maybe give any color on\nhow we should be thinking about that in relation to bridging to your 2024 EBITDA guidance,\nand just how we should think about that going forward as well?\nJason Vlacich: Yes, so with respect to the Government segment, kind of future looking ex-\nDilley, there could be a few percentage points drop in the gross margin, while we hold some of\nthe fixed costs to keep that facility warm for future government opportunities, which we believe\nthere are. But that being said, as obviously, the occupancy goes down, you'll see the margin\nstrengthen.\nSo overall, the margin is not going to change that much. Like I said, you could expect maybe a\nfew percentage points loss just due to some of the fixed costs that will be ongoing at the Dilley\nfacility to keep that warm.\nBrad Archer: Yes, and just to touch on the warm piece, right, like Jason says, we want to --\nsometimes you can walk away from these and you just don't think there's an opportunity, you're\ngoing to look to move it. There's a big opportunity to put that back on lease, right, especially\nwith some of the changes over the past few weeks. So that's always been our case, no matter\nwhat administration got in there. It's a facility we think has a lot of opportunity in 2025, so the\nidea is to keep it warm. There's a little bit more expense there in doing that, but we think it's well\nworth the spend.\nAlex Scheibelhoffer: Got it. Understood. Appreciate the color in there. And that's all for me, so\nI'll turn it back. Thanks again.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-\nand-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Brad Archer. Please go ahead.\nBrad Archer: Thank you all for joining the call today and for your support of Target Hospitality.\nWe look forward to speaking again on our fourth quarter earnings call. Have a great day.\nOperator, that will conclude our call for today.\nOperator: Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines."

In addition, these decreases were partially a result of lower PCC minimum lease and variable services\nrevenue and the previously announced termination of the South Texas Family Residential Center Contract (“STFRC\nContract”) effective August 9, 2024.\nCapital Management\nThe Company had approximately $9.8 million of capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nCapital expenditures were predominantly focused on enhancing and maintaining Target’s modular accommodations across\nits expansive network.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $178 million of cash and cash equivalents with approximately\n$353 million of total available liquidity, no outstanding borrowings on the Company’s $175 million credit facility, and a net\nleverage ratio of 0.0 times.\nAs of November 8, 2024, year to date, the Company repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of its common stock for\napproximately $33.2 million. The stock repurchases, which commenced in January 2024, were executed pursuant to the\n$100 million stock repurchase program announced in November 2022 and represent approximately 33% of total share\nrepurchase authorization executed to date. This repurchase program may be suspended from time to time, modified,\nextended or discontinued at certain times. Purchases under the repurchase program may be made from time to time in\nopen market or privately negotiated transactions, and will be subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements,\ncontractual obligations and other factors. Any shares of common stock repurchased will be held as treasury shares.\nBusiness Update and Full Year Outlook\nTarget continues to benefit from strong customer demand and a high degree of revenue visibility, which supports an\nenhanced financial position and optimized balance sheet. These elements have established an attractive platform as Target\ncontinues to focus on allocating capital to value enhancing initiatives, with the objective of expanding and diversifying the\nCompany’s contract portfolio.\nWith this foundation, Target continues to evaluate a robust pipeline of strategic organic growth initiatives, as well as select\nin-organic opportunities. These initiatives remain centered on the Company’s existing core competencies, providing the\nability to utilize Target’s premier service offerings to broaden and diversify its customer reach. Importantly, as Target\nevaluates these opportunities there remains a sharp focus on maintaining its strong financial position through disciplined\ncapital deployment.\nRegarding Target’s PCC community, since 2021, PCC has served as a cornerstone to the U.S. government’s critical\ndomestic humanitarian aid mission supporting unaccompanied minors and the Company anticipates a normal course\nrenewal of this contract in the coming weeks. However, given the dynamic fluctuations in community population, Target\nbelieves it prudent to continue to exclude any incremental PCC variable revenue from its 2024 outlook.\nTarget’s contract portfolio provides a high degree of revenue visibility, coupled with a durable and flexible operating model,\nsupports strong cash generation and an optimized balance sheet. As such, the Company is reiterating its 2024 outlook of:\n• Total revenue between $375 and $385 million\nTH Q3 2024 Earnings Release Page 2 of 12\n23\n• Adjusted EBITDA(1) between $184 and $190 million\n• Total capital spending between $25 and $30 million, excluding acquisitions\n• Zero net debt by year end 2024\n• Year end 2024 total available liquidity exceeding $350 million\nSegment Results – Third Quarter 2024\nGovernment\nRefer to exhibits to this earnings release for definitions and reconciliations of Non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP\nfinancial measures\nFor the Three Months Ended ($ in ‘000s) - (unaudited) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nRevenue $ 53,482 $ 105,541\nAdjusted gross profit(1) $ 46,280 $ 90,516\nRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $53.5 million compared to $105.5 million for the same period\nin 2023.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise\nany forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by\nlaw.\nTH Q3 2024 Earnings Release Page 4 of 12\n23\n(1) Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains historical non-GAAP financial measures including Adjusted gross profit, Discretionary Cash\nFlow, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, which are measurements not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, in the\ndiscussion of our financial results because they are key metrics used by management to assess financial performance. Our\nbusiness is capital-intensive, and these additional metrics allow management to further evaluate our operating performance.\nReconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are contained herein. To the\nextent required, statements disclosing the definitions, utility and purposes of these measures are also set forth herein.\nThis press release also contains a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations of this\nforward-looking measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable to Target Hospitality\nwithout unreasonable effort. We cannot provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial\nmeasures because certain items required for such reconciliation are outside of our control and/or cannot be reasonably\npredicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliation would require a forward-looking balance\nsheet, statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking\nfinancial statements are unavailable to us without unreasonable effort. Although we provide a minimum of Adjusted EBITDA\nthat we believe will be achieved, we cannot accurately predict all the components of the Adjusted EBITDA calculation.\nTarget Hospitality provides an Adjusted EBITDA outlook because we believe that this measure, when viewed with our\nresults under GAAP, provide useful information for the reasons noted below.\nDefinitions:\nTarget Hospitality defines Adjusted gross profit, as Gross profit plus depreciation of specialty rental assets, loss on\nimpairment, and certain severance costs.\nTarget Hospitality defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt, income\ntax expense (benefit), depreciation of specialty rental assets, and other depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA\nreflects the following further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect of what management\nconsiders transactions or events not related to its core business operations:\n• Other (income) expense, net: Other (income) expense, net includes miscellaneous cash receipts, gains and losses on\ndisposals of property, plant, and equipment, and other immaterial expenses and non-cash items.\n• Transaction expenses: Target Hospitality incurred advisory fees associated with certain transactions during 2023.\nDuring 2024, Target Hospitality incurred expenses associated with certain transactions, primarily driven by the\npreviously announced unsolicited non-binding proposal from Arrow Holdings S.à r.l. (“Arrow”), an affiliate of TDR, to\nacquire all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company that are not owned by any of Arrow, any\ninvestment fund managed by TDR or any of their respective affiliates (the “Unaffiliated Shares”), for cash consideration\nof $10.80 per share (the “Proposal”).\n• Stock-based compensation: Charges associated with stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will\ncontinue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our\ncompensation strategy.\n• Change in fair value of warrant liabilities: Non-cash change in estimated fair value of warrant liabilities.\n• Other adjustments: System implementation costs, including non-cash amortization of capitalized system\nimplementation costs, business development, accounting standard implementation costs and certain severance costs.\nTarget Hospitality defines Discretionary Cash Flow as cash flow from operations less maintenance capital expenditures\nfor specialty rental assets.\nUtility and Purposes:\nEBITDA reflects net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt, provision\nfor income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating\nperformance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business.\nWe also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors, and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain\nitems that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest\nexpense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of\ninterest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary\nTH Q3 2024 Earnings Release Page 5 of 12\n23\nbecause of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in\nwhich they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies.\nEBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because companies utilize productive assets of different\nages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in\nconsiderable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among\ncompanies.\nTarget Hospitality also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted\nEBITDA reflects adjustments to exclude the effects of additional items, including certain items, that are not reflective of the\nongoing operating results of Target Hospitality. In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude gains or losses on the\nsale and disposal of depreciable assets and impairment losses because including them in EBITDA is inconsistent with\nreporting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets. Additionally, the gain or loss on sale and disposal of depreciable\nassets and impairment losses represents either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods, and\ndepreciation is excluded from EBITDA.\nTarget Hospitality also presents Discretionary cash flows because we believe it provides useful information regarding our\nbusiness as more fully described below. Discretionary cash flows indicate the amount of cash available after maintenance\ncapital expenditures for specialty rental assets for, among other things, investments in our existing business.\nAdjusted gross profit, Discretionary Cash Flow, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of Target Hospitality’s\nfinancial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to gross profit, net income, or other\nperformance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as\nmeasures of Target Hospitality’s liquidity. Adjusted gross profit, Discretionary Cash Flow, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nshould not be considered as discretionary cash available to Target Hospitality to reinvest in the growth of our business or\nas measures of cash that is available to it to meet our obligations. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Amounts in Thousands, Unless Stated Otherwise)\n1. Organization and Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Nature of Operations\nTarget Hospitality Corp. (“Target Hospitality” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) was formed on March 15,\n2019 and is one of North America’s largest providers of vertically integrated specialty rental and value-added hospitality\nservices. The Company provides vertically integrated specialty rental and comprehensive hospitality services including:\ncatering and food services, maintenance, housekeeping, grounds-keeping, security, health and recreation services, overall\nworkforce community management, and laundry service. Target Hospitality serves clients in the natural resources\ndevelopment and government sectors principally located in the West Texas, South Texas, New Mexico and Midwest regions.\nThe Company, whose securities are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Topaz\nHoldings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Topaz”), and Arrow Bidco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company\n(“Arrow Bidco”), serve as the holding companies for the businesses of Target Logistics Management, LLC and its subsidiaries\n(“Target” or “TLM”) and RL Signor Holdings, LLC (“Signor”). TDR Capital LLP (“TDR Capital” or “TDR”) indirectly owns\napproximately 64% of Target Hospitality and the remaining ownership is broken out among the founders of the Company’s\nlegal predecessor, Platinum Eagle Acquisition Corp. (“Platinum Eagle” or “PEAC”), investors who purchased the shares of\nPlatinum Eagle in a private placement transaction, and other public shareholders.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pertaining to interim financial information. Certain information in footnote\ndisclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States (“US GAAP”) has been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. The financial\nstatements included in this report should be read in conjunction with Target Hospitality’s Annual Report on the Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\nThe results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the\noperating results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 or any future period.\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring\nadjustments, necessary for a fair statement of financial position as of September 30, 2024, and results of operations for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, was derived from the audited\nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company, but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from those annual financial\nstatements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions by\nmanagement in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. If the underlying estimates and assumptions upon which the financial statements are based change in future periods,\nactual amounts may differ from those included in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.\n9\nTable of Contents\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries that it controls\ndue to ownership of a majority voting interest or if the subsidiary is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) where the Company has\nbeen determined to be the primary beneficiary. For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the third-party\nownership interest represents a noncontrolling interest, which is presented separately in the consolidated financial statements.\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Company obtains control, and\ncontinue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared\nfor the same reporting period as the Company. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives revenue from specialty rental and hospitality services, specifically lodging and related ancillary\nservices. Revenue is recognized in the period in which lodging and services are provided pursuant to the terms of contractual\nrelationships with the customers. Certain arrangements contain a lease of lodging facilities to customers. The leases are\naccounted for as operating leases under the authoritative guidance for leases (“ASC 842”) and are recognized as income is\nearned over the term of the lease agreement.\nUpon lease commencement, the Company evaluates leases to determine if they meet criteria set forth in lease accounting\nguidance for classification as sales-type leases or direct financing leases; if a lease meets none of these criteria, the Company\nclassifies the lease as an operating lease. As previously mentioned, the arrangements that contain a lease of the Company’s\nlodging facilities are accounted for as operating leases, whereby the underlying asset remains on our balance sheet and is\ndepreciated consistently with other owned assets, with income recognized as it is earned over the term of the lease agreement.\nFor contracts that contain both a lease component and a services or non-lease component, the Company has adopted an\naccounting policy to account for and present the lease component under ASC 842 and the non-lease component under the\nauthoritative guidance for revenue recognition (“ASC 606” or “Topic 606”). Refer to Note 2 for the breakout of revenue under\neach standard. The Company recognizes minimum rents on operating leases over the term of the customer operating lease. A\nlease term commences when: (1) the customer has control of the leased space (legal right to use the property); and (2) the\nCompany has delivered the premises to the customer as required under the terms of the lease. The term of a lease includes the\nnoncancellable periods of the lease along with periods covered by: (1) a customer option to extend the lease if the customer is\nreasonably certain to exercise that option; (2) a customer option to terminate the lease if the customer is reasonably certain not\nto exercise that option; and (3) an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease in which exercise of the option is controlled\nby the Company as the lessor. When assessing the expected lease end date, judgment is required in contemplating the\nsignificance of: any penalties a customer may incur should it choose not to exercise any existing options to extend the lease or\nexercise any existing options to terminate the lease; and economic incentives for the customer in the lease. Furthermore, when\nassessing the expected end date of a contract under ASC 606 with an extension option, judgment is required to determine\nwhether the option contains a material right.\nBecause performance obligations related to specialty rental and hospitality services are satisfied over time, the majority of our\nrevenue is recognized evenly over the contractual term of the arrangement, based on a contractual fixed minimum amount and\ndefined period of performance. Some of our revenue is recognized on a daily basis, for each night a customer stays, at a\ncontractual day rate. Our customers typically contract for accommodation services under committed contracts with terms that\nmost often range from several months to multiple years. Our payment terms vary by type and location of our customer and the\nservice offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.\nWhen lodging and services are billed and collected in advance, recognition of revenue is deferred until services are rendered.\nCost of services includes labor, food, utilities, supplies, leasing and other direct costs associated with operating the lodging\nunits as well as repair and maintenance expenses. Cost of rental includes leasing costs, utilities, and other direct costs of\nmaintaining the lodging units. Costs associated with contracts include sales commissions which are expensed as incurred and\nreflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, the Company collects sales, use, occupancy and similar taxes, which the Company presents on a net basis\n(excluded from revenues) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, which expands\nreportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The\namendments in the ASU require, among other things, disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to\nan entity's chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and a description of other segment items (the difference between\nsegment revenue less the segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of\nsegment profit or loss) by reportable segment, as well as disclosure of the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation\nof how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how\nto allocate resources. Annual disclosures are required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim\ndisclosures are required for periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Retrospective application is\nrequired, and early adoption is permitted. These requirements are not expected to have an impact on our financial statements,\nbut will result in expanded reportable segment disclosures. The Company does not intend to early adopt ASU 2023-07.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which requires disclosure of\ndisaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and\nmodifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024,\nmay be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and allows for early adoption. These requirements are not expected to have an\nimpact on our financial statements, but will impact our income tax disclosures. The Company does not intend to early adopt\nASU 2023-09.\nRecent Developments\nOn March 25, 2024, the Company announced that the Board of Directors of the Company (“the Board”) received an\nunsolicited non-binding proposal from Arrow Holdings S.à r.l. (“Arrow”), an affiliate of TDR, to acquire all of the outstanding\nshares of Common Stock of the Company that are not owned by any of Arrow, any investment fund managed by TDR or any\nof their respective affiliates (the “Unaffiliated Shares”), for cash consideration of $10.80 per share (the “Proposal”).\nThe Board established a special committee of independent directors (the \"Special Committee\"), and the Special Committee\nretained Centerview Partners LLC and Ardea Partners LP as its financial advisors and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP as its\nlegal advisor. The Special Committee was established to consider and evaluate the Proposal, and explore and consider\nstrategic alternatives thereto.\nIn connection with its review of the Proposal, the Special Committee launched a formal process to solicit offers for the\nCompany and invited Arrow to participate in such a process. Following the previously announced loss of a contract, no formal\noffers were received, and Arrow did not reaffirm the Proposal or advance any alternative proposal that the Special Committee\ncould conclude, in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, would be more attractive to the holders of\nthe Unaffiliated Shares than the Company’s standalone prospects. Accordingly, the Board determined to disband the Special\nCommittee, as previously announced on September 25, 2024.\n2. Revenue\nTotal revenue recognized under ASC 606 was approximately $205.7 million and $280.9 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, while specialty rental income was approximately $96.9 million and $156.5\nmillion subject to the guidance of ASC 842 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. Total\nrevenue recognized under contracts recognized under ASC 606 was approximately $65.8 million and $93.5 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, while specialty rental income was approximately $29.4\n11\nTable of Contents\nmillion and $52.4 million subject to the guidance of ASC 842 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nThe following table disaggregates our services income by our two reportable segments as well as the All Other category:\nHospitality and Facility Services – South (“HFS – South”), Government, and All Other for the dates indicated below:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nHFS – South $ 36,456 $ 36,004 $ 108,775 $ 107,938\nGovernment $ 25,665 $ 54,662 $ 88,473 $ 164,245\nAll Other $ 3,675 $ 2,872 $ 8,437 $ 8,714\nTotal services revenues $ 65,796 $ 93,538 $ 205,685 $ 280,897\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains allowances for credit losses. These allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables\nthat we will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts that affect collectability. Our estimate could require a change based on changing circumstances,\nincluding changes in the economy or in the circumstances of individual customers.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nWe do not have any contract assets.\nContract liabilities primarily consist of deferred revenue that represent payments for room nights that the customer may use in\nthe future as well as advanced payments for community builds, and mobilization of asset activities related to community\nexpansions that are being recognized over the related contract period. Activity in the deferred revenue accounts as of the dates\nindicated below was as follows:\nFor Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nBalances at Beginning of the Period $ 5,469 $ 125,519\nAdditions to deferred revenue 400 —\nRevenue recognized (4,933) (106,112)\nBalances at End of the Period $ 936 $ 19,407\nAs a result of the termination of the South Texas Family Residential Center Contract effective August 9, 2024 in the\nCompany’s Government Segment, the Company recognized the $4.9 million of deferred revenue remaining at December 31,\n2023 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as is reflected in the above table, with $2.7 million of the\n12\nTable of Contents\namount recognized upon termination of the contract during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when no further\nservice obligation existed.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the following table discloses the estimated revenues under ASC 606 related to performance\nobligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) and when we expect to recognize the revenue, and only represents\nrevenue expected to be recognized from contracts where the price and quantity of the product or service are fixed:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024 2025 2026 2027 Total\nRevenue expected to be recognized as of September 30, 2024 $ 15,037 $ 9,213 $ 3,625 $ 1,192 $ 29,067\nThe Company applied some of the practical expedients in ASC 606, including the “right to invoice” practical expedient, and\ndoes not disclose consideration for remaining performance obligations for contracts without minimum revenue commitments\nor for variable consideration related to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations. Due to the application of\nthese practical expedients as well as excluding rental income revenue subject to the guidance included in ASC 842, the table\nabove represents only a portion of the Company’s expected future consolidated revenues and it is not necessarily indicative of\nthe expected trend in total revenues.\n3.

These disposals were primarily\nassociated with fully depreciated asset retirement costs as well as a sale of assets. These asset disposals resulted in disposal\ncosts of approximately $1.2 million and a net loss on the sales and disposal of assets of approximately $0.2 million (net of sale\nproceeds of approximately $0.2 million) and is reported within other expense (income), net in the accompanying consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n13\nTable of Contents\n4.

Debt\nSenior Secured Notes 2024\nOn March 15, 2019, Arrow Bidco issued $340 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior secured notes due March\n15, 2024 (the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”) under an indenture dated March 15, 2019 (the “2024 Notes Indenture”). The 2024\nNotes Indenture was entered into by and among Arrow Bidco, the guarantors named therein (the “2024 Senior Secured Note\nGuarantors”), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee and as collateral agent. Interest was payable semi-\nannually on September 15 and March 15 and began September 15, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany made an elective repayment of approximately $5.5 million on the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. On March 15, 2023,\nArrow Bidco redeemed $125 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes. The\nredemption was accounted for as a partial extinguishment of debt. In connection with the Notes Exchange Offer (defined in\nthe Company’s 2023 Form 10-K), approximately $181.4 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes were exchanged by Arrow\nBidco on November 1, 2023 for new 10.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Senior Secured Notes”). Following\nthis exchange and related transactions, approximately $28.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes\nremained outstanding, which were subsequently redeemed on November 21, 2023 resulting in an outstanding balance of $0 as\nof December 31, 2023. As such, none of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding. Refer to the “Notes Exchange\nOffer” section within Note 8 of the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the exchange and subsequent\npay off of the remaining 2024 Senior Secured Notes.\nSenior Secured Notes 2025\nIn connection with the Notes Exchange Offer, as previously mentioned, on November 1, 2023 (the “Notes Exchange Offer\nSettlement Date”), approximately $181.4 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes were exchanged by Arrow Bidco and Arrow\nBidco issued approximately $181.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an\nindenture, dated November 1, 2023, by and among Arrow Bidco, the guarantors from time to time party thereto and Deutsche\nBank Trust Company Americas, as trustee and collateral agent (the “2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture”). The 2025 Senior\nSecured Notes will mature on June 15, 2025.

On and after September 15, 2024, Arrow Bidco, at its option, may redeem any outstanding\n2025 Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than fifteen (15) nor more than sixty (60) days’ prior written\nnotice to holders and not less than twenty (20) days’ prior written notice to the Trustee (or such shorter timeline as the Trustee\nmay agree), at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes to be\nredeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the applicable redemption date\n(subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date falling on or prior\nto the redemption date), if redeemed during the 6-month period beginning on the dates set forth below at the redemption prices\nlisted below:\nRedemption\nDate Price\nSeptember 15, 2024 102.000%\nMarch 15, 2025 and thereafter 101.000%\nThe 2025 Senior Secured Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Topaz and each of Arrow Bidco’s direct and indirect\nwholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the “2025 Note Guarantors”). Target Hospitality is not an issuer or a\nguarantor of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. The 2025 Note Guarantors are either borrowers or guarantors under the ABL\nFacility. To the extent lenders under the ABL Facility release the guarantee of any 2025 Note Guarantor, such 2025 Note\nGuarantor is also released from obligations under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. These guarantees are secured by a second\npriority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Arrow Bidco and the 2025 Note Guarantors (subject to customary\nexclusions). The guarantees of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes by TLM Equipment, LLC, a Delaware limited liability\ncompany which holds certain of Target Hospitality’s assets, are subordinated to its obligations under the ABL Facility (as\ndefined below).\nThe 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains covenants that limit Arrow Bidco’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among\nother things, (i) incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain types of stock, (ii) create or incur certain liens, (iii) make\ncertain payments, including dividends or other distributions, (iv) prepay or redeem junior debt, (v) make certain investments\nor acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures, (vi) engage in certain transactions with affiliates and (vii) sell assets,\nconsolidate or merge with or into other companies. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and\nexceptions. In addition, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Arrow Bidco must offer to repurchase the\n2025 Senior Secured Notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but excluding, the\napplicable repurchase date. The 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture also provides for events of default, to which, if any of\nthem occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all of the\nthen outstanding 2025 Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately.\nArrow Bidco’s ultimate parent, Target Hospitality, has no significant independent assets or operations except as included in the\nguarantors of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the guarantees under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes are full and unconditional\nand joint and several, and any subsidiaries of Target Hospitality that are not subsidiary guarantors of the 2025 Senior Secured\nNotes are minor. There are also no significant restrictions on the ability of Target Hospitality or any guarantor to obtain funds\nfrom its subsidiaries by dividend or loan. See discussion of certain negative covenants above. Therefore, pursuant to the SEC\nRules, no individual guarantor financial statement disclosures are deemed necessary.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, there was an original issue discount of approximately $2.7\nmillion and the unamortized balance of approximately $1.3 million as of September 30, 2024 is presented as a\n17\nTable of Contents\nreduction of the principal within current portion of long-term debt, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The\ndiscount is amortized over the life of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method.\nFinance Lease and Other Financing Obligations\nThe Company’s finance lease and other financing obligations as of September 30, 2024 consisted of approximately $2.5\nmillion of finance leases. The finance leases pertain to leases entered into during 2017 through September 30, 2024, for\ncommercial-use vehicles with 36-month terms (and continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter) expiring through 2027.\nThe Company’s finance lease and other financing obligations as of December 31, 2023 consisted of approximately $2.4\nmillion of finance leases related to commercial-use vehicles with the same terms as described above.\nABL Facility\nOn March 15, 2019, Topaz, Arrow Bidco, Target, Signor and each of their domestic subsidiaries entered into an ABL credit\nagreement that provided for a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to\n$125 million (the “ABL Facility”), which was increased to $175 million with the Third Amendment discussed below. During\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, no amounts were drawn or repaid on the ABL Facility resulting in an outstanding\nbalance of $0 as of September 30, 2024.\nIn accordance with the First Amendment to the ABL Facility on February 1, 2023 (the “First Amendment”), the reference\ninterest rate for LIBOR borrowings changed from LIBOR to Term SOFR (commencing as of the effective date of the First\nAmendment).\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility, at the relevant borrower’s (the borrowers under the ABL Facility, the “Borrowers”)\noption, bear interest at either (1) Term SOFR or (2) a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin\nis 4.25% to 4.75% with respect to Term SOFR borrowings and 3.25% to 3.75% with respect to base rate borrowings based on\nachieving certain excess availability levels. The rates of the applicable margin were determined in connection with the Third\nAmendment to the ABL Facility on October 12, 2023 (the “Third Amendment”).\nPursuant to the Third Amendment, the ABL Facility provides borrowing availability of an amount equal to the lesser of (a)\n$175 million and (b) the Borrowing Base (defined below) (the “Line Cap”).\nThe Borrowing Base is, at any time of determination, an amount (net of reserves) equal to the sum of:\n● 85% of the net book value of the Borrowers’ eligible accounts receivables, plus\n● the lesser of (i) 95% of the net book value of the Borrowers’ eligible rental equipment and (ii) 85% of the net orderly\nliquidation value of the Borrowers’ eligible rental equipment, minus\n● customary reserves\nThe ABL Facility includes borrowing capacity available for standby letters of credit of up to $25 million and for ‘‘swingline’’\nloan borrowings of up to $15 million. Any issuance of letters of credit or making of a swingline loan will reduce the amount\navailable under the ABL Facility.\nIn addition, the ABL Facility will provide the Borrowers with the option to increase commitments under the ABL Facility in\nan aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million plus any voluntary prepayments that are accompanied by permanent\ncommitment reductions under the ABL Facility. As a result of the First Amendment, the termination date of the ABL Facility\nwas extended from September 15, 2023 to February 1, 2028, which extended termination date was subject to a springing\nmaturity that would have accelerated the maturity of the ABL Facility. On August 10, 2023, Arrow Bidco and certain of the\nCompany’s other subsidiaries entered into a second amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the ABL Facility. The Second\nAmendment amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, modify the springing maturity that would have accelerated the\nmaturity of the ABL Facility if any of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remained outstanding from the date that was six months\nprior to the stated maturity date thereof to the date that was ninety-one days prior to the stated maturity date thereof. Finally,\nthe Third Amendment amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, set the\n18\nTable of Contents\ntermination date of the ABL Facility to February 1, 2028, subject to springing maturity triggers that will accelerate the\nmaturity of the ABL Facility if: (i) any of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding on the date that is ninety-one\ndays prior to the stated maturity date thereof or (ii) any of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes (or any indebtedness incurred to\nrefinance the 2025 Senior Secured Notes) remain outstanding on the date that is ninety-one days prior to the stated maturity\ndate thereof. As previously mentioned, none of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding.\nThe obligations under the ABL Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Topaz and each existing and subsequently acquired\nor organized direct or indirect wholly-owned U.S. organized restricted subsidiary of Arrow Bidco (together with Topaz, the\n“ABL Guarantors”), other than certain excluded subsidiaries. The ABL Facility is secured by (i) a first priority pledge of the\nequity interests of Topaz, Arrow Bidco, Target, and Signor (the “Borrowers) and of each direct, wholly-owned US organized\nrestricted subsidiary of any Borrower or any ABL Guarantor, (ii) a first priority pledge of up to 65% of the voting equity\ninterests in each non-US restricted subsidiary of any Borrower or ABL Guarantor and (iii) a first priority security interest in\nsubstantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the ABL Guarantors (in each case, subject to customary exceptions).\nAs stated in the Third Amendment, the ABL Facility requires the Borrowers to maintain a (i) minimum fixed charge coverage\nratio of not less than 1.00:1.00 and (ii) maximum total leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00.\nThe ABL Facility also contains a number of customary negative covenants. Such covenants, among other things, limit or\nrestrict the ability of each of the Borrowers, their restricted subsidiaries, and where applicable, Topaz, to:\n● incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock and make guarantees;\n● incur liens on assets;\n● engage in mergers or consolidations or fundamental changes;\n● sell assets;\n● pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock;\n● make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions;\n● amend organizational documents and master lease documents;\n● enter into certain agreements that would restrict the ability to pay dividends;\n● repay certain junior indebtedness; and\n● change the conduct of its business.\nThe aforementioned restrictions are subject to certain exceptions including (i) the ability to incur additional indebtedness,\nliens, investments, dividends and distributions, and prepayments of junior indebtedness subject, in each case, to compliance\nwith certain financial metrics and certain other conditions and (ii) a number of other traditional exceptions that grant the\nBorrowers continued flexibility to operate and develop their businesses. The ABL Facility also contains certain customary\nrepresentations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.\nThe carrying value of debt outstanding as of the dates indicated below consist of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nFinance lease and other financing obligations $ 2,540 $ 2,393\n10.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025, face amount 181,446 181,446\nLess: unamortized original issue discount (1,330) (2,619)\nLess: unamortized term loan deferred financing costs (373) (734)\nTotal debt, net 182,283 180,486\nLess: current maturities (181,289) (1,369)\nTotal long-term debt $ 994 $ 179,117\n19\nTable of Contents\nInterest expense, net\nThe components of interest expense, net (which includes interest expense incurred) recognized in the unaudited consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income for the periods indicated below consist of the following, including the components of\ninterest expense, net on the 2024 and 2025 Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Notes”):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest incurred on finance lease and other financing\nobligations $ 75 $ 56 $ 215 $ 148\nInterest expense incurred on ABL Facility and Notes 5,044 5,096 15,129 17,660\nAmortization of deferred financing costs on ABL Facility and\nNotes 277 688 817 2,441\nAmortization of original issue discount on Notes 443 124 1,289 437\nInterest income (2,026) (1,011) (4,777) (2,960)\nInterest expense, net $ 3,813 $ 4,953 $ 12,673 $ 17,726\nDeferred Financing Costs and Original Issue Discount\nThe Company presents unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount as a direct deduction\nfrom the principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. Accumulated amortization expense related to the deferred financing costs was\napproximately $13.9 million and $13.5 million as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accumulated\namortization of the original issue discount was approximately $4.4 million and $3.1 million as September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. As previously mentioned, the partial redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on\nMarch 15, 2023 was accounted for as a partial extinguishment of debt and consequently, a portion of the unamortized deferred\nfinancing costs and unamortized original issue discount were expensed through loss on extinguishment of debt on the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income as of the prepayment date. The Company recognized a charge of\napproximately $1.7 million in loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs\nand unamortized original issue discount for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nAccumulated amortization related to revolver deferred financing costs for the ABL Facility was approximately $5.7 million\nand $5.3 million as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Revolver deferred financing costs are presented\non the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 within deferred financing costs revolver,\nnet. In connection with the First Amendment, which was considered a modification for accounting purposes, any unamortized\ndeferred financing costs from the ABL Facility that pertained to non-continuing lenders were expensed through loss on\nextinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as of the amendment date. As such, the\nCompany recognized a charge of approximately $0.4 million in loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of\nunamortized deferred financing costs pertaining to non-continuing lenders for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As\nthe borrowing capacity of each of the continuing lenders on the amended ABL Facility was greater than the borrowing\ncapacity of the ABL Facility before the amendment, the unamortized deferred financing costs at the time of the modification\nof approximately $0.4 million associated with the continuing lenders was deferred and amortized over the remaining term of\nthe ABL Facility. Additionally, the Company incurred and paid approximately $1.4 million and $1.0 million of deferred\nfinancing costs as a result of the First Amendment and Third Amendment of the ABL Facility, which are capitalized and\npresented on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, within deferred\nfinancing costs revolver, net. These costs are amortized over the contractual term of the line-of-credit through the maturity\ndate using the straight-line method.\nRefer to the components of interest expense in the table above for the amounts of the amortization expense related to the\ndeferred financing costs and original issue discount recognized for each of these debt instruments for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n20\nTable of Contents\nFuture maturities\nThe aggregate annual principal maturities of debt and finance lease obligations for each of the next five years, based on\ncontractual terms are listed in the table below.\nThe schedule of future maturities as of September 30, 2024, consists of the following:\nRest of 2024 $ 936\n2025 182,348\n2026 555\n2027 147\nTotal $ 183,986\n9. Warrant Liabilities\nOn January 17, 2018, Harry E. Sloan, Joshua Kazam, Fredric D. Rosen, the Sara L. Rosen Trust and the Samuel N. Rosen\n2015 Trust, purchased from PEAC an aggregate of 5,333,334 warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant (for an aggregate\npurchase price of $8.0 million) in a private placement (the “Private Warrants”) that occurred simultaneously with the\ncompletion of its initial public offering. Each Private Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at\n$11.50 per share. The purchase price of the Private Warrants was added to the proceeds from the Public Offering and was held\nin the Trust Account until the formation of the Company on March 15, 2019. The Private Warrants (including the shares of\nCommon Stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Warrants) were not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after\nthe formation of the Company on March 15, 2019, and they may be exercised on a cashless basis and are non-redeemable so\nlong as they are held by the initial purchasers of the Private Warrants or their permitted transferees.\nThe Company evaluated the Private Warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own\nEquity, and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity and should be classified as\nliabilities. Since the Private Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, the Company recorded the Private\nWarrants as liabilities on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value.\nSubsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the Private Warrants are reflected in the change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The change in the estimated fair value of\nthe Private Warrants resulted in a gain of approximately $(0.7) million and $(1.8) million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the change in the\nestimated fair value of the Private Warrants resulted in a loss of $0 and approximately $2.6 million, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, 0 and 1,533,334, Private Warrants were outstanding, respectively. The Private Warrants expired\nunredeemed on March 15, 2024 and are no longer outstanding.\nThe Company determined the following estimated fair values for the outstanding Private Warrants as of the dates indicated\nbelow:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nWarrant liabilities $ — $ 675\nTotal $ — $ 675\n10. Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense was approximately $17.1 million and $40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 income tax expense was approximately $4.1 million and\n$14.6 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 16.9% and\n24.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 22.5% and 23.0%,\nrespectively. The fluctuation in the tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\n21\nTable of Contents\nrespectively, results primarily from the relationship of income before income tax for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, differs from the US\nfederal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the permanent add-back related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities\non the Company’s warrants, nonrecognition of tax benefits for loss jurisdictions, the impact of state tax expense based off of\ngross receipts, a state tax rate change during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of North Dakota’s\nweighted sales factor election, and a compensation deduction limitation.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in interim periods under ASC 740-270, Income Taxes – Interim Reporting, which\ngenerally requires us to apply an estimated annual consolidated effective tax rate to consolidated pre-tax income. In addition,\nthe guidance under ASC 740 further provides that, in establishing the estimated annual effective tax rate, the Company\nexcludes losses from jurisdictions in which no tax benefit is expected to be recognized for such losses.\n11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a\ncurrent transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.\nThe Company has assessed that the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, other current\nliabilities, and other debt approximates their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities or recent\ncommencement of these instruments. The fair value of the ABL Facility is primarily based upon observable market data, such\nas market interest rates, for similar debt. The fair value of the Notes is based upon observable market data.\nThe Company measured the Private Warrant liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period end as more\nfully discussed below. Changes in the fair value of the Private Warrants at each reporting period end date were recognized\nwithin the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the change in fair value of warrant liabilities.\nLevel 1 & 2 Disclosures:\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, which are either Level 1 or Level 2, are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCarrying Carrying\nFinancial Assets (Liabilities) Not Measured at Fair Value Amount Fair Value Amount Fair Value\nABL Facility (See Note 8) - Level 2 $ — $ — $ — $ —\nSenior Secured Notes (See Note 8) - Level 1 $ (179,743) $ (185,302) $ (178,093) $ (187,797)\n22\nTable of Contents\nRecurring fair value measurements\nLevel 3 Disclosures:\nThere were 0 and 1,533,334 Private Warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nBased on the fair value assessment that was performed, the Company determined a fair value price per Private Warrant of\n$0.00 and $0.44 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value is classified as Level 3 in the\nfair value hierarchy due to the use of pricing inputs that are less observable in the marketplace combined with management\njudgment required for the assumptions underlying the calculation of value. The Company determined the estimated fair value\nof the Private Warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The Private Warrants expired unredeemed on\nMarch 15, 2024 and are no longer outstanding.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits or claims in the ordinary course of business. Management is of the opinion that\nthere is no pending claim or lawsuit which, if adversely determined, would have a material impact on the financial condition\nof the Company.\n13. Earnings (Loss) per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS” or “LPS”) is calculated by dividing net income or loss attributable to Target Hospitality\nby the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed\nsimilarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were\nexercised. We apply the treasury stock method in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. During periods when net losses\nare incurred, potential dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share\nfor that period. Net income was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following\ntable reconciles net income attributable to common stockholders and the weighted average shares outstanding for the basic\ncalculation to the net income attributable to common stockholders and\n23\nTable of Contents\nthe weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted calculation for the periods indicated below ($ in thousands, except per\nshare amounts):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator\nNet income attributable to Target Hospitality Corp.\nCommon Stockholders - basic $ 19,994 $ 45,579 $ 58,763 $ 135,857\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities — — — (1,809)\nNet income attributable to Target Hospitality Corp.\nCommon Stockholders - diluted $ 19,994 $ 45,579 $ 58,763 $ 134,048\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 100,438,559 101,620,537 100,452,691 101,246,546\nDilutive effect of outstanding securities:\nWarrants — 1,201,020 — 1,728,214\nPSUs 511,871 526,674 479,391 495,718\nSARs 858 210,299 108,238 264,269\nStock Options 104,125 427,347 180,800 545,229\nRSUs 241,091 1,107,817 523,342 1,352,163\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 101,296,504 105,093,694 101,744,462 105,632,139\nNet income per share attributable to Target Hospitality\nCorp.

The Public and Private Warrants representing a total of 8,044,287 shares of the Company’s Common Stock for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were included in the computation of diluted EPS because their effect is\ndilutive as noted in the above table. No Public or Private Warrants were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 given they\nexpired on March 15, 2024; therefore, the Public and Private Warrants had no impact on the computation of diluted EPS for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs discussed in Note 15, stock-based compensation awards were outstanding for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. These stock-based compensation awards were included in the computation of diluted EPS for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 because their effect is dilutive as noted in the above table. For the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation awards were included in the computation of diluted\nEPS because their effect is dilutive as noted in the above table. However, approximately 841,944 of contingently issuable\nPSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as not all\nnecessary conditions for issuance of these PSUs were satisfied, which includes 216,944 of PSUs that did not meet all of the\nCompany’s Diversification EBITDA and TSR criteria (see Note 15) and 625,000 of PSUs issued in 2022 that did not meet all\nof the specified share price thresholds as discussed in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K.\nShares of treasury stock have been excluded from the computation of EPS.\n24\nTable of Contents\n14. Stockholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Target Hospitality had 112,158,984 and 111,091,266 shares of Common\nStock, par value $0.0001 per share issued with 100,303,879 and 101,660,601 outstanding, respectively. Each share of\nCommon Stock has one vote.\nPreferred Shares\nTarget Hospitality is authorized to issue 1,000,000 preferred shares at $0.0001 par value. As of September 30, 2024, no\npreferred shares were issued and outstanding.\nPublic Warrants\nOn January 17, 2018, PEAC sold 32,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “Units”) in its initial public offering (the\n“Public Offering”), including the issuance of 2,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ partial exercise of their\noverallotment option. Each Unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share of PEAC, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Public\nShares”), and one-third of one warrant to purchase one ordinary share (the “Public Warrants”).\nEach Public Warrant entitled the holder to purchase one share of the Company’s Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share.\nNo fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. If upon exercise of the Public Warrants, a holder\nwould be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company will upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole\nnumber, the number of shares to be issued to the Public Warrant holder. Each Public Warrant became exercisable 30 days after\nthe formation of the Company.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, holders of Public Warrants exercised 1,079 Public Warrants for shares of\nCommon Stock resulting in the Company receiving cash proceeds of less than $0.1 million and issuing 1,079 shares of\nCommon Stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 0 Public Warrants issued and outstanding given they expired on\nMarch 15, 2024.\nCommon Stock in Treasury\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted into law and imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the\nnet value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The Company reflected the applicable excise tax in\nequity as part of the cost basis of the stock repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded a\ncorresponding liability for the excise taxes payable in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 in an amount of approximately $0.1 million.\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes the Company\nto repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock. The stock repurchase program does not obligate\nthe Company to purchase any particular number of shares, and the timing and exact amount of any repurchases will depend on\nvarious factors, including market pricing and conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations, and other\nfactors. Any shares of common stock repurchased will be held as treasury shares. Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of\nstockholders’ equity at cost.\nThe Company may repurchase its shares in open market transactions from time to time or through privately negotiated\ntransactions in accordance with federal securities laws, at the Company's discretion. The repurchase program, which has no\nexpiration date, may be increased, suspended, or terminated at any time. The program is expected to be implemented over the\ncourse of several years and is conducted subject to the covenants in the agreements governing the Company's indebtedness.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 2,424,440 shares of Common Stock for an\naggregated price of approximately $22.3 million (excluding the excise tax discussed above). During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 150,000 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate price of\n25\nTable of Contents\napproximately $1.1 million (excluding the excise taxes of less than $0.1 million). As of September 30, 2024, the stock\nrepurchase program had a remaining capacity of approximately $77.7 million.\n15. Stock-Based Compensation\nOn February 29, 2024, the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the\nCompany adopted a new form 2024 Executive Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the “RSU Agreement”) and a new form 2024\nExecutive Performance Stock Unit Agreement (the “PSU Agreement” together with the RSU Agreement, the “Award\nAgreements”) with respect to the granting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”),\nrespectively, under the Target Hospitality Corp. 2019 Incentive Plan (as amended, the “Plan”). The new Award Agreements\nwill be used for all awards to executive officers made on or after February 29, 2024.\nThe RSU Agreement has material terms that are substantially similar to those in the form 2023 Executive Restricted Stock\nUnit Agreement last approved by the Compensation Committee and previously disclosed by the Company in the 2023 Form\n10-K.\nEach PSU awarded under the PSU Agreement represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock, par\nvalue $0.0001 per share. PSUs vest and become unrestricted on the third anniversary of the grant date. The number of PSUs\nthat vest pursuant to the PSU Agreement is based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (the “TSR Based Award”)\nperformance and the Company’s Diversification EBITDA (as defined in the PSU Agreement) (the “Diversification EBITDA\nBased Award”), each measured based on the applicable Performance Period specified in the PSU Agreement. The number of\nPSUs that vest pursuant to the TSR Based Award range from 0% to 200% of the Target Level (as defined in the PSU\nAgreement) depending upon the achievement of a specified percentile rank during the applicable Performance Period. The\nnumber of PSUs that vest pursuant to the Diversification EBITDA Based Award range from 0% to 200% of the Target Level\n(as defined in the PSU Agreement) depending upon the Company’s Diversification EBITDA (as defined in the PSU\nAgreement) during the applicable Performance Period. Vesting of PSUs is contingent upon the executive’s continued\nemployment through the vesting date, unless the executive’s employment is terminated by reason of death, without Cause, for\nGood Reason, or in the event of a Change in Control (each term as defined in the Plan).\nRestricted Stock Units\nOn February 29, 2024, the Compensation Committee awarded an aggregate of 350,128 time-based RSUs to certain of the\nCompany’s executive officers and other employees, which vest ratably over a four-year period.\nOn May 23, 2024, the Compensation Committee awarded an aggregate of 62,823 time-based RSUs to certain of the\nCompany’s non-employee directors, which vest in full on the first anniversary of the grant date or, if earlier, the date of the\nfirst annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the grant date.\nThe table below represents the changes in RSUs:\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nNumber of Date Fair Value\nShares per Share\nBalance at December 31, 2023 1,682,206 $ 4.65\nGranted 412,951 9.92\nVested (1,001,998) 3.86\nForfeited (125,792) 5.66\nBalance at September 30, 2024 967,367 $ 7.59\nStock-based compensation expense for these RSUs recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was\napproximately $2.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit of approximately $0.7 million and\n$1.0 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation\n26\nTable of Contents\nexpense for RSUs was approximately $0.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit of $0.2\nmillion and $0.3 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs totaled\napproximately $6.7 million and is expected to be recognized over a remaining term of approximately 2.45 years.\nPerformance Stock Units\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company awarded an aggregate of 203,057 PSUs to certain of the Company’s executive officers\nand employees, which vest upon satisfaction of continued service with the Company until the third anniversary of the Grant\nDate and attainment of the Company’s Diversification EBITDA and TSR criteria. These PSUs were valued using a Monte\nCarlo simulation with the following assumptions on the grant date: the expected volatility was approximately 36.30%, the\nterm was 2.84 years, the correlation coefficient was 0.5832, the dividend rate was 0.0% and the risk-free interest rate was\napproximately 4.41%, which resulted in a calculated fair value of approximately $13.50 per PSU as of the grant date.\nThe table below represents the changes in PSUs:\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nNumber of Date Fair Value\nShares per Share\nBalance at December 31, 2023 1,358,868 $ 5.23\nGranted 203,057 11.59\nForfeited (160,518) 6.36\nBalance at September 30, 2024 1,401,407 $ 6.02\nStock-based compensation expense for these PSUs recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was approximately\n$1.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit of approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million,\nrespectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation expense was\napproximately $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit of $0.2 million and $0.3 million,\nrespectively. At September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to PSUs totaled approximately $3.6 million\nand is expected to be recognized over a remaining term of approximately 1.72 years.\nStock Option Awards\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were changes in stock options as shown in the following table.\nWeighted\nAverage Weighted\nExercise Price Average Intrinsic\nPer Contractual Life Value ($ in\nOptions Share (Years) thousands)\nOutstanding Options at December 31, 2023 740,439 $ 6.55 5.17 $ 2,570\nExercised (348,389) 5.31 - 1,620\nVested and expired (29,941) 10.83 - -\nOutstanding Options at September 30, 2024 362,109 $ 7.38 5.07 $ 646\n362,109 stock options were exercisable at September 30, 2024.\nStock-based compensation expense for these stock option awards recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in\nthe consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was\napproximately $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit of approximately less than $0.1\nmillion and $0.1 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation\nexpense was $0 and approximately $0.1 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit of $0 and less\n27\nTable of Contents\nthan $0.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to stock\noptions.\nThe fair value of each option award at the grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the\nfollowing assumptions:\nAssumptions\nWeighted average expected stock volatility (range) % 25.94 - 30.90\nExpected dividend yield % 0.00\nExpected term (years) 6.25\nRisk-free interest rate (range) % 0.82 - 2.26\nExercise price (range) $ 4.51 - 10.83\nThe volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is based on peer group volatility as the Company\ndid not have a sufficient trading history as a stand-alone public company to calculate volatility at the time of estimating the\nfair value of each option at the grant date. Additionally, due to an insufficient history with respect to stock option activity and\npost vesting cancellations, the expected term assumption is based on the simplified method permitted under SEC rules,\nwhereby, the simple average of the vesting period for each tranche of award and its contractual term is aggregated to arrive at\na weighted average expected term for the award. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the\nimplied US Treasury bill yield curve at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the Company’s expected term\nassumption. The Company has never declared or paid a dividend on its shares of Common Stock.\nStock-based payments are subject to service based vesting requirements and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. No stock options were forfeited during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nStock Appreciation Right Awards\nAs approved by the Compensation Committee, 755,436 of the employee related exercised SARs shown in the table below\nwere paid in cash in the amount of $10.0 million based on the difference between (a) the fair market value of a share of\nCommon Stock on the date of exercise, over (b) the grant date price; during the first quarter of 2023.\nAs approved by the Compensation Committee, 13,453 of the employee related exercised SARs shown in the table below were\npaid in cash in the amount of $0.1 million based on the difference between (a) the fair market value of the share of Common\nStock on the date of exercise, over (b) the grant price; during the third quarter of 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as approved by the Compensation Committee, 714,539 of the employee\nrelated exercised SARs shown in the table below were paid in cash in the amount of $6.2 million based on the difference\nbetween (a) the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise, over (b) the grant date price.\nThe table below represents the changes in SARs:\nWeighted-Average\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual\nNumber of Units Exercise Price Term (Years)\nOutstanding SARs at December 31, 2023 714,539 $ 1.82 7.17\nExercised (714,539) 1.82 -\nOutstanding SARs at September 30, 2024 - $ - -\nThere were no SARs outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2024.\nUnder the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation, these SARs are considered liability-based awards. The\nCompany recognized a liability associated with its SARs of $0 as of September 30, 2024 as there were no SARs\n28\nTable of Contents\noutstanding and unexercised as of September 30, 2024. The liability associated with these SAR awards recognized as of\nDecember 31, 2023 was approximately $5.4 million, all of which is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. These SARs were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model\nwith the following assumptions on the grant date: the expected volatility was approximately 43.5%, the term was 6.25 years,\nthe dividend rate was 0.0% and the risk-free interest rate was approximately 1.07%, which resulted in a calculated fair value\nof approximately $0.78 per SAR as of the grant date. The fair value of these liability awards was remeasured at each reporting\nperiod until the date of settlement. As of September 30, 2024, there were no remaining outstanding SARs. At\nDecember 31, 2023, these SARs were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions\nfor awards granted on February 25, 2021 and August 5, 2021, respectively: the expected volatility was approximately 35.78%\nand 53.39%, the term was 0.08 years and 0.30 years, the dividend yield was 0.0% and 0.0%, the risk-free rate was\napproximately 5.52% and 5.33%, and the exercise price was $1.79 and $3.54, which resulted in a calculated fair value of\napproximately $7.95 and $6.25 per SAR, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\nThe estimated weighted-average fair value of each SAR as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $0 and $7.96,\nrespectively. Increases and decreases in stock-based compensation expense are recognized over the vesting period, or\nimmediately for vested awards. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized\ncompensation expense related to these awards of approximately $0.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively, in selling, general\nand administrative expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized compensation expense related to these awards of $0 and $2.2 million,\nrespectively. At September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to SARs totaled $0 as there are no SARs\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024.\nThe volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for purposes of estimating the fair value as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and the grant date, is based on peer group volatility as the Company did not have a sufficient trading\nhistory as a stand-alone public company to calculate volatility as of December 31, 2023 and as of the grant date. Additionally,\ndue to an insufficient history with respect to stock appreciation right activity and post vesting cancellations, the expected term\nassumption on the grant date was based on the simplified method permitted under SEC rules, whereby, the simple average of\nthe vesting period for each tranche of award and its contractual term is aggregated to arrive at a weighted average expected\nterm for the award. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the implied US Treasury bill yield\ncurve at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the Company’s expected term assumption. The Company has never\ndeclared or paid a dividend on its shares of common stock.\nStock-based payments are subject to service based vesting requirements and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. No SARs were forfeited during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n16.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTARGET HOSPITALITY CORP. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition,\nliquidity and capital resources of Target Hospitality Corp. and is intended to help the reader understand Target Hospitality\nCorp., our operations and our present business environment. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the\nCompany’s unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nExecutive Summary\nTarget Hospitality Corp. is one of North America’s largest providers of vertically integrated specialty rental and value-added\nhospitality services including: catering and food services, maintenance, housekeeping, grounds-keeping, security, health and\nrecreation facilities, overall workforce community management, concierge services and laundry service. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our network included 28 communities, to better serve our customers across the US and Canada.\nEconomic Update\nOn June 10, 2024, the Company received notice that the U.S. government intended to terminate the South Texas Family\nResidential Center contract (“STFRC Contract”), effective in 60 days, on August 9, 2024. As such, effective on August 9,\n2024, the STFRC Contract was terminated and no longer contributed to total consolidated revenue of the Company from that\ntermination date of August 9, 2024. The STFRC Contract was based on a fixed minimum lease revenue commitment and for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, contributed approximately $55.9 million in total consolidated revenue, all of which is\nrelated to the Company’s Government segment. The Company will retain ownership of the South Texas Family Residential\nCenter assets enabling the Company to continue utilizing these modular solutions to support customer demand across its\nexisting operating segments and other potential growth opportunities. The Company’s Government segment continued to\nbenefit from the Pecos Children’s Center (“PCC”) and the New PCC Contract that became effective November 16, 2023. The\nPCC Community contributed lower revenues as compared to the third quarter of 2023 driven primarily by lower non-cash\nrevenue amortization of an advanced payment for community expansion associated with the prior contract that became fully\namortized as of November 2023, and to a lesser extent, by a decrease in the minimum lease revenue component of the New\nPCC Contract compared to the prior contract that ended in November 2023. The Company generated cash inflows from\noperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately $121.1 million compared to approximately $118.5\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase in cash flows from operations of\napproximately $2.6 million or 2% driven by an increase in cash collections, a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset\nby an increase in cash paid for income taxes, an $8.7 million decrease in cash paid for interest driven by a significant\nreduction in debt outstanding during the current period compared to the prior period, and an increase in interest income.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company also purchased 2,424,440 shares of Common Stock for an\naggregate purchase price of approximately $22.3 million (exclusive of estimated excise taxes of approximately $0.1 million).\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, other key drivers of financial performance included:\n● Decreased revenue of $50.7 million, or 35% compared to the same period in 2023, driven by lower revenue\ngenerated from the Government segment primarily from lower non-cash revenue amortization of an advanced\npayment for community build-out and mobilization of asset activities associated with the Company’s PCC\ncommunity, which was fully amortized as of November 2023.\n● Generated net income of approximately $20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared\nto a net income of approximately $45.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily\nattributable to a decrease in revenue and the change in the estimated fair value of warrant liabilities, partially offset\nby a decrease service costs driven primarily by lower costs in the Government segment as a result of operational\nefficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the\n34\nTable of Contents\nPCC Community, a decrease in specialty rental costs, a decrease in depreciation of specialty rental assets, a decrease\nin selling, general and administrative expenses led by a decrease in stock compensation expense, an increase in\ninterest income earned on cash equivalents funded by the increase in available cash as a result of cash flows from\noperations, and a decrease in income tax expense led by a decrease in income before income tax.\n● Generated consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $49.7 million representing a decrease of $45.4 million, or 48% as\ncompared to the same period in 2023, driven primarily by the decrease in revenue led by the lower non-cash revenue\namortization mentioned above that ended in November 2023 associated with the prior PCC Contract, partially offset\nby a 13% decrease in operating expenses comprised of a decrease in services costs and specialty rental costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is Net Income.\nPlease see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition and reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure.\nOur Government segment, including several communities in West, Texas supporting critical United States government\nhumanitarian aid efforts, delivers essential services and accommodations near the southern United States border where there is\ninsufficient housing and infrastructure solutions to appropriately care for unaccompanied minor immigrants. Demand for these\ncommunities and services is influenced by immigration activity, where continued increases in migrant populations has\nincreased government spending and demand for appropriate government supported solutions. Demand for these communities\nand services is also impacted by federal government budgeting, appropriations, and federal government administration policy\ndecisions.\nOur proximity to customer activities influences occupancy and demand. We have built, own and operate the largest specialty\nrental and hospitality services network available to customers operating in the HFS – South region. Our broad network often\nresults in us having communities that are the closest to our customers’ job sites, which reduces commute times and costs, and\nimproves the overall safety of our customers’ workforce. Our communities provide customers with cost efficiencies, as they\nare able to jointly use our communities and related infrastructure (i.e., power, water, sewer and IT) services alongside other\ncustomers operating in the same vicinity. Demand for our services is dependent upon activity levels, particularly our\ncustomers’ capital spending on natural resource development activities.\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations\nWe expect our business to continue to be affected by the key factors discussed below, as well as factors discussed in the\nsection titled “Risk Factors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and\ninformation currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available\ninformation prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nSupply and Demand for Natural Resources\nAs a provider of vertically integrated specialty rental and hospitality services, we are not directly impacted by commodity\nprice fluctuations. However, these price fluctuations indirectly influence our activities and results of operations because the\nnatural resource development workforce is directly affected by price fluctuations and the industry’s expansion or contraction\nas a result of these fluctuations. Our occupancy volume depends on the size of the workforce within the natural resources\nindustry and the demand for labor. Commodity prices are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control,\nincluding the domestic and global supply of and demand for natural resources, the commodities trading markets, as well as\nother supply and demand factors that may influence commodity prices.\nAvailability and Cost of Capital\nCapital markets conditions could affect our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets to the extent necessary to fund\nour future growth. Interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our\nfinancing costs to increase accordingly, and could limit our ability to raise funds, or increase the price of raising funds, in the\ncapital markets and may limit our ability to expand.\n35\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Compliance\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning\nmatters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid, and hazardous waste handling and disposal and the investigation\nand remediation of contamination. In addition, we may be subject, indirectly, to various statutes and regulations applicable to\ndoing business with the U.S. government as a result of our contracts with U.S. government contractor clients. The risks of\nsubstantial costs, liabilities, and limitations on our operations related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an\ninherent part of our business, and future conditions may develop, arise, or be discovered that create substantial compliance or\nenvironmental remediation liabilities and costs.\nPublic Policy\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our subcontracts with government contractors. The U.S. government and,\nby extension, our U.S. government contractor customers, may from time to time adopt, implement or modify certain policies\nor directives that may adversely affect our business. Changes in government policy, presidential administration or other\nchanges in the political landscape relating to immigration policies may similarly result in a decline in our revenues in the\nGovernment segment.\nNatural Disasters or Other Significant Disruption\nAn operational disruption in any of our facilities could negatively impact our financial results. The occurrence of a natural\ndisaster, such as earthquake, tornado, severe weather including hail storms, flood, fire, or other unanticipated problems such as\npublic health threats or outbreaks, labor difficulties, equipment failure, capacity expansion difficulties or unscheduled\nmaintenance could cause operational disruptions of varied duration. These types of disruptions could materially adversely\naffect our financial condition and results of operations to varying degrees dependent upon the facility, the duration of the\ndisruption, our ability to shift business to another facility or find alternative solutions.\nOverview of Our Revenue and Operations\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from specialty rental accommodations and vertically integrated hospitality services.\nApproximately 68% of our revenue was earned from specialty rental with vertically integrated hospitality services,\nspecifically lodging and related ancillary services, whereas the remaining 32% of revenues were earned through leasing of\nlodging facilities the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue is recognized in the period in which lodging and\nservices are provided pursuant to the terms of contractual relationships with our customers. In certain of our contracts, rates\nmay vary over the contract term, in these cases, revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term.\nWe enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables for which arrangement consideration is allocated between lodging and\nservices based on the relative estimated standalone selling price of each deliverable. The estimated price of lodging and\nservices deliverables is based on the prices of lodging and services when sold separately or based upon the best estimate of\nselling price.\nKey Indicators of Financial Performance\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as\nsignificant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and tend to review these measurements frequently for\nconsistency and trend analysis. We primarily review the following profit and loss information when assessing our\nperformance:\nRevenue\nWe analyze our revenues by comparing actual revenues to our internal budgets and projections for a given period and to prior\nperiods to assess our performance. We believe that revenues are a meaningful indicator of the demand and pricing for our\nservices. Key drivers to change in revenues may include average utilization of existing beds, levels of development activity in\nthe HFS – South segment, the consumer price index impacting government contracts, and government spending on housing\nprograms.\n36\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nWe analyze our adjusted gross profit, which is a Non-GAAP measure, which we define as revenues less cost of sales,\nexcluding impairment and depreciation of specialty rental assets to measure our financial performance. Please see “Non-\nGAAP Financial Measures” for a definition and reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. We believe adjusted\ngross profit is a meaningful metric because it provides insight into the financial performance of our revenue streams without\nconsideration of company overhead. Additionally, using adjusted gross profit gives us insight on factors impacting cost of\nsales, such as efficiencies of our direct labor and material costs. When analyzing adjusted gross profit, we compare actual\nadjusted gross profit to our budgets and internal projections and to prior period results for a given period in order to assess our\nperformance.\nWe also use Non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows to evaluate the\noperating performance of our business. For a more in-depth discussion of the Non-GAAP measures, please refer to the \"Non-\nGAAP Financial Measures\" section.\nSegments\nWe have identified two reportable business segments: HFS – South and Government:\nHFS – South\nThe HFS – South segment reflects our facilities and operations in the HFS – South region from customers in the natural\nresources development industry and includes our 16 communities located across Texas and New Mexico.\nGovernment\nThe Government segment includes the facilities and operations of the family residential center and the related support\ncommunities in Dilley, Texas (the “South Texas Family Residential Center”) provided under a lease and services agreement\nwith a national provider of migrant programming (the “FRCC Partner”). As previously mentioned, the contract for the South\nTexas Family Residential Center with the FRCC Partner terminated on August 9, 2024. The Company retains ownership of\nthe assets associated with the South Texas Family Residential Center enabling the Company to continue utilizing these\nmodular solutions to support customer demand across its existing operating segments and other potential growth\nopportunities. Additionally, this segment also includes facilities and operations provided under a lease and services agreement\nwith our NP Partner, backed by a committed U.S. Government contract, to provide a suite of comprehensive service offerings\nin support of their humanitarian aid efforts.\nAll Other\nOur other facilities and operations which do not meet the criteria to be a separate reportable segment are consolidated and\nreported as “All Other” which represents the facilities and operations of one community in Canada, three communities in\nNorth Dakota, and the catering and other services provided to communities and other workforce accommodation facilities for\nthe natural resource development industries not owned by us.\nKey Factors Impacting the Comparability of Results\nThe historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either to each other or to our future\nresults of operations, for the reasons described below:\nGovernment Segment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company executed the Expanded Humanitarian Contract that went into effect\nin May 2022 to provide enhanced infrastructure and comprehensive facility services that support the critical hospitality\nsolutions the Company provides to the NP Partner and the United States Government in their humanitarian aid missions. The\nExpanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a significant scope expansion and term extension for the\n37\nTable of Contents\ncontinuation of services provided under the agreement that originated in March 2021. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract\noperated with similar structure to the Company’s prior government services subcontracts, which are centered around minimum\nrevenue commitments supported by the United States Government. Additionally, the Expanded Humanitarian Contract\nincluded occupancy-based variable services revenue that aligned with active community population. The minimum revenue\ncommitments, which consisted of annual recurring lease revenue and nonrecurring infrastructure enhancement revenue,\nprovided for a minimum annual revenue contribution of approximately $390 million and was fully committed over its initial\ncontract term. Inclusive of all potential occupancy-based variable services revenue, the Expanded Humanitarian Contract\nprovided for a maximum initial annual total contract amount of approximately $575 million. On May 15, 2023, the Company\nexecuted a six-month extension of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract, which extended the period of performance through\nNovember 15, 2023 and increased the contract value, with no change to contract structure or any other existing economic\nterms. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract expired as of November 15, 2023. The non-recurring infrastructure enhancement\nrevenue was generated from an advance payment made during the year ended December 31, 2022 for the community build-\nout, and mobilization of asset activities related to the community expansion associated with the Expanded Humanitarian\nContract. The advanced payment was determined to be related to future services to be amortized to revenue over the\nestimated term of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract. This advance payment revenue amortization ended when the\nExpanded Humanitarian Contract expired on November 15, 2023. As such, the prior period for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 included this revenue amortization in the amount of approximately $35.3 million and $104.8\nmillion, respectively. whereas the current period does not. Additionally, the Expanded Humanitarian Contract included an\nannual minimum lease revenue commitment of approximately $196 million that impacted the prior period compared to the\ncurrent period being impacted by an annual minimum lease revenue commitment of approximately $178 million under the\nNew PCC Contract explained below.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company executed the New PCC Contract, pursuant to an Indefinite Delivery,\nIndefinite Quantity Task Order between our NP Partner and the United States Government, that replaced the Expanded\nHumanitarian Contract and became effective on November 16, 2023. The New PCC Contract includes a one-year base period\nthrough November 15, 2024, an option to extend for up to four additional one-year periods, and an option to extend for up to\nsix months upon the conclusion of the base period or any of the option periods. Under the New PCC Contract, the Company\nwill maintain similar facility size and operational scope compared to the Expanded Humanitarian Contract. The New PCC\nContract operates with similar structure to the Company’s prior and existing government services subcontracts, which are\ncentered around minimum revenue commitments supported by the United States Government. Additionally, the New PCC\nContract includes occupancy-based variable services revenue that will align with active community population. The minimum\nrevenue commitments, which consist of annual recurring lease revenue, provide for a minimum annual revenue contribution\nof approximately $178 million. Assuming all option periods are exercised, the 5-year cumulative minimum revenue\ncommitment of the New PCC Contract is expected to be approximately $892 million through 2028.\nAdditionally, as previously mentioned, the STFRC Contract terminated on August 9, 2024 and no longer contributed to total\nconsolidated revenue of the Company from that termination date of August 9, 2024.\nAs such, the termination of the STFRC Contract as well as the change from the prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract to the\nNew PCC Contract impacts comparability between periods.\n38\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations have been prepared using the historical periods included in our\nunaudited consolidated financial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 ($ in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended Amount of Percentage Change\nSeptember 30, Increase Increase\n2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease)\nRevenue:\nServices income $ 65,796 $ 93,538 $ (27,742) (30)%\nSpecialty rental income 29,395 52,401 (23,006) (44)%\nTotal revenue 95,191 145,939 (50,748) (35)%\nCosts:\nServices 31,262 34,035 (2,773) (8)%\nSpecialty rental 4,662 7,495 (2,833) (38)%\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets 14,057 17,653 (3,596) (20)%\nGross Profit 45,210 86,756 (41,546) (48)%\nSelling, general and administrative 13,319 15,273 (1,954) (13)%\nOther depreciation and amortization 3,902 3,838 64 2%\nOther income, net (2) (71) 69 (97)%\nOperating income 27,991 67,716 (39,725) (59)%\nInterest expense, net 3,813 4,953 (1,140) (23)%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities — 2,576 (2,576) (100)%\nIncome before income tax 24,178 60,187 (36,009) (60)%\nIncome tax expense 4,084 14,608 (10,524) (72)%\nNet income 20,094 45,579 (25,485) (56)%\nLess: Net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest 100 — 100 100%\nNet income attributable to Target Hospitality Corp. common\nstockholders $ 19,994 $ 45,579 $ (25,585) (56)%\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nTotal Revenue. Total revenue was $95.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of $65.8\nmillion of services income and $29.4 million of specialty rental income. Total revenue for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was $145.9 million, which consisted of $93.5 million of services income and $52.4 million of specialty\nrental income.\nServices income consists primarily of specialty rental and vertically integrated and comprehensive hospitality services,\nincluding room revenue, catering and food services, maintenance, housekeeping, grounds-keeping, security, overall workforce\ncommunity management, health and recreation facilities, concierge services, and laundry service. The main driver of the\ndecrease in services income revenue year over year was lower revenue in the Government segment in the current period from\nthe decrease in the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from\nthe prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023, partially by lower minimum lease revenue as\nwell as lower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current period, and the termination of the\nSTFRC Contract.\nSpecialty rental income consists primarily of revenues from leasing rooms and other facilities at certain communities that\ninclude contractual arrangements with customers that are considered leases under the authoritative accounting guidance for\nleases. Specialty rental income decreased primarily as a result of lower revenue in the Government segment from the decrease\nin the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from\n39\nTable of Contents\nthe prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023, partially by lower minimum lease revenue as\nwell as lower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current period, and the termination of the\nSTFRC Contract.\nCost of services. Cost of services was $31.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $34.0\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in services costs is primarily due to a decrease in\nservices costs from the Government segment driven by operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with\ncertain leases that were terminated at the PCC Community, including lease terminations as a result of the purchase of certain\npreviously leased equipment and partially by the termination of the STFRC contract in the Government segment as previously\ndiscussed. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs of approximately $2.2 million in the HFS-South\nsegment to support increased customer demand.\nSpecialty rental costs. Specialty rental costs were $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\n$7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in specialty rental costs is primarily due to a\ndecrease in costs from the Government segment driven by operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with\ncertain leases that were terminated at the PCC Community, and partially by the termination of the STFRC contract in the\nGovernment segment as previously discussed.\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets. Depreciation of specialty rental assets was $14.1 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to $17.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in\ndepreciation expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in depreciation on certain specialty rental assets and related\nleasehold improvements acquired or built in 2022 to support growth of the Government segment related to the contract that\noriginated in May of 2022 with the NP Partner, which became fully depreciated during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDecreases in depreciation expense associated with HFS-South specialty rental assets also partially contributed to this decrease\nin depreciation of specialty rental assets for certain site work assets that became fully depreciated during 2024.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative was $13.3 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to $15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expense from the prior period as a result of a decrease in stock compensation expense of\napproximately $3.2 million led primarily by the liability-based stock appreciation right awards (“SARs”) driven by a lower\nnumber of SAR awards outstanding during the current period compared to the prior period as approximately 50% of such\nawards were outstanding as of September 30, 2023 compared to 0% in the current period as there are no remaining awards\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024 as these awards vested and were exercised as of September 30, 2024. This was offset by\nan increase in transaction fees of approximately $1.5 million associated primarily with the Proposal described in “Recent\nDevelopments” in Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form\n10-Q. The remaining change was primarily driven by a decrease in non-cash amortization of capitalized system\nimplementation costs that became fully amortized during 2024.\nOther depreciation and amortization. Other depreciation and amortization expense was $3.9 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 as compared to $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other\ndepreciation and amortization is primarily driven by an increase in depreciation associated with an increase in finance leases\nfor commercial use vehicles.\nOther expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net was less than $(0.1) million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to ($0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\n$5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in interest expense, net was primarily driven by an\nincrease in interest income earned on cash equivalents funded by the increase in available cash as a result of cash flows from\noperations.\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities represents the fair value adjustments to\nthe outstanding Private Warrant liabilities based on the change in their estimated fair value at each reporting period end.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe change in fair value of the warrant liabilities was $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $2.6\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the Private Warrants expiring unredeemed on March 15,\n2024 as discussed in Note 9 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this\nForm 10-Q.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense was $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\n$14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to\nthe decrease in income before taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 led by a decrease in revenue, partially\noffset by cost decreases previously mentioned.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023($ in thousands):\nFor the Nine Months Ended Amount of Percentage Change\nSeptember 30, Increase Increase\n2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease)\nRevenue:\nServices income $ 205,685 $ 280,897 $ (75,212) (27)%\nSpecialty rental income 96,899 156,491 (59,592) (38)%\nTotal revenue 302,584 437,388 (134,804) (31)%\nCosts:\nServices 101,734 109,469 (7,735) (7)%\nSpecialty rental 16,059 23,592 (7,533) (32)%\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets 43,643 53,242 (9,599) (18)%\nGross Profit 141,148 251,085 (109,937) (44)%\nSelling, general and administrative 41,632 43,929 (2,297) (5)%\nOther depreciation and amortization 11,695 11,482 213 2%\nOther expense (income), net (158) 1,244 (1,402) (113)%\nOperating income 87,979 194,430 (106,451) (55)%\nLoss on extinguishment of debt — 2,128 (2,128) (100)%\nInterest expense, net 12,673 17,726 (5,053) (29)%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (675) (1,809) 1,134 (63)%\nIncome before income tax 75,981 176,385 (100,404) (57)%\nIncome tax expense 17,118 40,528 (23,410) (58)%\nNet income 58,863 135,857 (76,994) (57)%\nLess: Net income attributable to the\nnoncontrolling interest 100 — 100 100%\nNet income attributable to Target Hospitality\nCorp. common stockholders $ 58,763 $ 135,857 $ (77,094) (57)%\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nTotal Revenue. Total revenue was $302.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of $205.7\nmillion of services income and $96.9 million of specialty rental income. Total revenue was $437.4 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 and consisted of $280.9 million of services income and $156.5 million of specialty rental income.\nServices income consists primarily of specialty rental and vertically integrated and comprehensive hospitality services,\nincluding room revenue, catering and food services, maintenance, housekeeping, grounds-keeping, security, overall workforce\ncommunity management, health and recreation facilities, concierge services, and laundry service. The main driver of the\ndecrease in services income revenue year over year was lower revenue in the Government segment in the current period from\nthe decrease in the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from\nthe prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023, partially by lower minimum lease revenue as\nwell as lower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current\n41\nTable of Contents\nperiod, and the termination of the STFRC Contract, partially offset by an increase in revenue in the HFS – South segment led\nby an increase in customer activity.\nSpecialty rental income consists primarily of revenues from leasing rooms and other facilities at certain communities that\ninclude contractual arrangements with customers that are considered leases under the authoritative accounting guidance for\nleases. Specialty rental income decreased primarily as a result of lower revenue in the Government segment from the decrease\nin the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from the prior\nExpanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023, partially by lower minimum lease revenue as well as\nlower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current period, and the termination of the STFRC\nContract.\nCost of services. Cost of services was $101.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $109.5\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in services costs is primarily due to a decrease in services costs in the Government segment driven by\noperational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the PCC Community,\nincluding lease terminations as a result of the purchase of certain previously leased equipment. Approximately $1 million of\nthis decrease was driven by a community in the All Other category that incurred lodge removal and transportation costs in the\nprior period that didn’t recur in the current period, while approximately $0.3 million of this decrease was driven by the\ntermination of the STFRC Contract. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $1.7 million in the\nHFS-South segment related to an increase in operational costs from community expansion to support increased customer\ndemand in the HFS-South segment, partially offset by the prior period including asset mobilization and integration costs\nassociated with a new community acquired in January 2023 that didn’t recur in the current period and operational efficiencies\nachieved in the current period.\nSpecialty rental costs. Specialty rental costs were $16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared\nto $23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in specialty rental costs is primarily due to a\ndecrease in costs from the Government segment driven by operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with\ncertain leases that were terminated at the PCC Community, termination of the STFRC Contract in the Government segment,\nand partially by operational efficiencies achieved in the current period in the HFS-South segment.\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets. Depreciation of specialty rental assets was $43.6 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to $53.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in\ndepreciation expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in depreciation on certain specialty rental assets and related\nleasehold improvements acquired or built in 2022 to support growth of the Government segment related to the contract that\noriginated in May of 2022 with the NP Partner, which became fully depreciated during the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwhile approximately $1.8 million of this decrease was driven by a decrease in depreciation of specialty rental assets in the\nHFS-South segment for certain assets that became fully depreciated during 2024.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative was $41.6 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to $43.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expense of $(2.3) million was primarily driven by a decrease in stock compensation expense of\napproximately $8.3 million led primarily by the liability-based stock appreciation right awards (“SARs”) driven by a lower\nnumber of SAR awards outstanding during the current period compared to the prior period as approximately 50% of such\nawards were outstanding as of September 30, 2023 compared to 0% in the current period as there are no remaining awards\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024 as these awards vested and were exercised as of September 30, 2024. Other corporate\ncosts (i.e. recruiting, market research, and outside services) also decreased by approximately $0.5 million from the prior\nperiod. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in severance of approximately $1 million for certain terminated\nemployees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other compensation and benefits cost increases of\napproximately $0.8 million, audit fee increases of approximately $0.4 million, other professional fee increases of\napproximately $0.5 million, insurance expense increase of approximately $0.3 million, and an increase in transaction fees of\napproximately $3.5 million associated with certain transactions, including primarily the Proposal described in “Recent\n42\nTable of Contents\nDevelopments” in Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form\n10-Q.\nOther depreciation and amortization. Other depreciation and amortization expense was $11.7 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 as compared to $11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other\ndepreciation and amortization is primarily driven by an increase in depreciation associated with an increase in finance leases\nfor commercial use vehicles.\nOther expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net was $(0.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nas compared to $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in expense is primarily driven by\ncosts incurred on the disposal of assets in the All Other segment category in the prior period, which didn’t recur in the current\nperiod.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as\ncompared to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt is\ndue to the partial redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on March 15, 2023, which was accounted for as a partial\nextinguishment of debt and resulted in a charge of approximately $1.7 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred\nfinancing costs and unamortized original issue discount. Approximately $0.4 million of the change related to the write-off of\nunamortized deferred financing costs for non-continuing lenders in connection with the First Amendment to the ABL Facility\non February 1, 2023. No such activity occurred in the current period.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was $12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\n$17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in interest expense, net was primarily driven by a\ndecrease in interest expense on the Senior Secured Notes of approximately $2.7 million driven by the lower outstanding debt\nbalance in the current period as approximately $153.1 million of the Senior Secured Notes were paid off during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Approximately $1.7 million of this decrease was driven by lower deferred financing cost amortization on\nthe Senior Secured Notes during the current period due to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the partial extinguishment of debt associated with the partial redemption of\nthe 2024 Senior Secured Notes on March 15, 2023 discussed above. Approximately $1.8 million of this decrease was driven\nby an increase in interest income earned on cash equivalents funded by the increase in available cash as a result of cash flows\nfrom operations. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Senior Secured Note original issue discount\namortization of approximately $0.9 million driven by fees incurred in connection with the Senior Note Exchange that closed\non November 1, 2023 as more fully discussed in Note 8 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere within this Form 10-Q. Additionally, these decreases were partially offset by an increase in ABL Facility\ndeferred financing costs amortization and unused line fee expenses combined of approximately $0.3 million driven by the\nABL Facility amendments completed in the prior year as more fully discussed in Note 8 of the notes to our unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q.\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities represents the fair value adjustments to\nthe outstanding Private Warrant liabilities based on the change in their estimated fair value at each reporting period end. The\nchange in fair value of the warrant liabilities was $(0.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\n$ (1.8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities is the\nresult of changes in market prices deriving the value of the financial instruments. The estimated value of the Private Warrants\ndecreased in the current period, generating an increase to income in the current period. There is also a lower number of\noutstanding Private Warrants in the current period compared to the prior period given the Private Warrants expired on March\n15, 2024 as discussed in Note 9 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this\nForm 10-Q.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense was $17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\n$40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to\nthe decrease in income before taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 led by a decrease in revenue, partially\noffset by cost decreases previously mentioned.\n43\nTable of Contents\nSegment Results\nThe following table sets forth our selected results of operations for each of our reportable segments and All Other for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 ($ in thousands, except for Average Daily Rate).\nPercentage\nFor the Three Months Ended Amount of Change\nSeptember 30, Increase Increase\n2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease)\nRevenue:\nGovernment $ 53,482 $ 105,541 $ (52,059) (49)%\nHFS - South 38,033 37,527 506 1%\nAll Other 3,676 2,871 805 28%\nTotal Revenues $ 95,191 $ 145,939 $ (50,748) (35)%\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nGovernment $ 46,280 $ 90,516 $ (44,236) (49)%\nHFS - South 12,334 14,078 (1,744) (12)%\nAll Other 653 (185) 838 (453)%\nTotal Adjusted Gross Profit $ 59,267 $ 104,409 $ (45,142) (43)%\nAverage Daily Rate\nHFS - South $ 72.96 $ 75.71 $ (2.75)\nNote: Adjusted gross profit for the chief operating decision maker’s (“CODM”) analysis includes the services and rental costs\nrecognized in the financial statements and excludes depreciation on specialty rental assets, certain severance costs, and loss\non impairment.

This was also partially driven by a decrease in revenue of approximately $3.5 million from the South\nTexas Family Residential Center led by the STFRC Contract termination as previously discussed.\nAdjusted gross profit decreased as a result of the decrease in revenue mentioned above, partially offset by lower costs due to\noperational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the PCC\n45\nTable of Contents\nCommunity, including lease terminations as a result of the purchase of certain previously leased equipment. This was also\npartially offset by a decrease in costs of approximately $1 million from the South Texas Family Residential Center led by the\nSTFRC Contract termination previously discussed.\nHFS – South\nRevenue for the HFS – South segment was $113.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to\n$112.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nAdjusted gross profit for the HFS – South segment was $38.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as\ncompared to $39.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase in revenue of $0.7 million was primarily attributable to an increase in customer activity, which led to more\ncommunities in operation during the current period, including a new community acquired in January 2023 to support growth\nin the HFS – South segment.\nThe decrease in adjusted gross profit of $ (0.8) million was primarily attributable to an increase in operational costs from\ncommunity expansion to support increased customer demand, partially offset by a decrease in service costs driven by the prior\nperiod including asset mobilization and integration costs associated with the new community acquired in January 2023 that\ndidn’t recur in the current period and by operational efficiencies achieved in the current period. The increase in revenue noted\nabove also partially offset this decrease.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe depend on cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our ABL Facility to finance our acquisition\nstrategy, working capital needs, and capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, the ABL Facility had unused available\nborrowing capacity of $175 million. We currently believe that our cash on hand, along with these sources of funds will\nprovide sufficient liquidity to fund debt service requirements, support our growth, acquisition, and diversification strategy\ndiscussed in Item 1, “Business” of the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K, lease obligations, contingent liabilities and working\ncapital investments for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain future debt\nor equity financings adequate for our future cash requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient, we may be forced to reduce or delay additional acquisitions, future\ninvestments and capital expenditures, and seek additional capital. Significant delays in our ability to finance planned\nacquisitions or capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects.\nWe continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that any such acquisition may require us to incur\nadditional debt to finance the acquisition and/or to issue shares of our Common Stock or other equity securities as acquisition\nconsideration or as part of an overall financing plan. We will continue to evaluate alternatives to optimize our capital structure,\nwhich could include the issuance or repurchase of unsecured and secured debt, equity securities and/or equity-linked\nsecurities. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance or repurchase. From time to time, we may also\nseek to streamline our capital structure and improve our financial position through refinancing or restructuring our existing\ndebt or retiring certain of our securities for cash or other consideration.\nCapital Requirements\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred approximately $28.1 million in capital expenditures, with\napproximately $14.3 million driven by capital expenditures in the Government segment. Maintenance capital expenditures for\nspecialty rental assets amounted to approximately $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As we pursue\ngrowth, we monitor which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to us to meet our future\nfinancial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. However, future cash flows are subject\nto a number of variables, including the ability to maintain existing contracts, obtain new contracts and manage our operating\nexpenses. The failure to achieve anticipated revenue and cash flows from operations could result in a\n46\nTable of Contents\nreduction in future capital spending. We cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on\nacceptable terms or at all. In the event we make additional acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the\namount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital\nexpenditures or seek additional capital. We cannot assure you that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at\nall.\nThe following table sets forth general information derived from our unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows:\nFor the Nine Months Ended\n($ in thousands) September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 121,123 $ 118,512\nNet cash used in investing activities (23,421) (60,909)\nNet cash used in financing activities (23,879) (134,177)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5) 5\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 73,818 $ (76,569)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nCash flows provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $121.1 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to $118.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe current period is up by approximately $2.6 million when compared to 2023 driven by an increase in cash collections from\ncustomers of approximately $2.5 million, and a net decrease in payments for operating expenses and payroll of approximately\n$9.7 million driven by a decrease of approximately $3.9 million in cash payments for the vested SAR awards, and by a\ndecrease in operating expenses led by the Government segment, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for severance, and\nan increase in cash paid for audit and other professional fees. There was also an increase in interest received by approximately\n$2.3 million (driven by a higher average outstanding cash balance in the current period that generated interest income), and a\ndecrease in cash paid for interest during the period of approximately $8.7 million driven by lower debt as a result of a decrease\nin the outstanding balance of the Senior Secured Notes. These increases in net cash flows from operations were partially offset\nby an increase in cash paid for income taxes of approximately $20.5 million as our United States federal tax loss carryforward\ndeductions were fully utilized during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCash flows used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $23.4 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to $60.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net cash used\nin investing activities was primarily related to a decrease in growth capital expenditures in the HFS – South segment with the\nlargest single driver being the $18.6 million acquisition of community assets and related intangibles in January 2023,\nsupporting continued customer demand. To a lesser extent, the decrease was related to a $5.0 million acquisition of\ncommunity assets in April 2023 and $1.3 million worth of land acquisitions during the three months ended September 30,\n2023, supporting Government segment growth. The remainder of the decrease was driven by a decrease in other growth\ncapital expenditures in the Government segment as the prior period included expansion related activities associated with the\nExpanded PCC Community contract that became effective on May 16, 2022 and drove a significant amount of capital\nexpenditure spend into 2023.\nCash flows used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $23.9 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to $134.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net cash\nused in financing activities was primarily driven by the $125 million partial redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on\nMarch 15, 2023 combined with the prior period including the payment of deferred financing costs of $1.4 million associated\nwith the ABL Facility amendment, payment of accrued issuance costs from the warrant exchange of $1.5 million that closed in\nDecember of 2022, and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of approximately $6.8 million, partially\noffset by the current period increase in net cash used in financing activities of approximately $21.9 million for the repurchase\nof Common Stock as part of the share repurchase program, combined with taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity\nawards of $2.6 million in the current period.\n47\nTable of Contents\nIndebtedness\nFinance lease and other financing obligations\nThe Company’s finance lease and other financing obligations as of September 30, 2024 consisted of approximately $2.5\nmillion of finance leases. The finance leases pertain to leases entered into during 2017 through September 30, 2024, for\ncommercial-use vehicles with 36-month terms (and continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter) expiring through 2027.\nThe Company’s finance lease and other financing obligations as of December 31, 2023 consisted of approximately $2.4\nmillion of finance leases related to commercial-use vehicles with the same terms as described above.\nABL Facility\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no amounts were drawn or repaid on the ABL Facility resulting in an\noutstanding balance of $0 as of September 30, 2024. The maturity date of the ABL Facility is February 1, 2028, which\nextended termination date is subject to a springing maturity that will accelerate the maturity of the ABL Facility if any of the\n2025 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding on the date that is ninety-one days prior to the stated maturity date thereof.\nRefer to Note 8 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q for\nadditional discussion of the ABL Facility.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn March 15, 2019, Arrow Bidco issued $340 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes under the\n2024 Notes Indenture by and among Arrow Bidco, the Note Guarantors, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as\ntrustee and as collateral agent. Interest was payable semi-annually on September 15 and March 15 and began September 15,\n2019. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made an elective repayment of approximately $5.5 million on\nthe 2024 Senior Secured Notes, reducing the principal balance outstanding to $334.5 million from an original principal\nbalance of $340 million. On March 15, 2023, Arrow Bidco redeemed $125 million in aggregate principal amount of the\noutstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes. In connection with the Notes Exchange Offer (as defined in the Company’s 2023\nForm 10-K), on November 1, 2023, approximately $181.4 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes were exchanged by Arrow\nBidco and Arrow Bidco issued approximately $181.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes\nunder the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture by and among Arrow Bidco, the guarantors from time to time party thereto\nand Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee and collateral agent. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15\nand September 15 of each year, and began on March 15, 2024. Following this issuance and related transactions, approximately\n$28.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes remained outstanding, which were subsequently\nredeemed on November 21, 2023 resulting in an outstanding balance of $0. As of September 30, 2024, none of the 2024\nSenior Secured Notes remain outstanding and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes had an outstanding principal balance of $181.4\nmillion. Refer to Note 8 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form\n10-Q for additional discussion of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Exchange Offer, and the 2025 Senior Secured\nNotes.\nCash requirements\nWe expect that our principal short-term (over the next 12 months) and long-term needs for cash relating to our operations and\nobligations will be to primarily fund (i) operating activities and working capital, (ii) maintenance and growth capital\nexpenditures for specialty rental and other property, plant, and equipment assets, (iii) payments due under finance and\noperating leases, (iv) principal payments on the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, and (v) debt service interest payments. We plan to\nfund such cash requirements from our existing sources of liquidity as previously discussed.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents information on payments coming due under the most significant categories of our needs for cash\n(excluding operating cash flows pertaining to normal business operations, other than operating lease obligations) as of\nSeptember 30, 2024:\n($ in thousands) Total Rest of 2024 2025 2026 2027\nInterest Payments(1) $ 14,629 $ — $ 14,629 $ — $ —\n2025 Senior Secured Notes 181,446 — 181,446 — —\nOperating lease obligations, including imputed interest(2) 14,634 2,889 6,254 4,274 1,217\nTotal $ 210,709 $ 2,889 $ 202,329 $ 4,274 $ 1,217\n(1) We will incur and pay interest expense at 10.75% of the remaining face value of $181.4 million annually in connection\nwith our 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Over the remaining term of the Notes, interest payments total approximately $14.6\nmillion.\n(2) Represents interest on operating lease obligations calculated using the appropriate discount rate for each lease.\nConcentration of Risks\nIn the normal course of business, we grant credit to customers based on credit evaluations of their financial condition and\ngenerally require no collateral or other security. Major customers are defined as those individually comprising more than 10%\nof our revenues or accounts receivable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had two customers, who\naccounted for 47% and 13% of revenues, respectively, while no other customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues.\nThe largest customers accounted for 31% and 10% of accounts receivable, respectively, while no other customers accounted\nfor more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2024.\nOur largest customer for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 accounted for 63% of revenues, while no other customer\naccounted for more than 10% of revenues. The largest customer accounted for 21% of accounts receivable, respectively, while\nno other customers accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2023.\nMajor suppliers are defined as those individually comprising more than 10% of the annual goods purchased by the Company.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had one major supplier representing 20% of goods purchased. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, we had one major supplier that represented 16.6% of goods purchased.\nWe provide services almost entirely to customers in the government and natural resource industries and as such, are almost\nentirely dependent upon the continued activity of such customers.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company leases certain land, buildings, offices, modular units, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases, the\nterms of which vary and generally contain renewal options. Such operating lease obligations are recognized in the Company’s\naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 as current portion of operating lease obligations and long-\nterm operating lease obligations. Refer to the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the amounts recognized as current portion of operating lease obligations and long-term\noperating lease obligations as of September 30, 2024.\nRent expense included in services costs in the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income for cancelable and\nnon-cancelable leases was $9.6 million and $18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Rent expense included in services costs in the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income for\ncancelable and non-cancelable leases was $2.9 million and $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. Rent expense included in the selling, general, and administrative expenses in the unaudited consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income for cancelable and non-cancelable leases was $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rent expense included in the selling, general, and administrative\nexpenses in the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income for cancelable\n49\nTable of Contents\nand non-cancelable leases was $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“US GAAP”).\nFor a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”\nsection in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 to the judgments, assumptions and estimates upon which our critical accounting estimates are\nbased.\nAdditionally, refer to Note 1 of our notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for\nadditional discussion of our summary of significant accounting policies and use of estimates. These estimates require\nsignificant judgments and assumptions.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nRefer to Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of\nprinciples of consolidation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for our assessment\nof recently issued accounting standards.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows which are measurements\nnot calculated in accordance with US GAAP, in the discussion of our financial results because they are key metrics used by\nmanagement to assess financial performance. Our business is capital-intensive and these additional metrics allow management\nto further evaluate our operating performance.\nTarget Hospitality defines Adjusted gross profit, as gross profit plus depreciation of specialty rental assets and loss on\nimpairment, and certain severance costs.\nTarget Hospitality defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt, income\ntax expense (benefit), depreciation of specialty rental assets, and other depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA reflects the following further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect of\nwhat management considers transactions or events not related to its core business operations:\n● Other expense (income), net: Other expense (income), net includes miscellaneous cash receipts, gains and losses on\ndisposals of property, plant, and equipment, and other immaterial expenses and non-cash items.\n● Transaction expenses: Target Hospitality incurred advisory fees associated with certain transactions during 2023.\nDuring 2024, Target Hospitality incurred expenses associated with certain transactions, primarily driven by the\nProposal described in “Recent Developments” in Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q.\n50\nTable of Contents\n● Stock-based compensation: Charges associated with stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will\ncontinue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our\ncompensation strategy.\n● Change in fair value of warrant liabilities: Non-cash change in estimated fair value of warrant liabilities.\n● Other adjustments: System implementation costs, including non-cash amortization of capitalized system\nimplementation costs, business development, accounting standard implementation costs and certain severance costs.\nWe define Discretionary cash flows as cash flows from operations less maintenance capital expenditures for specialty rental\nassets.\nEBITDA reflects net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for\nincome taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance\nbecause we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use\nEBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors, and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary\nwidely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be\ndependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on\nearnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing\nabilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result,\neffective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes\ndepreciation and amortization expense, because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different\nmethods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the\nrelative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\nTarget Hospitality also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted\nEBITDA reflects adjustments to exclude the effects of additional items, including certain items, that are not reflective of the\nongoing operating results of Target Hospitality. In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude gains or losses on the\nsale or disposal of depreciable assets and impairment losses because including them in EBITDA is inconsistent with reporting\nthe ongoing performance of our remaining assets. Additionally, the gain or loss on sale or disposal of depreciable assets and\nimpairment losses represents either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods, and depreciation is\nexcluded from EBITDA.\nTarget Hospitality also presents Discretionary cash flows because we believe it provides useful information regarding our\nbusiness as more fully described below. Discretionary cash flows indicate the amount of cash available after maintenance\ncapital expenditures for specialty rental assets for, among other things, investments in our existing business.\nAdjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows are not measurements of Target\nHospitality’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to gross profit, net income or\nother performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as\nmeasures of Target Hospitality’s liquidity. Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows\nshould not be considered as discretionary cash available to Target Hospitality to reinvest in the growth of our business or as\nmeasures of cash that is available to it to meet our obligations. In addition, the measurement of Adjusted gross profit,\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other\ncompanies. Target Hospitality’s management believes that Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and\nDiscretionary cash flows provides useful information to investors about Target Hospitality and its financial condition and\nresults of operations for the following reasons: (i) they are among the measures used by Target Hospitality’s management team\nto evaluate its operating performance; (ii) they are among the measures used by Target Hospitality’s management team to\nmake day-to-day operating decisions, (iii) they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties\nas a common performance measure to compare results across companies in Target Hospitality’s industry.\n51\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Target Hospitality’s consolidated gross profit to Adjusted gross profit:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\n($ in thousands) September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGross Profit $ 45,210 $ 86,756 $ 141,148 $ 251,085\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets 14,057 17,653 43,643 53,242\nAdjusted gross profit $ 59,267 $ 104,409 $ 184,791 $ 304,327\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Target Hospitality’s consolidated net income to EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\n($ in thousands) September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 20,094 $ 45,579 $ 58,863 $ 135,857\nIncome tax expense 4,084 14,608 17,118 40,528\nInterest expense, net 3,813 4,953 12,673 17,726\nLoss on extinguishment of debt — — — 2,128\nOther depreciation and amortization 3,902 3,838 11,695 11,482\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets 14,057 17,653 43,643 53,242\nEBITDA 45,950 86,631 143,992 260,963\nAdjustments\nOther expense (income), net (2) (71) (158) 1,244\nTransaction expenses 1,958 504 4,119 593\nStock-based compensation 1,600 4,835 5,683 13,948\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities — 2,576 (675) (1,809)\nOther adjustments 199 569 2,609 1,619\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 49,705 $ 95,044 $ 155,570 $ 276,558\n52\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Target Hospitality’s Net cash provided by operating activities to Discretionary\ncash flows:\nFor the Nine Months Ended\n($ in thousands) September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 121,123 $ 118,512\nLess: Maintenance capital expenditures for specialty rental assets (17,982) (10,725)\nDiscretionary cash flows $ 103,141 $ 107,787\nPurchase of specialty rental assets (23,638) (53,662)\nPurchase of property, plant and equipment (324) (2,941)\nAcquired intangible assets — (4,547)\nProceeds from sale of specialty rental assets and other property, plant and equipment 541 241\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (23,421) $ (60,909)\nPrincipal payments on finance and finance lease obligations (1,223) (1,037)\nRepayment of Senior Notes — (125,000)\nRepurchase of Common Stock (21,894) —\nPayment of issuance costs from warrant exchange — (1,504)\nProceeds from issuance of Common Stock from exercise of warrants 3 209\nProceeds from issuance of Common Stock from exercise of options 1,850 1,396\nPayment of deferred financing costs — (1,423)\nTaxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards (2,615) (6,818)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (23,879) $ (134,177)\n53\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nOur principal market risks are our exposure to interest rates and commodity risks.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk through our ABL Facility, which is subject to the risk of higher interest charges associated\nwith increases in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had $0 of outstanding floating-rate obligations under our credit\nfacilities. These floating-rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-\nterm interest rates. If floating interest rates increased by 100 basis points, our consolidated interest expense would not be\nimpacted, however, based on our floating-rate debt obligations, which had no outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024.\nCommodity Risk\nCommodity price fluctuations also indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term because they\nmay affect production rates and investments by natural resource development companies in the development of commodity\nreserves.\nWe have limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices. However, both our profitability and\nour cash flows are affected by volatility in commodity prices. We do not currently hedge our exposure to commodity prices.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s management, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the\nExchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nrules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s management and our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the\nreasonable assurance level.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, the majority of which arise out of the ordinary course of\nbusiness. The nature of the Company’s business is such that disputes occasionally arise with vendors including suppliers and\nsubcontractors, and customers over contract specifications and contract interpretations among other things. The company\nassesses these matters on a case-by-case basis as they arise. Reserves are established, as required, based on its assessment of\nexposure. We have insurance policies to cover general liability and workers’ compensation-related claims. In the opinion of\nmanagement, the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under such pending lawsuits, claims and legal\nproceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Because litigation is\nsubject to inherent uncertainties including unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of\nour legal proceedings could involve amounts that are different from our currently recorded accruals, and that such differences\ncould be material.\n54\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not\nexclusively within the Company’s control and which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or\nprojected future performance. “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2023 Form 10-K includes a discussion of our risk factors. The\ninformation presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our\n2023 Form 10-K. Except as presented below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our 2023\nForm 10-K.\nWe depend on our most significant customer. The loss of our largest customer, or any one of our largest customers in any\nof our business segments, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of the previously announced termination of the contract for the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley,\nTexas, we depend on our most significant customer. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our largest customer\naccounted for approximately 47% of our total revenue, and our five largest customers accounted for approximately 75% of our\ntotal revenue. For a more detailed explanation of our customers, see the “Item 1. Business” of our 2023 Form 10-K. The loss\nof our largest customer or any one of our largest customers in any of our business segments or a sustained decrease in demand\nby any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results\nof operations.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nThe Company did not sell any securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that were not registered under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\").\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes the Company\nto repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock. The stock repurchase program does not obligate\nthe Company to purchase any particular number of shares, and the timing and exact amount of any repurchases will depend on\nvarious factors, including market pricing and conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations, and other\nfactors. Any shares of common stock repurchased will be held as treasury shares.\nThe Company may repurchase its shares in open market transactions from time to time or through privately negotiated\ntransactions in accordance with federal securities laws, at the Company's discretion. The repurchase program, which has no\nexpiration date, may be increased, suspended, or terminated at any time. The program is expected to be implemented over the\ncourse of several years and is conducted subject to the covenants in the agreements governing the Company's indebtedness.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 2,424,440 shares of Common Stock for an\naggregated price of approximately $22.3 million (exclusive of estimated excise taxes of approximately $0.1 million). During\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 150,000 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate\nprice of approximately $1.1 million (exclusive of estimated excise taxes of less than $0.1 million). As of September 30, 2024,\nthe stock repurchase program had a remaining capacity of approximately $77.7 million.\nThe following table summarizes all of the share repurchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nTotal number of\nshares purchased Maximum number of\nas part of publicly shares yet to be\nTotal number of Average price announced plan or purchased under the\nPeriod shares paid per share program plan (1)\nJanuary 1, 2024 through January 31, 2024 903,444 $ 9.37 903,444 9,465,382\nFebruary 1, 2024 through February 29, 2024 754,556 $ 9.47 754,556 8,717,615\nMarch 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024 616,440 $ 8.89 616,440 7,259,287\nSeptember 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 150,000 $ 7.61 150,000 9,995,668\nTotal 2,424,440 2,424,440\n55\nTable of Contents\n(1) The maximum number of shares that may be repurchased under the stock repurchase program is calculated by dividing\nthe total dollar amount available to repurchase shares by the closing price of our Common Stock on the last business day\nof the respective month.\nItem 3.

This makes us an\nintegral part of the planning and execution phases for all customers.\nWe provide a safe, comfortable, and healthy environment to our guests, employees and workers across the U.S. and\nanywhere our customers need our facilities and services. Under our “Target 12” service model, we provide benefits to our\ncustomers, delivering high quality food, rest, connection, wellness, community, and hospitality, which optimizes our\ncustomers’ workforce engagement, performance, safety, loyalty, and productivity during work hours.\nThis facility and service model is provided directly by our employees, who deliver the essential services 24 hours per\nday for 365 days a year. We provide all of the hospitality services at our sites, and as a result, we believe we deliver\nmore consistent and high-quality hospitality services at each community compared to our peers. Our company and\nemployees are driven by our primary objective of helping our customers’ workforce reach their full potential every\nday. Our professionally trained hospitality staff has the unique opportunity to live with our customers as most of our\nemployees live on location at the communities where our customers’ workforce reside. This allows our employees to\ndevelop powerful customer empathy, so we are better able to deliver consistent service quality and care through the Target\n12 platform each day. Our employees are focused on the “other 12 hours”—the time our customers and their\n4\nemployees are not working—making sure we deliver a well fed, well rested, happier, loyal, safer and more productive\nemployee every day. What we provide our customers’ workforce “off the clock” optimizes their performance when they\nare “on the clock.” The investment our customers make in their employees the “other 12 hours” is an essential part of their\nstrategy and overall business and operations execution plan.\nUsing our expansive community network, unique core competencies and full-service turnkey hospitality solutions, we\nprovide critical facilities and hospitality support services for fully integrated natural resource development companies and\ncontractors of the United States Government. Our assets are well-suited to support the full lifecycle of development plans\nand we are able to scale our facility size to meet customers’ growing needs. We are well-positioned to continue serving\nour customers throughout the full cycle of their projects, which typically last for several decades. Our integrated model\nprovides value to our customers by reducing project timing and counterparty risks associated with projects. More broadly,\nour accommodations networks, combined with our integrated value-added hospitality and facilities services creates value\nfor our customers by optimizing their engagement, performance, safety, loyalty, productivity, preparedness and\nprofitability.\nSummary of Value-Added Services\nWe take great pride in the premium customer experience we offer across our range of community and hospitality services\nofferings. The majority of Target’s communities include in-house culinary and hospitality services. Our world-class\nculinary and catering professionals serve approximately 16,000,000 meals on average each year with fresh ingredients and\nmany of our meals are made from scratch. We self-manage most culinary and hospitality services, which provides us with\ngreater control over service quality as well as incremental revenue and profit potential. Our communities are designed to\npromote rest and quality of life for our customers’ workforces and include amenities such as:\nSummary of Amenities at various Communities:\n● Innovative Modular Design ● On-site Commissary\n● Single Occupancy Design ● Media Lounges and WIFI Throughout\n● Swimming Pool, Volleyball, Basketball courts ● Flat-Screen TVs in Each Room\n● Commercial Kitchen ● 40+ Premium TV Channel Line-up\n● Fast Food Lounges ● Personal Laundry Service\n● Full & Self Service Dining Areas ● Individually Controlled HVAC System\n● TV Sport/Entertainment Lounges ● Hotel Access Lock Systems\n● Training/conference Rooms ● 24 Hour No-Limit Dining\n● Core Passive Recreation Areas ● Self Dispensing Laundry\n● Active Fitness Centers ● Commercial Laundry\n● Lodge Recreation Areas ● Transportation to Project Site\n● Locker/Storage/Boot-up Areas ● 24 Hour Gated Security\n● Parking Areas ● Daily Cleaning & Custodial Service\n● Waste Water Treatment Facility ● Professional Uniformed Staff\nOur hospitality services and programming are designed to promote safety, security and rest, which in turn promote greater\non-the-job productivity for our customers’ workforces. Our communities strictly adhere to our community code of conduct,\nwhich, among other things, prohibits drugs, illegal firearms, co-habitation and guests. We work closely with our customers\nto ensure that our communities are an extension of the safe environment and culture they aim to provide to their employees\nwhile they are on a project location. Our community code of conduct is adopted by each corporate customer and enforced\nin conjunction with our customers through their documented health, safety and environmental policies, standards and\ncustomer management. We recognize that safety and security extends beyond the customers’ jobsite and is a 24-hour\nresponsibility which requires 24-hour services by Target Hospitality in close collaboration with our customers.\n5\nHistory and Development\nTarget Hospitality’s legacy businesses have grown and developed since they were created.

Our industry divides\nspecialty rental accommodations into three primary types: communities, temporary worker lodges and mobile assets. We\nare principally focused on communities across several end markets, including natural resource development, and the U.S.\ngovernment.\n6\nCommunities typically contain a larger number of rooms and require more time and capital to develop. These facilities\ntypically have commercial kitchens, dining areas, conference rooms, medical and dental services, recreational facilities,\nmedia lounges and landscaped grounds where climate permits. A portion of our communities are built and underpinned\nby multi-year committed contracts which often include exclusivity provisions. These facilities are designed to serve the\nlong-term needs of customers regardless of the end markets they serve. Our communities provide fully-integrated and\nvalue-added hospitality services, including but not limited to: catering and food services, housekeeping, health and\nrecreation facilities, laundry services and overall workforce community management, as well as water and wastewater\ntreatment, power generation, communications and personnel logistics where required. In contrast, temporary lodges are\nusually smaller in number of rooms and generally do not include hospitality, catering, facilities services or other value-\nadded on-site services and typically serve customers on a spot or short-term basis without long-term committed contracts.\nThese temporary facilities are “open” for any customer who needs lodging services. Finally, mobile assets, or rig housing,\nare designed to follow customers’ activities and are generally used for drilling rig operators. They are often used to support\nconventional drilling crews and are contracted on a project-by-project or short-term basis.\nOur specialty rental modular assets and hospitality services deliver the essential services and accommodations when and\nwhere there is a lack of sufficient accessible or cost-effective housing, infrastructure or local labor. Many of the geographic\nareas near the southern U.S. border lack sufficient temporary housing and infrastructure for asylum-seeking immigrants\nor may require additional infrastructure in the future. In the U.S. natural resource development industry, many of the\nlargest hydrocarbon reservoirs are in remote and expansive geographic locations, like the Southwestern portion of the\nUnited States and North Dakota where limited infrastructure exists. We support the development of these necessary natural\nresources by providing the fully-integrated and value-added hospitality services described above. Our communities and\nintegrated hospitality services allow our customers to outsource their accommodations needs to a single provider,\noptimizing employee morale, productivity, safety, and loyalty while focusing their investment on their core businesses and\nlong term planning.\nThe communities we own, operate, or manage, as well as those facilities we own but are managed by other operators, are\nsubject to competition for residents from other private operators. We compete primarily on location, cost, the quality and\nrange of services offered, our experience in the design, construction, and management of facilities, and our reputation. We\ncompete with government agencies that are responsible for residential facilities. Government sector demand for facilities\nis affected by a number of factors, including the demand for beds, general economic conditions and the size of the\npopulations needing these services.\nDemand for accommodations and related services within the natural resource development end market is influenced by\nfour primary factors: (i) available infrastructure, (ii) competition, (iii) workforce requirements, and (iv) capital spending.\nAnticipated capital spending, and our customers’ expectations for future capital spending as well as larger infrastructure\nrequirements, influence customers’ development on current productive assets, maintenance on current assets, expansion\nof existing assets and development of greenfield, brownfield or new assets. In addition to capital requirements, different\ntypes of customer activity require varying workforce sizes, influencing the demand for accommodations. Also, competing\nlocations and services influence demand for our assets and services.\nDemand within our government end market is primarily influenced by immigration, including the ongoing need to\naccommodate asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors as well as federal governmental policy and budgets. Continued\nincreases in immigration activity have influenced government spending on infrastructure in immigration-impacted regions,\nand, consequentially, demand for accommodations and related services.\nAnother factor that influences demand for our rooms and services is the type of customer we are supporting. Generally,\nnatural resource development customers require larger workforces during construction and expansionary periods and\ntherefore have a higher demand for accommodations. Due to the contiguous nature of their land positions, a “hub and\nspoke” model is utilized. Customers that support natural resource development also require larger and more mobile\nworkforces which, in many cases, consist of employees sourced from outside of the work areas. These employees,\n7\ndescribed as rotational workers, permanently reside in another region or state and commute to the regions served by our\nHFS–South segment on a rotational basis (often, two weeks on and one week off).\nIn addition, proximity to customer activities influences occupancy and demand. We have built, own and operate the two\nlargest specialty rental and hospitality services networks available to customers operating in the regions served by our\nHFS–South segment. These networks allow our customers to utilize one provider across a large and expansive geographic\narea. Our broad network often results in us having communities that are the closest to our customers’ job sites, which\nreduces commute times and costs, and improves the overall safety of our customers’ workforce.\nGenerally, if a community is within a one hour drive of a customer’s work location, our contractual exclusivity provisions\nwith our customers require the customers to have their workforce lodge at one of our communities. Our communities\nprovide customers with cost efficiencies, as they are able to jointly use our communities and related infrastructure (power,\nwater, sewer and IT) services alongside other customers operating in the same vicinity.\nDemand for our services is dependent upon activity levels, particularly our customers’ capital spending on natural resource\ndevelopment activities and government housing programs. Our customers’ spending plans generally are based on their\nview of commodity supply and demand dynamics, as well as the outlook for their medium and long-term commodity\nprices and annual government appropriations. Our current footprint supporting natural resource development customers is\nstrategically concentrated in the southwestern portion of the United States near the Permian Basin region served by our\nHFS–South segment. The Permian stretches across the southeast corner of New Mexico and through a large portion of\nland in western Texas, encompassing approximately a hundred thousand square miles and dozens of counties and is the\nlowest cost basin in the U.S., providing the most economic natural resource development inventory.\nBusiness Strengths & Strategies\nStrengths\n• Market Leader in Strategically Located Geographies. We are one of North America’s largest providers\nof turnkey specialty rental units with premium catering and hospitality services including 28 strategically\nlocated communities with approximately 16,800 beds primarily in the highest demand regions of the\nsouthwestern United States. Utilizing our large network of communities with the most bed capacity,\nparticularly within the regions served by our Government and HFS–South segments, we believe we are\nthe only provider with the scale and regional density to serve all of our customers’ needs in these key\nareas. Additionally, our network and relocatable facility assets allow us to transfer the rental fleet to\nlocations that meet our customer service needs across our segments allowing us to achieve a higher return\non capital. We leverage our scale and experience to deliver a comprehensive service offering of vertically\nintegrated accommodations and hospitality services that provides a compelling economic value\nproposition to our customers.\n• Long-Standing Relationships with Diversified Large Integrated Customers. We have long standing\nrelationships with our diversified base of approximately 290 customers, which includes some of the\nlargest blue-chip, investment grade natural resource development and integrated infrastructure\ncompanies in North America. We believe we have also established strong relationships in our U.S.\ngovernment end market with our contract partners and the federal agencies we serve. We initially won\nour large government sub-contract in 2014 based upon our differentiated ability to develop and open a\npermanent large-scale facility on an accelerated timeline. This contract was renewed and extended in\n2016 and 2020, demonstrating our successful execution and customer satisfaction. The relationships we\nhave established over the past decade have been built on trust and credibility given our track record of\nperformance and delivering value to our customers by providing a broad range of hospitality service\nofferings within a community atmosphere. Target’s customers’ willingness to enter into multi-year\n8\ncommitted contracts, and our historical client retainment rate of over 90%, demonstrates the strength of\nthese long-standing relationships.\n• Committed Revenue and Exclusivity Produce Highly Visible, Recurring Revenue. The vast majority of\nour revenues are generated under multi-year contracts that include committed payment terms or\nexclusivity provisions, under which our customers agree to use our network for all their accommodation\nneeds within the geographies we serve. In 2023, approximately 73% of our revenues had committed\npayment provisions and approximately 99% were under contract, including exclusivity. The weighted\naverage length of our contracts is approximately 45 months and we have maintained a consistent client\nrenewal rate of over 90% for the last 5 years. Our customers enter into long-term agreements and\nconsistently renew their contracts to ensure that sufficient accommodations and hospitality services are\nin place to properly care for their large workforces. Our multi-year contracts and consistent renewal rates\nprovide recurring revenue and high visibility on future financial performance.\n• Proven Performance and Resiliency Through the Various Economic Cycles. Our business model is\ngenerally well insulated from economic cycles. For example, we secured a major new contract in\nNovember 2023 for the continued operation of the humanitarian community in Pecos, Texas as well as\na renewal and extension in 2020 for another contract, each under our Government Segment which\ntogether represents approximately 72% of Target Hospitality’s 2023 revenue. Additionally, we utilize\nthe same asset base across our operating segments, which allows us to efficiently optimize our modular\nassets and redeploy them, as warranted by customer demand.\n• Long-lived Assets Requiring Minimal Maintenance Capital Expenditures. Our long-lived specialty\nrental assets support robust cash flow generation. Our rental assets have an average life of approximately\n15 years, and we typically recover our initial investment within the first few years of initial capital\ndeployment. Our maintenance capital between 2019 and 2023 has ranged from approximately 0.4% to\n4.0% of annual revenue with an average of 2% of annual revenue. We maintain low maintenance capital\nexpenditures, as cleaning and routine maintenance costs are included in day-to-day operating costs and\nrecovered through the average daily rates that we charge our customers. This continual care of our assets\nsupports extended asset lives and the ongoing ability to operate with only nominal maintenance capital\nexpenditures. The investment profile of our rental assets underpins our industry leading unit economics.\nOur contract discipline underpins our investment decision making and any spending on new growth\ninvestments is underwritten by contracts, with no speculative building. Generally, we do not invest\ncapital unless we expect to meet our internal return thresholds. Due to the high revenue visibility from\nlong-term contracts, we are poised to generate robust and stable cash flows driven by historical strategic\ngrowth investments and minimal future maintenance capital expenditure requirements.\nStrategies\nWe believe that we can further develop our business by, among other things:\n• Expansion and Diversification Through Acquisitions, Diversifying Our Service Offerings as well as our\nCustomer base. We selectively pursue acquisitions and business combinations related to specialty rental\nand hospitality services in the markets we currently serve as well as adjacent markets that offer existing\ncomplimentary services to ours. Leveraging our core competencies related to facilities management,\nculinary services, catering and site services, we believe that we can further scale these elements of our\nbusiness and replicate it in other geographies and end markets. We continue to focus on strengthening\nour balance sheet through strong cash flow generation and debt reduction to provide flexibility to execute\nupon targeted acquisitions and business combinations that would be accretive to us while also\ndiversifying our customer base, reducing customer concentration, and expanding our end markets.\n9\n• Maintaining and Expanding Existing Customer Relationships. Growing and maintaining key customer\nrelationships is a strategic priority. We fill existing bed capacity within our communities, while\noptimizing our inventory for existing customer expansion or for new customers. Keeping this balance\nprovides us with flexibility and a competitive advantage when pursuing new contract opportunities as\ntop-tier customers find enhanced value in the scale and flexibility of Target’s world class network, which\nsupports their comprehensive and dynamic housing and food management requirements. With the scale\nof our accommodations network, a significant number of our key customers are commercially exclusive\nto Target Hospitality as their primary and preferred provider of accommodations and hospitality services\nthroughout the U.S. or for a designated geographic area.\n• Enhancing Contract Scope and Services. One of our strategic focus areas is to enhance the scope and\nterms of our customer contracts. We intend to continue our historical track record of renewing and\nextending these contracts at favorable commercial and economic terms, while also providing additional\nvalue added services to our customers. For example, we have expanded our presence across multiple\ngovernment agencies creating broad reaching opportunities to extend reach beyond our core\naccommodations platform. Intentionally growing revenue in an attractive government services end\nmarket, allowed us to high-grade contracts and significantly expand Target’s growth pipeline.\n• Disciplined Growth Capital Expenditures to Increase Capacity. We selectively pursue opportunities to\nexpand existing communities and develop new communities to satisfy customer demand. We employ\nrigorous discipline to our capital expenditures to grow our business. Our investment strategy is generally\nto only deploy new capital with visibility—typically a contract—to revenue and returns to meet our\ninternal return hurdles often with capital recovery mechanisms. We target high returns on invested capital\nand achieve these returns due to our high cash-on-cash margin profile.\n• Growing and Pursuing New Customer/Contract Opportunities. We continually seek additional\nopportunities to lease our facilities to government, natural resource development, and other third-party\nowners or operators in need of specialty rental and hospitality services. We have a proven track record\nof success in executing our specialty rental and facilities management model across several end markets\nfor ongoing needs as well as major projects that have finite project life cycle durations. A strong national\npresence creates a platform to expand geographical reach into a wide range of industry applications,\nwhile significantly expanding Target’s long-term growth pipeline by utilizing existing core competencies\nto broaden service offerings across a variety of business and commercial applications. While special\nprojects do not constitute a large portion of our business, it is typical for us to secure some special projects\nthat can last anywhere from 1-5 years (or more). We have designated sales-related resources that focus\non special finite life cycle projects and maintain a dynamic business pipeline which includes but is not\nlimited to special projects across end markets.\n• Enhance Financial Strength and Create Shareholder Value. The Company follows a disciplined\napproach to maintaining and enhancing financial strength to create shareholder value. This strategy is\ncentered on the Company’s ability to drive profitable growth, and maximize net earnings, cash flows and\noperating margins; maintain consistent financial policies to ensure a strong balance sheet, liquidity level\nand access to capital; and retain the financial flexibility needed to strategically allocate and deploy capital\nas circumstances change. The Company’s disciplined financial approach also allows it to maintain\nsufficient liquidity and to reduce refinancing risk, with the nearest significant debt maturity of\n$181.4 million occurring in June 2025 consisting of our approximately $181.4 million in aggregate\nprincipal amount of 10.75% senior secured notes due June 15, 2025 (the “2025 Senior Secured Notes”).\nThe Company had total liquidity of approximately $278.9 million as of December 31, 2023, which\nconsisted of up to $175 million of unused capacity under its ABL Facility, and cash and cash equivalents\nof $103.9 million. This also further enhances the Company’s financial flexibility to allow for, among\nother things, executing the Company’s diversification strategy.\n10\nBusiness Operations\nTarget Hospitality provides specialty rental and hospitality services, temporary specialty rental and hospitality services\nsolutions and facilities management services across North America. The Company’s primary customers are U.S.\nGovernment related contractors, investment grade natural resource development companies and other workforce\naccommodation providers operating in the regions served by our HFS–South segment. The Company’s specialty rental\nand hospitality and management services are highly customizable and are tailored to each customer’s needs and\nrequirements. Target Hospitality is also an approved U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”) contract holder and\noffers a comprehensive range of housing, deployment, operations and management services through its GSA professional\nservices schedule agreement. The GSA contract allows U.S. federal agencies to acquire our products and services directly\nfrom Target Hospitality which expedites the commercial procurement process often required by government agencies.\nTarget Hospitality operates its business in two key end markets: (i) government (“Government”), which includes the\nfacilities, services and operations of (a) the family residential center and the related support communities in Dilley, Texas\n(the “South Texas Family Residential Center”) provided pursuant to its lease and services agreement with a national\nprovider of migrant programming; and (b) several facilities in West, Texas provided pursuant to its lease and services\nagreement with a leading national nonprofit organization (“NP Partner”) in support of their humanitarian aid efforts, both\nlocations backed by committed United States Government contracts; and (ii) HFS–South, which includes the facilities and\noperations in sixteen communities located across Texas and New Mexico.\nThe map below shows the Company’s primary community locations in the HFS–South segment (including five locations\noutside of this segment).\nCopyright ©2023 Whiskey Texas, LLC.

Residential facilities, including the South Texas Family Residential Center (discussed\nbelow), provide space and residential services in an open and safe environment. Residential facilities offer\nservices including, but not limited to, educational programs, medical care, recreational activities, counseling, and\naccess to religious and legal services.\n• Humanitarian Aid Efforts. Community facilities providing a suite of comprehensive service offerings supporting\nhumanitarian aid efforts.\nTarget Hospitality built and currently leases and operates the South Texas Family Residential Center through a sub-lease\nand services agreement with a national provider of migrant programming, which provides management services. Target\nHospitality owns the facility and provides select on-site services including catering, culinary, management, janitorial and\nlight maintenance. The South Texas Family Residential Center includes 524,000 square feet of building space including\nresidential housing units with 2,400 beds, as well as classrooms, a library, chapels, an infirmary with full medical, dental,\npharmaceutical and x-ray capabilities, a dining hall, offices and an industrial laundry center.\n12\nIn March 2021, the Company entered into a lease and services agreement with our NP Partner, backed by a committed\nUnited States Government contract, to provide a suite of comprehensive service offerings in support of their humanitarian\naid efforts at a residential housing facility. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company executed a new\ncontract with our NP Partner that became effective on May 16, 2022, which represented a significantly expanded lease\nand services agreement (“Expanded Humanitarian Contract”) to provide enhanced infrastructure and comprehensive\nfacility services that support the critical hospitality solutions the Company provides to the NP Partner and the U.S.\nGovernment in their humanitarian aid missions. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a significant scope\nexpansion and term extension for the continuation of services provided under the agreement that originated in March 2021\nwith approximately 6,375 beds. On May 15, 2023, the Company executed a six-month extension of the Expanded\nHumanitarian Contract, which extended the period of performance through November 15, 2023 and increased the contract\nvalue, with no change to contract structure or any other existing economic terms. During the year ended December 31,\n2023, the Company executed a new contract with our NP Partner (“New PCC Contract”), pursuant to an Indefinite\nDelivery, Indefinite Quantity Task Order between our NP Partner and the U.S. Government, that became effective on\nNovember 16, 2023, with a one year base period through November 15, 2024, with an option to extend for up to four\nadditional one year periods and an option to extend for up to six months upon the conclusion of the base period or any of\nthe option periods. Under the New PCC Contract, the Company will maintain similar facility size and operational scope\ncompared to the previous contract that became effective on May 16, 2022. The New PCC Contract operates with similar\nstructure to the Company’s existing and prior government services subcontracts, which are centered around minimum\nrevenue commitments supported by the United States Government. Additionally, the New PCC Contract includes\noccupancy-based variable services revenue that will align with active community population. This ongoing partnership is\nconsistent with our Government segment and strategy of diversifying end-markets through high quality contracts with\npremier partners that provide strong revenue visibility and cash flows.\nWe look forward to expanding the products and services of our Government segment through our GSA designations,\nspecifically our designation to maintain the professional services schedule (“PSS”) for logistics service solutions, which\nare designed to assist federal agencies in procuring comprehensive logistics solutions, including planning, consulting,\nmanagement, and operational support when deploying supplies, equipment, materials and associated personnel. GSA’s\nPSS is a multiple award schedule (“MAS”) contract for innovative solutions, offered to federal, state and local\ngovernments, for their professional service’s needs. Having a PSS signifies that we have been vetted as a responsible\nsupplier, our pricing has been determined to be fair and reasonable and we are in compliance with all applicable laws and\nregulations. PSS is one of the GSA’s schedule contracts, which are indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”), long-\nterm contracts under the GSA MAS program. GSA schedule contracts were developed to assist federal employees in\npurchasing products and services and they contain pre-negotiated prices, delivery terms, warranties, and other terms and\nconditions which streamline the buying process.\nThe Government segment generated approximately 72% or $403.7 million of the Company’s revenue for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The map below shows the Company’s primary community locations in the Government segment.\n13\nTEXAS\nCopyright ©2023 Whiskey Texas, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Confidential.\nHospitality & Facilities Services–South\nThe HFS–South segment serves an area that stretches across the southeast corner of New Mexico and a large portion of\nwestern Texas, encompassing approximately a hundred thousand square miles and dozens of counties. This geographic\narea, also known as the Permian Basin, is one of the world’s oldest natural resource producing regions. Our customers\nutilize both unconventional and conventional development techniques, encompassing multiple stacked development zones,\nwhich increases the potential recoverable resource and lengthens their development lifecycle.\nWhile understanding the significant economic potential in this region, Target entered the market in 2012, ahead of many\nof our competitors. We started in HFS–South with an 80-bed community in Pecos, TX.\nAs of December 31, 2023, with 16 communities and approximately 7,900 beds across HFS–South, we offer the largest\nnetwork of turnkey specialty rental accommodations and hospitality services.\nThe HFS–South segment generated approximately 26% or $148.7 million of the Company’s revenue for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The map below shows the Company’s primary community locations in the HFS–South region.\n14\nCopyright ©2023 Whiskey Texas, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had one customer, who accounted for approximately\n62% of our revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had two customers, who accounted for approximately 61% and 11% of our\nrevenue, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had two customers, who accounted for approximately 35% and 19% of our\nrevenue, respectively.\nGenerally, the Company competes based on factors including quality and breadth of available locations and room\nutilization, modular construction time and development expertise, proactive logistics management, geographic areas\nserviced, average daily rate, facility quality, and food management.\nThe accommodation facilities market in our HFS business is segmented into competitors that serve components of the\noverall value chain, but very few offer the entire suite of hospitality services to our customers. Our HFS competitors\nprimarily include small, independent businesses with a few locations, often with little to no contracts and with significantly\nfewer rooms, or RV parks that offer no turn-key services or modular accommodation solutions.\nThe accommodations market within our government business is generally segmented into competitors that primarily serve\nas temporary facilities with seasonal contracts, and tent providers with limited scale and services. U.S. Government sites\n16\ntypically do not own and operate the full suite of hospitality solutions, but contract out to third-parties for more limited\nofferings and on a shorter-term basis.\nThe Company’s Community and Services Contracts\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue related to the HFS–South segment represented approximately 26% of our\nrevenue, revenue related to our Government segment represented 72% of our revenue, and All Other revenue represented\n2% of our revenue.\nLease and Services Agreements\nThe Company’s operations in the HFS–South segment are conducted through several different types of agreements with\ncustomers.\nCertain customer agreements include committed contractual revenue arrangements, some of which contain minimum\nrevenue commitments. For certain of the Company’s customers, it uses network lease and services agreements (“NLSAs”)\nwhich cover the customer’s full enterprise and are exclusive agreements with set terms and rates for all geographic regions\nin which the Company operates. The NLSAs obligate the customers to use the Company’s facilities and services across\nthe U.S. The Company’s NLSAs have an average set term of two to three years.\nCertain other customers are subject to lease and services agreements (“LSAs”) which are more limited in geographic scope\nand cover only specified areas with the same structural commercial terms as the NLSAs. The LSAs obligate customers to\npay for a fixed amount of rooms over a term regardless of occupancy with terms that can range from one month to multiple\nyears. LSAs generally do not have termination provisions in favor of the customer.\nThe Company also has master services agreements (“MSAs”) with certain customers which are typically exclusive\narrangements without the committed component of the NLSAs and LSAs and no minimum contractual liability for the\ncustomer. MSAs make up the largest portion of the Company’s operations in the HFS–South segment.\nThe Company’s operations in the Government segment includes the South Texas Family Residential Center pursuant to a\ncontractual arrangement (the “Family Residential Center Contract” or “FRCC”) with a national provider of migrant\nprogramming (the “FRCC Partner”). This FRCC provides for the Company’s sublease and ongoing operation of the South\nTexas Family Residential Center through September 2026.\nOur FRCC Partner depends on the U.S. government and its funding. Any impasse or delay in reaching a federal budget\nagreement, debt ceiling or government shutdowns, and the subsequent lack of funding to the applicable government entity,\ncould result in material payment delays, payment reductions or contract terminations. The government may terminate the\ncontract with our FRCC Partner for convenience on 60 days’ notice; in the event this should occur, our FRCC Partner may\nterminate its agreement with us upon 60 days’ notice.\nThe Company also operates several facilities in connection with a lease and services agreement with the NP Partner,\nbacked by a committed United States Government contract, to provide a suite of comprehensive service offerings\nin support of their humanitarian aid efforts. The initial contract, including subsequent change orders and amendments, had\na value of approximately $129 million and was fully committed over its initial one-year term, which commenced\nMarch 18, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company executed the Expanded Humanitarian Contract\nwith our NP Partner that became effective on May 16, 2022, which represented a significantly expanded lease and services\nagreement to provide enhanced infrastructure and comprehensive facility services supporting the NP Partner and the\nU.S. Government in their humanitarian aid missions. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a significant\nscope expansion and term extension for the continuation of services provided under the agreement that originated in\nMarch 2021. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract operated with similar structure to the Company’s prior\n17\nand existing government services subcontracts, which are centered around minimum revenue commitments supported by\nthe United States Government. Additionally, the Expanded Humanitarian Contract included occupancy-based variable\nservices revenue that aligned with active community population. The minimum revenue commitments, which consisted of\nannual recurring lease revenue and nonrecurring infrastructure enhancement revenue, provided for a minimum annual\nrevenue contribution of approximately $390 million and was fully committed over its initial contract term. Inclusive of all\npotential occupancy-based variable services revenue, the Expanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a maximum initial\nannual total contract amount of approximately $575 million. On May 15, 2023, the Company executed a six-month\nextension of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract, which extended the period of performance through November 15, 2023\nand increased the contract value, with no change to contract structure or any other existing economic terms. The Expanded\nHumanitarian Contract terminated as of November 15, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company\nexecuted the New PCC Contract, pursuant to an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Task Order between our NP\nPartner and the United States Government, that replaced the Expanded Humanitarian Contract and became effective on\nNovember 16, 2023. The New PCC Contract includes a one year base period through November 15, 2024, an option to\nextend for up to four additional one year periods, and an option to extend for up to six months upon the conclusion of the\nbase period or any of the option periods. Under the New PCC Contract, the Company will maintain similar facility size\nand operational scope compared to the Expanded Humanitarian Contract. The New PCC Contract operates with similar\nstructure to the Company’s prior and existing government services subcontracts, which are centered around minimum\nrevenue commitments supported by the United States Government. Additionally, the New PCC Contract includes\noccupancy-based variable services revenue that will align with active community population. The minimum revenue\ncommitments, which consist of annual recurring lease revenue, provide for a minimum annual revenue contribution of\napproximately $178 million. Assuming all option periods are exercised, the 5-year cumulative minimum revenue\ncommitment of the New PCC Contract is expected to be approximately $892 million through 2028. Inclusive of the\nminimum revenue commitment and all potential occupancy-based variable services revenue, the New PCC Contract\nprovides for a maximum total contract amount of approximately $1.8 billion through 2028, assuming all option periods\nare exercised.\nOur NP Partner depends on the U.S. government and its funding. Any impasse or delay in reaching a federal budget\nagreement, debt ceiling or government shutdowns, and the subsequent lack of funding to the applicable government entity,\ncould result in material payment delays, payment reductions or contract terminations. The government may terminate this\ncontract with our NP Partner for convenience; in the event this should occur, our NP Partner may terminate its agreement\nwith the Company for convenience.\nRegulatory and Environmental Compliance\nOur business and the businesses of the Company’s customers can be affected significantly by federal, state, municipal and\nlocal laws and regulations relating to the natural resource and mining industries, food safety and environmental protection.\nThe Company incurs significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in operating its business. However,\nchanges in these laws, including more stringent regulations and increased levels of enforcement of these laws and\nregulations, or new interpretations thereof, and the development of new laws and regulations could impact the Company’s\nbusiness and result in increased compliance or operating costs associated with its or its customers’ operations.\nIn addition, our customers include U.S. government contractors, which means that we may, indirectly, be subject to various\nstatutes and regulations applicable to doing business with the U.S. government. U.S. government contracts and grants\nnormally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us\nto liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. If we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements,\nour contracts may be subject to termination, and we may be subject to financial and/or other liability under its contracts or\nunder the Federal Civil False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”).\n18\nTo the extent that these laws and regulations impose more stringent requirements or increased costs or delays upon the\nCompany’s customers in the performance of their operations, the resulting demand for the Company’s services by those\ncustomers may be adversely affected. Moreover, climate change laws or regulations could increase the cost of consuming,\nand thereby reduce demand for natural resources, which could reduce the Company’s customers’ demand for its services.\nThe Company cannot predict changes in the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how these laws and\nregulations may be interpreted or the effect changes in these laws and regulations may have on the Company or its\ncustomers or on our future operations or earnings. The Company also cannot predict the extent to which new laws and\nregulations will be adopted or whether such new laws and regulations may impose more stringent or costly restrictions on\nits customers or its operations.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop talent to deliver on the\nCompany’s strategy. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources programs are designed to: keep\nemployees safe and healthy; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more\ninclusive; acquire and retain diverse talent; reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefit programs;\ndevelop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions; and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a\nhigh-performing workforce.\nThe Company employed approximately 984 people as of December 31, 2023. Our workforce is primarily comprised of\nfull-time employees. Of the total population as of December 31, 2023, approximately 570 of our employees worked in the\nHFS–South segment, approximately 287 of our employees worked in the Government segment, and approximately 59 of\nour employees worked in the All Other segment. The remaining 68 employees worked in Corporate. None of the\nCompany’s employees are unionized or members of collective bargaining arrangements.\nThe Company focuses on the following in managing its human capital:\n•Health and safety: We have a safety program that focuses on implementing management systems, policies\nand training programs and performing assessments to see that workers are trained properly, and that injuries\nand incidents are prevented. All of our employees are empowered with stop-work authority which enables\nthem to immediately stop any unsafe or potentially hazardous working condition or behavior they may\nobserve. We utilize a mixture of indicators to assess the safety performance of our operations, including total\nrecordable injury rate, preventable motor vehicle incidents and corrective actions. We also recognize\noutstanding safety behaviors through us at the local community level. Importantly, during the COVID-19\npandemic, our continuing focus on health and safety enabled us to preserve business continuity without\nsacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues safe.\n•Employee wellness: The Company’s Safe & Healthy program is a comprehensive approach to wellness\nthat encourages healthy behaviors and is intended to raise morale, productivity, and overall employee\nengagement. The program includes a health assessment, no cost preventive care through the medical plan,\ntobacco cessation support through our medical insurance carrier, and an employee assistance program.\nApproximately 38% of eligible employees participated in the Health & Safety program in 2023.\n•Diversity & Inclusion (“D&I”): Inclusion is how we foster an environment where various backgrounds\nare celebrated and encouraged to grow and learn by valuing the skills and expertise a diverse workforce\nprovides. We believe that an inclusive and a diverse team is key to the success of our culture and aim to drive\nD&I initiatives. The Company’s D&I initiatives are operationalized through three core elements: (1) senior\nmanagement’s endorsement of and alignment with the programs; (2) focused efforts in increasing diversity\nin the talent pipeline and our hiring; (3) creating an inclusive work environment where differences are\nwelcomed. The Company analyzes diversity in the workforce on at least an annual basis and develops action\nplans from the results to spark dialogue among employees and leaders in an effort to build a more inclusive,\ndiverse and empowered culture at the Company. As of December 31, 2023, women constituted\napproximately 39% of our workforce and self-identified racial or ethnic minorities represented 81% of our\n19\nworkforce. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core to our culture, and we believe that a diverse workforce\nis critical to our success.\n•Compensation programs and employee benefits: Our compensation and benefits programs provide a\npackage designed to attract, retain and motivate employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, the\nCompany provides a variety of short-term, long-term, and commission-based incentive compensation\nprograms to reward performance relative to key metrics. We offer comprehensive benefit options including\nretirement savings plans, medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance,\naccident and critical illness insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, and flexible\nspending accounts.\n•Employee experience and retention: To evaluate our employee experience and retention efforts, we\nmonitor a number of employee measures, such as employee retention. To provide an open and frequent line\nof communication for all employees, we encourage staff meetings at every community.\n•Training and development: The Company is committed to the continued development of its people. We\naim for all applicable new hires to attend new hire orientation training within 90 days of hire. Additionally,\nwe offer a wide array of training solutions (classroom, hands-on and e-learning) for our employees. In 2023,\nour employees enhanced their skills through training, including safety training, leadership training and\nequipment-related training from our suppliers. Our performance process encourages performance and\ndevelopment check-ins throughout the year to provide for development at all levels across the Company.\nIntellectual Property\nTarget Hospitality owns a number of trademarks important to the business.

Risk Factors\nRisk Factors Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our Common Stock speculative or risky. This\nsummary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor\nsummary, and other risks that we face, can be found immediately following this summary and should be carefully\nconsidered, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC before\nmaking an investment decision regarding our Common Stock.\nOperational Risks\n• Our operations are and will be exposed to operational, economic, political and regulatory risks.\n• We face significant competition in the specialty rental sector.\n• We depend on several significant customers. The loss of one or more of such customers or the inability of one or\nmore such customers to meet their obligations could adversely affect our results of operations.\n• Our business depends on the quality and reputation of the Company and its communities, and any deterioration\nin such quality or reputation could adversely impact its market share, business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\n• We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the Government segment. The loss of, or a significant\ndecrease in revenues from, any customer in this concentrated segment could seriously harm our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n• We are subject to extensive procurement laws, regulations and procedures, including those that enable the U.S.\ngovernment to terminate contracts for convenience.\n• Our business may be adversely affected by periods of low commodity prices or unsuccessful exploration results\nwhich may decrease customers’ spending and our results.\n• Demand for our products and services is sensitive to changes in demand within a number of key industry end-\nmarkets and geographic regions\n• We are subject to fluctuations in occupancy levels, and a decrease in occupancy levels could cause a decrease in\nrevenues and profitability\n• Increased operating costs and obstacles to cost recovery due to the pricing and cancellation terms of our specialty\nrental and hospitality services contracts may constrain its ability to make a profit.\n• Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance, or fail to meet expectations.\n• Public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on business and economic conditions and\ngovernment requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFinancial Accounting Risks\n• If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges,\nwhich would negatively impact our reported operating results.\n• The valuation of our Private Warrants could cause volatility in our net income (loss).\nSocial, Political and Regulatory Risks\n• Failure to comply with government regulations related to food and beverages may subject us to liability.\n• Unanticipated changes in our tax obligations, the adoption of a new tax legislation, or exposure to additional\nincome tax liabilities could affect profitability.\n21\n• We are subject to various laws and regulations including those governing our contractual relationships.\nObligations and liabilities under these laws and regulations may materially harm our business.\n• We are subject to evolving public disclosure, financial reporting and corporate governance expectations and\nregulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance.\nGrowth, Development and Financing Risks\n• We may not be able to successfully acquire and integrate new operations, which could cause our business to\nsuffer.\n• Global, national or local economic movements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInformation Technology and Privacy Risks\n• Any failure of our management information systems could disrupt our business and result in decreased revenue\nand increased overhead costs.\n• Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n• Our leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our business.\n• Global capital and credit markets conditions could materially adversely affect our ability to access the capital\nand credit markets or the ability of key counterparties to perform their obligations to it.\n• We are, and may in the future become, subject to covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility and,\nif we default under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n• We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public\ncompany, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance efforts.\n• Our principal stockholder has substantial control over our business, which may be disadvantageous to other\nstockholders.\nRisk Factors\nOperational Risks\nOur operations are and will be exposed to operational economic, political and regulatory risks.\nOur operations could be affected by economic, political and regulatory risks. These risks include:\n• multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to build and\noperate our communities and other sites;\n• inflation or other increases in costs relating to personnel, utilities, insurance, medical and food, recessions,\nfluctuations in interest rates;\n• compliance with applicable export control laws and economic sanctions laws and regulations;\n• trade protection measures, including increased duties and taxes, and import or export licensing requirements;\n• ownership regulations;\n• compliance with applicable antitrust and other regulatory rules and regulations relating to potential future\nacquisitions;\n• different local product preferences and product requirements;\n• challenges in maintaining, staffing and managing national operations;\n22\n• bankruptcy or insolvency of our customers, thereby reducing demand for our services;\n• different labor regulations;\n• potentially adverse consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n• political and economic instability;\n• federal government budgeting and appropriations;\n• enforcement of remedies in various jurisdictions;\n• the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and\nacquisition expertise will not perform as expected; and\n• differences in business practices that may result in violation of our policies including but not limited to\nbribery and collusive practices.\nThese and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significant competition as a provider of specialty rental and hospitality services in the specialty rental sector.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose customers and our revenue and profitability could decline.\nAlthough our competition varies significantly by market, the specialty rental and hospitality services industry, in general,\nis highly competitive. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price,\nservice, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms. We may experience pricing pressures in our operations\nin the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. We may also face reduced demand\nfor our products and services if our competitors are able to provide new or innovative products or services that better\nappeal to our potential customers. In each of our current markets, we face competition from national, regional and local\ncompanies who have an established market position in the specific service area. We expect to encounter similar\ncompetition in any new markets that we may enter. Some of our competitors may have greater market share, greater pricing\nflexibility, more attractive product or service offerings, or superior marketing and financial resources. In addition, if some\nof our government customers have capacity at the facilities which they operate, they may choose to use less capacity at\nour facilities. Increased competition could result in lower profit margins, substantial pricing pressure, and reduced market\nshare. Price competition, together with other forms of competition, may materially adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, and financial condition.\nWe depend on several significant customers. The loss of one or more of such customers or the inability of one or more\nsuch customers to meet their obligations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on several significant customers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our five largest customers accounted\nfor approximately 83% of our total revenue. For a more detailed explanation of our customers, see the section of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Business.” The loss of any one of our largest customers in any of our business\nsegments or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the concentration of customers in the\nindustries in which we operate may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that\ncustomers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, political and industry conditions.\nAs a result of our customer concentration, risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern\nin our business. We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. Failure\nto manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in the write-off of\ncustomer receivables. If we are not able to manage credit risk, or if a number of significant customers should have financial\ndifficulties at the same time, our credit and equipment losses would increase above historical levels. If this should occur,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The inability or\nfailure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect\nour financial results.\n23\nOur business depends on the quality and reputation of the Company and its communities. Any deterioration in the\nquality and reputation of the Company or public resistance, potential legal challenges to, and increasing scrutiny of\nour industry, could affect our ability to obtain new contracts or result in the loss of existing contracts and negatively\nimpact our brand or reputation, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nMany factors can influence our reputation and the value of our communities, including quality of services, food quality\nand safety, availability and management of scarce natural resources, supply chain management, diversity, human rights\nand support for local communities. In addition, events that may be beyond our control could affect the reputation of one\nor more of our communities or more generally impact the reputation of the Company, including protests directed at\ngovernment immigration policies, violent incidents at one or more communities or other sites or criminal activity.\nReputational value is also based on perceptions, and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide\npublic feedback that can influence perceptions of the Company and its communities, and it may be difficult to control or\neffectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. While reputations may take decades to build,\nnegative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social\nmedia publicity, governmental investigations or penalties, or litigation. Negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse\neffects on our business, including customer boycotts, loss of customers, loss of development opportunities or employee\nretention and recruiting difficulties. A decline in the reputation or perceived quality of our communities or corporate image\ncould negatively affect its market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased public resistance, including negative media attention and public opinion, to the use of private companies for the\nmanagement and operation of facilities supporting immigration, may negatively impact our brand and the public perception\nof the Company. Maintaining and promoting our brand will depend largely on our ability to differentiate ourselves from\nthe direct participants in the ongoing conflict around immigration policy. If we are portrayed negatively in the press or\nassociated with the ongoing social and political debates around immigration policy, our public image and reputation could\nbe irreparably tarnished and our brand could be harmed. If we are unable to counter such negative media attention\neffectively, investors may lose confidence in our business, which could result in a decline in the trading price of our\nCommon Stock, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nFurthermore, our relationship with the U.S. government subjects us and our government contractor customers to unique\nrisks such as unanticipated increased costs and litigation that could materially adversely affect our or their business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations. These operational risks and others associated with privately managing\nresidential facilities could result in higher costs associated with staffing and lead to increased litigation. Lawsuits, to which\nwe are not a party, have challenged the government’s policy of detaining migrant families, and government policies with\nrespect to family immigration may impact the demand for our facilities. Any court decision or government action that\nimpacts our customers’ existing contracts with the government could impact our subcontracts for the facilities and result\nin a reduction in demand for our services or reputational damage to us, and require us to devote a significant amount of\ntime and expense to the defense of our operations and reputation, which could materially affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the Government segment. The loss of, or a significant decrease in\nrevenues from, any customer in this concentrated segment could seriously harm our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our subcontracts with government contractors. These revenues depend\non the U.S. government and its contractors receiving sufficient funding and providing it with timely payment under the\nterms of our contracts. If the applicable government entity does not receive sufficient appropriations to cover its contractual\nobligations, it may delay or reduce payment to its contractors and, as a result, our government contractor customers may\ndelay or reduce payments to or terminate their contracts with us. Any future impasse or struggle impacting the federal\ngovernment’s ability to reach agreement on the federal budget, debt ceiling or any future federal government shut downs\ncould result in material payment delays, payment reductions or contract terminations. Additionally, our current and\npotential future government contractor customers may request in the future that we reduce our contract rates or forego\nincreases to those rates as a way for those contractors to control costs and help their government customers to control their\n24\nspending and address their budgetary shortfalls. For additional information regarding our operation of the Government\nsegment, see the section entitled “Business—Business Operations—Government”.\nThe U.S. government and, by extension, our U.S. government contractor customers, may also from time to time adopt,\nimplement or modify certain policies or directives that may adversely affect our business. For example, while the U.S.\ngovernment is currently using private immigration sites like the South Texas Family Residential Center, federal, state or\nlocal governmental partners may in the future choose to undertake a review of their utilization of privately operated\nfacilities, or may cancel or decide not to renew existing contracts with their government contractors, who may, in turn,\ncancel or decide not to renew their contracts with us. Changes in government policy, presidential administration or other\nchanges in the political landscape relating to immigration policies may similarly result in a decline in our revenues in the\nGovernment segment. In addition, lawsuits, to which we are not a party, have challenged the U.S. government’s policy of\ndetaining migrant families, and government policies with respect to immigration may impact the demand for our facilities\nand any facilities that we may operate in the future. Any court decision or government action that impacts our existing\ncontracts or any future contracts for similar facilities could materially affect our cash flows, financial condition and results\nof operations. Further, we may not be able to renew our agreements with the government contractors or enter new\nagreements with these contractors. Any renewals or new agreements we may enter may be on terms that are materially\nless favorable to us than those in our current agreements.\nWe are subject to extensive procurement laws, regulations and procedures, including those that enable the U.S.\ngovernment to terminate contracts for convenience. Our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we or\nthose we do business with fail to comply with or adapt to existing or new procurement laws and regulations, which are\nregularly evolving.\nAs a U.S. government subcontractor, we and others with which we do business must comply with laws and regulations\nrelating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. Government contract laws and\nregulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation\nof these laws and regulations by us, our employees, others working on our behalf or a supplier could harm our reputation\nand result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding\non or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to export products or perform services and civil or criminal investigations\nor proceedings. In addition, costs to comply with new government regulations can increase our costs, reduce our margins\nand adversely affect our competitiveness.\nGovernment contract laws and regulations can impose terms or obligations that are different than those typically found in\ncommercial transactions. One of the significant differences is that the U.S. government generally may terminate its\ncontracts, not only for default based on our performance, but also at its convenience. Generally, prime contractors have a\nsimilar right under subcontracts related to government contracts. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we typically\nwould be entitled to receive payments for our allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for\nthe work performed. However, to the extent insufficient funds have been appropriated by the U.S. government to the\nprogram to cover our costs upon a termination for convenience, the U.S. government may assert that it is not required to\nappropriate additional funding. If a contract is terminated for default, the U.S. government could make claims to reduce\nthe contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties, exposing us to liability and\nadversely affecting our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, the U.S. government could terminate\na prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the fact that our performance and the quality of the\nservices we delivered were consistent with our contractual obligations as a subcontractor. Similarly, the U.S. government\ncould indirectly terminate a program or contract by not appropriating funding. The decision to terminate programs or\ncontracts for convenience or default could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Additionally,\nthe U.S. government increasingly has relied on competitive contract award types, including indefinite-delivery, indefinite-\nquantity and other multi-award contracts, which have the potential to create pricing pressure and to increase costs by\nrequiring prime contractors to submit multiple bids and proposals. Multi-award contracts require our prime contractor to\nmake sustained efforts to obtain task orders under the contract. Additionally, procurements that do not evaluate whether\nthe cost assumptions in the bids are realistic can lead to bidders taking aggressive pricing positions, which could result in\nthe winner realizing a loss upon contract award or an increased risk of lower margins or realizing a loss over the term of\nthe contract. For a broader discussion of the indirect exposure to statutes and regulations applicable to U.S. government\ncontractors please see “We are subject to various laws and regulations including those governing our contractual\n25\nrelationships with the U.S. government and U.S. government contractors and the health and safety of our workforce and\nour customers. Obligations and liabilities under these laws and regulations may materially harm our business.” below.\nOur natural resource development customers are exposed to a number of unique operating risks and challenges which\ncould also adversely affect us.\nDemand for our services is sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the\ncorresponding capital spending by, natural resource development companies. The natural resource development industries’\nwillingness to explore, develop, and produce depends largely upon the availability of attractive resource prospects and the\nprevailing view of their future cash flows. Prices for energy products can be subject to large fluctuations in response to\nchanges in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty, and a variety of other factors that are\nbeyond our control. This volatility causes natural resource development companies to change their strategies and\nexpenditure levels. Accordingly, we could be impacted by disruptions to our customers’ operations caused by, among\nother things, any one of or all of the following singularly or in combination:\n• worldwide economic activity including growth in developing countries, U.S. and international tax policies,\npricing and demand for the natural resources being produced at a given project (or proposed project);\n• national government political requirements, including the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCompanies (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels and government policies which could nationalize\nor expropriate natural resource development exploration, production, refining or transportation assets;\n• the level of activity in U.S. shale development;\n• unexpected problems, higher costs and delays during the development, construction, and project start-up\nwhich may delay the commencement of production;\n• unforeseen and adverse geological, geotechnical, and seismic conditions;\n• lack of availability of sufficient water or power to maintain their operations;\n• lack of availability or failure of the required infrastructure necessary to maintain or to expand their\noperations;\n• the breakdown or shortage of equipment and labor necessary to maintain their operations;\n• risks associated with the natural resource industry being subject to various regulatory approvals. Such risks\nmay include governmental actions;\n• interruptions to the operations of our customers caused by industrial accidents or disputes or weather\nconditions and natural disasters; and\n• delays in or failure to commission new infrastructure in timeframes so as not to disrupt customer operations.\nThe carrying value of our communities could be reduced by extended periods of limited or no activity by our customers,\nwhich would require us to record impairment charges equal to the excess of the carrying value of the communities over\nfair value. We may incur asset impairment charges in the future, which charges may affect negatively our results of\noperations and financial condition as well as our borrowing base.\nOur business is contract intensive. Servicing existing contracts may lead to customer disputes or delays in receipt of\npayments, and failure to retain our current customers, renew existing customer contracts, and obtain new customer\ncontracts, or the termination of existing contracts, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is contract intensive and we are party to many contracts with customers. We periodically review our\ncompliance with contract terms and provisions. If customers were to dispute our contract determinations, the resolution\nof such disputes in a manner adverse to our interests could negatively affect sales and operating results. In the past, some\nof our customers have opted to withhold payment due to contract or other disputes, which has delayed our receipt of\npayments. While we do not believe any reviews, audits, delayed payments, or other such matters should result in material\n26\nadjustments, if a large number of our customer arrangements were modified or payments withheld in response to any such\nmatter, the effect could be materially adverse to our business or results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew or replace our existing customer contracts, and\nobtain new business. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including overall customer expenditure\nlevels and the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively\nand differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new business, renew\nexisting customer contracts at the same or higher levels of pricing, or at all, or that our current customers will not turn to\ncompetitors, cease operations, elect to self-operate, or terminate contracts with us. In the context of a potential depressed\ncommodity price environment, our customers may not renew contracts on terms favorable to us or, in some cases, at all,\nand we may have difficulty obtaining new business. As a result, our customers may choose to terminate their contracts.\nThe likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness as we\nencountered with various customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, if any of our customers fail to reach final\ninvestment decisions with respect to projects for which such customers have already awarded us contracts to provide\nrelated accommodations, those customers may terminate such contracts. Customer contract cancellations, the failure to\nrenew a significant number of our existing contracts, or the failure to obtain new business would have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in occupancy levels, and a decrease in occupancy levels could cause a decrease in\nrevenues and profitability.\nWhile a substantial portion of our cost structure is fixed, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated under facility\nmanagement contracts that, to a certain extent, are based on variable occupancy levels. We are dependent upon our\ncustomers and, with respect to our subcontracts with the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, to provide occupants\nfor facilities we operate. We cannot control occupancy levels at the facilities we operate. Under a variable rate structure,\na decrease in our occupancy rates could cause a decrease in revenue and profitability. Occupancy rates have decreased in\nthe past and may decrease in the future, including as a result of changes in public policy or increased public resistance to\nour industry. When combined with relatively fixed costs for operating each facility, a decrease in occupancy levels could\nhave an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.\nBecause of the uncertainty in estimating future occupancy levels, our estimates and Company forecast may prove to be\ninaccurate. Therefore, any business deterioration, including as a result of contract cancellations or decreased occupancy\nlevels, could cause our actual revenues, earnings and cash flows to decline below our current financial outlook.\nWe may be adversely affected if customers reduce their specialty rental and hospitality services outsourcing.\nOur business and growth strategies depend in large part on customers outsourcing some or all of the services that we\nprovide. We cannot be certain that these customer preferences for outsourcing will continue or that customers that have\noutsourced accommodations will not decide to perform these functions themselves or only outsource accommodations\nduring the development or construction phases of their projects. In addition, labor unions representing customer employees\nand contractors may oppose outsourcing accommodations to the extent that the unions believe that third-party\naccommodations negatively impact union membership and recruiting. The reversal or reduction in customer outsourcing\nof accommodations could negatively impact our financial results and growth prospects.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could materially adversely\naffect our future revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions such as fires, floods, hurricanes,\nearthquakes, outbreaks of epidemic or pandemic disease and terrorism, which could adversely affect its future revenue and\nfinancial condition and increase its costs and expenses. For example, extreme weather, particularly periods of high rainfall,\nhail, tornadoes, or extreme cold, in any of the areas in which we operate may cause delays in our community construction\nactivities or result in the cessation of customer operations at one or more communities for an extended period of time such\nas during the COVID-19 pandemic. See “We are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business and our\ninsurance may not fully protect us.” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\n27\nOperations—Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Natural Disasters or Other Significant Disruption.” In addition,\nthe occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks may directly or indirectly affect economic conditions, which could in turn\nadversely affect demand for our communities and services. In the event of a major natural or man-made disaster, we could\nexperience loss of life of our employees, destruction of our communities or other sites, or business interruptions, any of\nwhich may materially adversely affect our business. If any of our communities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it\ncould disrupt our operations, delay services, staffing and revenue recognition, and result in expenses to repair or replace\nthe damaged facility not covered by asset, liability, business continuity or other insurance contracts. Also, we could face\nsignificant increases in premiums or losses of coverage due to the loss experienced during and associated with these and\npotential future natural or man-made disasters that may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, attacks or\narmed conflicts that directly impact one or more of our properties or communities could significantly affect our ability to\noperate those properties or communities and thereby impair our results of operations.\nMore generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased\nvolatility in the global economy and worldwide financial markets. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nConstruction risks exist which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere are a number of general risks that might impinge on companies involved in the development, construction and\ninstallation of facilities as a prerequisite to the management of those assets in an operational sense. We are exposed to the\nfollowing risks in connection with our construction activities:\n• the construction activities of our accommodations are partially dependent on the supply of appropriate\nconstruction and development opportunities;\n• development approvals, slow decision making by counterparties, complex construction specifications,\nchanges to design briefs, legal issues, and other documentation changes may give rise to delays in completion,\nloss of revenue, and cost over-runs which may, in turn, result in termination of accommodation supply\ncontracts;\n• other time delays that may arise in relation to construction and development include supply of labor, scarcity\nof construction materials, real estate or leasing issues, lower than expected productivity levels, inclement\nweather conditions, land contamination or environmental claims, cultural heritage claims, difficult site\naccess, or industrial relations issues;\n• objections to our activities or those of our customers aired by community interests, political, environment\nand/or neighborhood groups which may cause delays in the granting or approvals and/or the overall progress\nof a project;\n• where we assume design responsibility, there is a risk that design problems or defects may result in\nrectification and/or costs or liabilities which we cannot readily recover; and\n• there is a risk that we may fail to fulfill our statutory and contractual obligations in relation to the quality of\nour materials and workmanship, including warranties and defect liability obligations.\nDemand for our products and services is sensitive to changes in demand within a number of key industry end-markets\nand geographic regions.\nOur financial performance is dependent on the level of demand for our facilities and services, which is sensitive to the\nlevel of demand within various sectors, in particular, the natural resource development and government end-markets. Each\nof these sectors is influenced not only by the state of the general global economy but by a number of more specific factors\nas well. For example, demand for workforce accommodations within the natural resources sector may be materially\nadversely affected by a decline in global commodity prices. Demand for our facilities and services may also vary among\ndifferent localities or regions. The levels of activity in these sectors and geographic regions may also be cyclical, and we\nmay not be able to predict the timing, extent or duration of the activity cycles in the markets in which we or our key\ncustomers operate. A decline or slowed growth in any of these sectors or geographic regions could result in reduced\n28\ndemand for our products and services, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition.\nCertain of our major communities are located on land subject to leases. If we are unable to renew a lease, we could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nCertain of our major communities are located on land subject to leases. Accordingly, while we own the accommodations\nassets, we only own a leasehold interest in those properties. If we are found to be in breach of a lease, we could lose the\nright to use the property. In addition, unless we can extend the terms of these leases before their expiration, as to which no\nassurance can be given, we will lose our right to operate our facilities located on these properties upon expiration of the\nleases. In that event, we would be required to remove our accommodations assets and remediate the site. Generally, our\nleases have an average term of seven years and generally contain unilateral renewal provisions. We can provide no\nassurances that we will be able to renew our leases upon expiration on similar terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew\nleases on similar terms, it may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThird parties may fail to provide necessary services and materials for our communities and other sites.\nWe are often dependent on third parties to supply services and materials for our communities and other sites. We typically\ndo not enter into long-term contracts with third-party suppliers. We may experience supply problems as a result of\nlogistical, financial or operating difficulties or the failure or consolidation of our suppliers. We may also experience supply\nproblems as a result of shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations\nby suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase\nproducts. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products and services\nthat we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to\nproduce or supply our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely\nmanner, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIt may become difficult for us to find and retain qualified employees, and failure to do so could impede our ability to\nexecute our business plan and growth strategy.\nOne of the most important factors in our ability to provide reliable and quality services and profitably execute our business\nplan is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. The competition for qualified personnel in the\nindustries in which we operate is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain\nall personnel necessary for the development and operation of our business. In periods of higher activity, it may become\nmore difficult to find and retain qualified employees which could limit growth, increase operating costs, or have other\nmaterial adverse effects on our operations. In addition, labor shortages, the inability to hire or retain qualified employees\nnationally, regionally or locally or increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to control\nexpenses and efficiently conduct operations.\nMany of our key executives, managers, and employees have knowledge and an understanding of our business and our\nindustry that cannot be readily duplicated and they are the key individuals that interface with customers. In addition, the\nability to attract and retain qualified personnel is dependent on the availability of qualified personnel, the impact on\nthe labor supply due to general economic or political conditions, and the ability to provide a competitive compensation\npackage.\nSignificant increases in operating costs, including raw material and labor costs, could increase our operating costs\nsignificantly and harm our profitability.\nWe incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including steel, lumber, siding and roofing, fuel and other products to\nconstruct and perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our facilities\nas well as the construction of our communities and other sites. The volume, timing, and mix of such work may vary\nquarter-to-quarter and year- to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will increase the acquisition costs\nof new facilities and also increase the construction, repair, and maintenance costs of our facilities. During periods of rising\nprices for labor or raw materials, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than\n29\nnormal, we may incur significant increases in our costs for new facilities and incur higher operating costs that we may not\nbe able to recoup from customers through changes in pricing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability can also be adversely affected to the extent we are faced with cost increases for food, wages and other\nlabor related expenses, insurance, fuel and utilities, especially to the extent we are unable to recover such increased costs\nthrough increases in the prices for our services, due to one or more of general economic conditions, competitive conditions\nor contractual provisions in our customer contracts. Substantial increases in the cost of fuel and utilities have historically\nresulted in cost increases in our communities. From time to time we have experienced increases in our food costs. In\naddition, food prices can fluctuate as a result of inflation, foreign exchange rates and temporary changes in supply,\nincluding as a result of incidences of severe weather such as droughts, heavy rains, and late freezes. Although we negotiate\nthe pricing and other terms for the majority of our purchases of food and related products directly with national\nmanufacturers, we purchase these products and other items through national distributors and suppliers. If our relationship\nwith, or the business of a primary distributor were to be disrupted, we would have to arrange alternative distributors and\nour operations and cost structure could be adversely affected in the short term. We may be unable to fully recover costs,\nand such increases would negatively impact its profitability on contracts that do not contain such inflation protections.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance, or fail to meet expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance, or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and\ninvestors. Our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control,\nincluding but not limited to:\n• general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we own or operate communities;\n• natural disasters, including pandemics and endemics, and business interruptions;\n• executive and legislative policies where we provide our services;\n• the budgetary constraints of the government and/or our customers;\n• the success of our strategic growth initiatives;\n• the costs associated with the launching or integrating new or acquired businesses;\n• the cost, type, and timing of customer orders;\n• the nature and duration of the needs of our customers;\n• the raw material or labor costs of servicing our facilities;\n• the timing of new product or service introductions by us, our suppliers, and our competitors;\n• changes in end-user demand requirements, including variable occupancy levels associated with contracts in\nthe Government segment;\n• the mix, by state and region, of our revenue, personnel, and assets;\n• movements in interest rates, or tax rates;\n• changes in, and application of, accounting rules;\n• changes in the regulations applicable to us;\n• litigation matters;\n• the success of large scale capital intensive projects;\n• liquidity, including the impact of our debt service costs; and\n• attrition and retention risk.\n30\nAs a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results.\nWe are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully protect us.\nWe are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business, and our operations are subject to many hazards. In the\nordinary course of business, we may become the subject of various claims, lawsuits, and administrative proceedings\nseeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees, and other matters,\nincluding occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or\noperations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities\nmay have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses.\nOur insurance policies have deductibles or self-insured retentions which would require us to expend amounts prior to\ntaking advantage of coverage limits. We believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for the protection of our assets\nand operations. However, our insurance may not fully protect us for certain types of claims such as dishonest, fraudulent,\ncriminal or malicious acts; terrorism, war, hostile or warlike action during a time of peace; automobile physical damage;\nnatural disasters; and certain cyber-crime. A judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be\nuninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Even a partially\nuninsured or underinsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our results\nof operations or consolidated financial position. The specifications and insured limits under those policies, however, may\nbe insufficient for such claims. We also face the following other risks related to our insurance coverage, including we may\nnot be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms; the counterparties to our insurance contracts\nmay pose credit risks; and we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage each\nof which, individually or in the aggregate, could materially and adversely impact our business. Further, due to rising\ninsurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will\ncontinue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available.\nPublic health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on business and economic conditions and\ngovernment requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the various measures that are\nimplemented to protect public health, which can adversely affect the economy and financial markets. We have\nimplemented business continuity plans to continue to provide specialty rental and hospitality services to our customers\nand to support our operations, while taking health and safety measures such as incentivizing employee vaccination,\nimplementing worker distancing measures and masking measures and using a remote workforce where possible. There\ncan be no assurance that the continued spread of COVID-19, or any future health public crisis, and efforts to contain such\npublic health crisis (including, but not limited to, vaccination, social distancing and masking policies, restrictions on travel\nand reduced operations) will not materially impact our results of operations and financial position.\nFinancial Accounting Risks\nIf we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges,\nwhich would negatively impact our reported operating results.\nWe have goodwill, which represents the excess of the total purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the\nassets acquired, and other intangible assets. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $41.0 million and\n$66.3 million of goodwill and other intangible assets, net, respectively, in our statement of financial position, which\nrepresents approximately 5.9% and 9.5% of total assets, respectively. We review goodwill and intangible assets at least\nannually for impairment. In the event impairment is identified, a charge to earnings would be recorded. Impairment may\nresult from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and\nsignificant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. Any impairment charges could adversely\naffect our reported results of operations and financial condition.\n31\nThe valuation of our Private Warrants could increase the volatility in our net income (loss) in our consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income (loss).\nThe change in fair value of our Private Warrants is the result of changes in stock price and Private Warrants outstanding\nat each reporting period. Our Private Warrants are required to be carried at fair value, with changes in the valuation\nimpacting net income (loss). The Private Warrants, which expire on March 15, 2024, are valued using a Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model under which fair value is impacted by various assumptions, including the volatility of stock prices.\nSignificant changes to our stock price or number of Private Warrants outstanding may adversely affect our net income\n(loss) in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nSocial, Political, Regulatory and Litigation Risks\nA failure to maintain food safety or comply with government regulations related to food and beverages may subject us\nto liability.\nClaims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry, and a number\nof these claims may exist at any given time. Because food safety issues could be experienced at the source or by food\nsuppliers or distributors, food safety could, in part, be out of our control. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of\nfood-borne illness or other food safety issues such as food tampering or contamination at one of our locations could\nadversely impact our reputation, hindering our ability to renew contracts on favorable terms or to obtain new business, and\nhave a negative impact on our sales. Future food product recalls and health concerns associated with food contamination\nmay also increase our raw materials costs and, from time to time, disrupt its business.\nA variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling, preparation, and serving of food (including,\nin some cases, requirements relating to the temperature of food), and the cleanliness of food production facilities and the\nhygiene of food-handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level. We cannot assure\nyou that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply\nwith any future laws and regulations. Furthermore, legislation and regulatory attention to food safety is very high.\nAdditional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance or expose us to liabilities.\nIf we are unable to maintain food safety or comply with government regulations related to food and beverages, the effect\ncould be materially adverse to our business or results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax obligations, the adoption of a new tax legislation, or exposure to additional income\ntax liabilities could affect profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services,\nfunding, and other intercompany transactions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, or other tax\npositions and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of examinations in order to determine the\nappropriateness of its tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of\npotential examinations, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different\nfrom the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on its\nresults of operations and cash flows. In addition, our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to its\noperating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries and/or states with differing statutory tax rates, changes in\nthe valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course\nof our tax return preparation process.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations including those governing our contractual relationships with the U.S.\ngovernment and U.S. government contractors and the health and safety of our workforce and our customers.\nObligations and liabilities under these laws and regulations may materially harm our business.\nOur customers include U.S. government contractors, which means that we may, indirectly, be subject to various statutes\nand regulations applicable to doing business with the U.S. government. These types of contracts customarily contain\nprovisions that give the U.S. government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in\n32\ncommercial contracts and which are unfavorable to contractors, including provisions that allow the government to\nunilaterally terminate or modify our customers’ federal government contracts, in whole or in part, at the government’s\nconvenience. Under general principles of U.S. government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract for\nconvenience, the terminated party may generally recover only its incurred or committed costs and settlement expenses and\nprofit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, the defaulting party\nmay be liable for any extra costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. In\naddition, our or our customers’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties\nor the suspension of our customers’ government contracts or debarment and, as a result, the loss of the related revenue\nwhich would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are not aware of any action contemplated\nby any regulatory authority related to any possible non-compliance by or in connection with our operations.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of\ndoing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These\nrequirements include, for example:\n• specialized disclosure and accounting requirements unique to U.S. government contracts;\n• financial and compliance audits that may result in potential liability for price adjustments, recoupment of\ngovernment funds after such funds have been spent, civil and criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions\nsuch as suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government;\n• public disclosures of certain contract and company information; and\n• mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor requirements, non-discrimination and\naffirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, our contracts may be subject to termination, and we may be\nsubject to financial and/or other liability under its contracts or under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act’s\n“whistleblower” provisions allow private individuals, including present and former employees, to sue on behalf of the U.S.\ngovernment. The False Claims Act statute provides for treble damages and other penalties and, if our operations are found\nto be in violation of the False Claims Act, we could face other adverse action, including suspension or prohibition from\ndoing business with the U.S. government. Any penalties, fines, suspension or damages could adversely affect our financial\nresults as well as our ability to operate our business.\nFurther, our operations are subject to an array of other governmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we\noperate. Our activities are subject to regulation by several federal and state government agencies, including OSHA and by\nfederal and state laws. Our operations and activities in other jurisdictions are subject to similar governmental regulations.\nSimilar to conventionally constructed buildings, the workforce housing industry is also subject to regulations by multiple\ngovernmental agencies in each jurisdiction relating to, among others, environmental, zoning and building standards, and\nhealth, safety and transportation matters. Noncompliance with applicable regulations, implementation of new regulations\nor modifications to existing regulations may increase costs of compliance, require a termination of certain activities or\notherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various anti-corruption laws and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign\ngovernments and their officials by a U.S. person for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our activities create\nthe risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of\nvarious laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”). We have implemented safeguards and\npolicies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, existing safeguards and any future\nimprovements may prove to be ineffective and employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held\nresponsible.\nIf employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to\naccurately record its transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-\n33\ncorruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including suspension or debarment from\nU.S. government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to similar anti-corruption laws in other\njurisdictions.\nWe may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change and other environmental laws\nand regulations.\nAll of our and our customers’ operations may be affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the\ndischarge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Among other things, these\nlaws and regulations impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the\nuse, disposal and management of, regulated materials and waste, and impose liabilities for the costs of investigating and\ncleaning up, and damages resulting from, present and past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or\nmaterials. In the ordinary course of business, we use and generate substances that are regulated or may be hazardous under\nenvironmental laws. We have an inherent risk of liability under environmental laws and regulations, both with respect to\nongoing operations and with respect to contamination that may have occurred in the past on our properties or as a result\nof our operations. From time to time, our operations or conditions on properties that we have acquired have resulted in\nliabilities under these environmental laws. We may in the future incur material costs to comply with environmental laws\nor sustain material liabilities from claims concerning noncompliance or contamination. We have no reserves for any such\nliabilities. Environmental laws and regulations are likely to change in the future under different administrations, possibly\nresulting in more stringent requirements. Our or any of our customers’ failure to comply with applicable environment laws\nand regulations may result in any of the following:\n• issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n• denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n• reduction or cessation of operations; and\n• performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to predict how environmental legislation may change or how new regulations that may\nbe adopted would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or\nadditional operating restrictions for us or our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand\nfor our services.\nThere are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions, which are in various\nphases of discussion or implementation. For example, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that\ncommits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, an indefinite suspension of new oil and\nnatural gas leases on public lands pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal energy\nand natural resource permitting and leasing practices. It remains unclear what additional actions President Biden, or a\nfuture administration, will take and what support he will have for any potential legislative changes from Congress. The\noutcome of U.S. federal, regional, provincial, and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety\nof regulatory programs including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other\nregulatory actions. These actions could:\n• result in increased costs associated with our operations and our customers’ operations;\n• increase other costs to our business;\n• reduce the demand for carbon-based fuels; and\n• reduce the demand for our services.\nAny adoption of these or similar proposals by U.S. federal, regional, provincial, or state governments mandating a\nsubstantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry.\n34\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address\ngreenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased\ncompliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand\nfor our services. See “Business—Regulatory and Environmental Compliance” for a more detailed description of our\nclimate-change related risks.\nWe may be subject to litigation, judgments, orders or regulatory proceedings that could materially harm our business.\nWe are subject to claims arising from disputes with customers, employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal\ncourse of business. The risks associated with any such disputes may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence\nand magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to\nsuccessfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable\nto us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. To the extent that our senior\nexecutives are named in such lawsuits, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs.\nWe are subject to evolving public disclosure, financial reporting and corporate governance expectations and\nregulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory\norganizations, including the SEC and Nasdaq, as well as evolving investor expectations around disclosures, financial\nreporting, corporate governance and environmental and social practices. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in\nscope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the U.S. and foreign\ngovernments, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. The increase in costs to comply with such evolving\nexpectations, rules and regulations, as well as any risk of noncompliance, could adversely impact us.\nGrowth, Development and Financing Risks\nWe may not be able to successfully acquire and integrate new operations, which could cause our business to suffer.\nWe may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions for various reasons. We anticipate that we\nwill consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We cannot predict whether or when\nacquisitions will be completed, and we may face significant competition for certain acquisition targets. Acquisitions that\nare completed involve numerous risks, including the following:\n• difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;\n• diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n• difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where our\ncompetitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n• difficulties in complying with regulations, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to\nan acquired business;\n• an inability to timely complete necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements;\n• an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n• undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition that become\nknown to us only after the acquisition, particularly relating to rental equipment on lease that are unavailable\nfor inspection during the diligence process; and\n• potential loss of key customers or employees.\nIn connection with acquisitions we may assume liabilities or acquire damaged assets, some of which may be unknown at\nthe time of such acquisitions; record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future\n35\nimpairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges; or incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible\nassets.\nThe condition and regulatory certification of any facilities or operations acquired is assessed as part of the acquisition due\ndiligence. In some cases, facility condition or regulatory certification may be difficult to determine due to that facility\nbeing on lease at the time of acquisition and/or inadequate certification records. Facility acquisitions may therefore result\nin a rectification cost which may not have been factored into the acquisition price, impacting ability to deploy and ultimate\nprofitability of the facility acquired.\nAcquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful or will not\nmaterially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we do not manage new markets\neffectively, some of our new communities and acquisitions may lose money or fail, and we may have to close unprofitable\ncommunities. Closing a community in such circumstances would likely result in additional expenses that would cause our\noperating results to suffer. To successfully manage growth, we will need to continue to identify additional qualified\nmanagers and employees to integrate acquisitions within our established operating, financial and other internal procedures\nand controls. We will also need to effectively motivate, train and manage our employees. Failure to successfully integrate\nrecent and future acquisitions and new communities into existing operations could materially adversely affect our results\nof operations and financial condition.\nGlobal, national or local economic movements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in the United States, but our business may be negatively impacted by economic movements or downturns in\nthat market or in global markets generally, including those that could be caused by policy changes by the U.S.\nadministration in areas such as trade and immigration. These adverse economic conditions may reduce commercial\nactivity, cause disruption and volatility in global financial markets, and increase rates of default and bankruptcy. Reduced\ncommercial activity has historically resulted in reduced demand for our products and services. For example, reduced\ncommercial activity in the natural resource development sector in certain markets in which we operate may negatively\nimpact our business. U.S. federal spending cuts or further limitations that may result from presidential or congressional\naction or inaction may also negatively impact our arrangements with government contractor customers. Disruptions in\nfinancial markets could negatively impact the ability of our customers to pay their obligations to us in a timely manner\nand increase our counterparty risk. If economic conditions worsen, we may face reduced demand and an increase, relative\nto historical levels, in the time it takes to receive customer payments. If we are not able to adjust our business in a timely\nand effective manner to changing economic conditions, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nInformation Technology and Privacy Risks\nAny failure of our management information systems could disrupt our business and result in decreased revenue and\nincreased overhead costs.\nWe depend on our management information systems to actively manage our facilities and provide facility information,\nand availability of our services. These functions enhance our ability to optimize facility utilization, occupancy, costs of\ngoods sold, and average daily rate. The failure of our management information systems to perform as anticipated could\ndamage our reputation with our customers, disrupt our business or result in, among other things, decreased revenue and\nincreased overhead costs. For example, an inaccurate utilization rate could cause us to fail to have sufficient inventory to\nmeet consumer demand, resulting in decreased sales. Any such failure could harm our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. In addition, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively\ncould disrupt our business, distract management’s focus and attention from business operations and growth initiatives,\nand increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our operations\nand operating results. Furthermore, these technologies may require refinements and upgrades. The development and\nmaintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us. As various systems and technologies become\noutdated or new technology is required, we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a cost-\neffective and timely manner. As a result, we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new\ntechnology or system.\n36\nLike other companies, our information systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our\ncontrol, including, but not limited to, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including cyber-\nattacks), and other security issues. In addition, because our systems contain information about individuals and businesses,\nthe failure to maintain the security of the data we hold, whether the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of\nothers, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenue, increased costs, regulatory\nsanctions, and other potential material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to\nrender data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and\ninfrastructure or third- party facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various\nprocedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that\nthese procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events\nwere to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities\nessential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of\noperations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious\nsoftware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions\nin critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. Even\nif we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements, we still may not be able to prevent\nsecurity breaches involving sensitive data. Breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or company\ndata could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our website, point of sale systems and other information\ntechnology systems and choose not to stay in our communities or contract with us in the future.\nWhile we have a cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the integrity of our information systems, the\nCompany also maintains cybersecurity insurance in line with industry standards to manage potential liabilities resulting\nfrom specific cyber-attacks. However, it is important to note that although we maintain cybersecurity insurance, there can\nbe no guarantee that our insurance coverage limits will protect against any future claims or that such insurance proceeds\nwill be paid to us in a timely manner.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we, through our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Arrow Bidco, LLC (“Arrow Bidco”), had\n$181.4 million of total indebtedness consisting of $0 borrowings under the ABL Facility and $181.4 million of our 2025\nSenior Secured Notes.\nOur leverage could have important consequences, including:\n• making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt (including the 2025 Senior\nSecured Notes) and liabilities;\n• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt payments, thus reducing\nthe availability of cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures on our\nexisting communities or new communities and for other general corporate purposes;\n• increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or adverse economic or industry conditions;\n• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry;\n• restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities or causing us\nto make non-strategic divestitures; and\n• limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and\nincreasing the costs of such additional financings.\n37\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations, including those under the ABL Facility and the 2025 Senior Secured\nNotes, or to refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our\nability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and\nother factors beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or if future\nborrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity\nneeds, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce\nor delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our\noperations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms\nor at all. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous\ncovenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our existing or future debt instruments may\nlimit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. If we default on the payments required under the terms of certain of\nour indebtedness, that indebtedness, together with debt incurred pursuant to other debt agreements or instruments that\ncontain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient\nfunds to repay all of our debts. As a result, our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service\nobligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse\neffect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to\nsatisfy our debt obligations.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness (including additional secured obligations)\nin the future. Although the Indenture governing our 2025 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Facility contain restrictions\non the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and\nexceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these\nrestrictions could be substantial. If new debt, including future additional secured obligations, is added to our and our\nsubsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase.\nGlobal capital and credit markets conditions could materially adversely affect our ability to access the capital and credit\nmarkets or the ability of key counterparties to perform their obligations to it.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional funds to, among other things, refinance existing indebtedness, fund existing\noperations, improve or expand our operations, respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions. If adequate funds\nare not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to achieve our business or strategic objectives or compete\neffectively. Our ability to pursue certain future opportunities may depend in part on our ongoing access to debt and equity\ncapital markets. We cannot assure you that any such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us or at all. If we\nare unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth.\nEconomic disruptions affecting key counterparties could also have a material adverse effect on our business. We monitor\nthe financial strength of our larger customers, derivative counterparties, lenders, and insurance carriers on a periodic basis\nusing publicly-available information in order to evaluate its exposure to those who have or who it believes may likely\nexperience significant threats to their ability to adequately perform their obligations to it. The information available will\ndiffer from counterparty to counterparty and may be insufficient for us to adequately interpret or evaluate our exposure\nand/or determine appropriate or timely responses.\nWe are, and may in the future become, subject to covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we\ndefault under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.\nThe ABL Facility and the Indenture, as well as any instruments that will govern any future debt obligations, contain\ncovenants that impose significant restrictions on the way the Arrow Bidco and its subsidiaries can operate, including\nrestrictions on the ability to:\n• incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain types of stock;\n• create or incur certain liens;\n• make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to our equity securities;\n38\n• prepay or redeem junior debt;\n• make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;\n• engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n• create unrestricted subsidiaries;\n• create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to,\nand on the transfer of, assets to the issuer or any restricted subsidiary;\n• sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n• sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; and\n• issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.\nAlthough these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, these covenants could limit our\nability to finance future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities\nthat may be in our interest. Arrow Bidco’s ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by\nevents beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If Arrow Bidco defaults\non their obligations under the ABL Facility and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture (as defined below), then the\nrelevant lenders or holders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any,\nimmediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. If the debt under the ABL Facility, the\nIndenture or any other material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be\ninsufficient to repay in full the ABL Facility, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and our other debt.\nThe ABL Facility also requires our subsidiaries to satisfy specified financial maintenance tests. The ability to meet these\ntests could be affected by deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including increases\nin raw materials prices and unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that these tests will be met. If an\nevent of default occurs under the ABL Facility, the lenders thereunder could terminate their commitments and declare all\namounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.\nBorrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be\naccelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, Target Hospitality’s assets may not be sufficient to\nrepay in full that indebtedness and its other indebtedness then outstanding.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted at any time under the ABL Facility will be subject to compliance with limits based\non a periodic borrowing base valuation of the borrowing base assets thereunder. As a result, our access to credit under the\nABL Facility will potentially be subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible\nassets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such\nborrowing base value. As a result of any change in valuation, the availability under the ABL Facility may be reduced, or\nwe may be required to make a repayment of the ABL Facility, which may be significant. The inability to borrow under the\nABL Facility or the use of available cash to repay the ABL Facility as a result of a valuation change may adversely affect\nour liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nRestrictions in Arrow Bidco’s existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to respond to\nchanging conditions.\nThe ABL Facility contains a number of significant covenants including covenants restricting the incurrence of additional\ndebt. The credit agreement governing the ABL Facility requires Arrow Bidco, among other things, to maintain certain\nfinancial ratios or reduce our debt. These restrictions also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future\ndownturn in its business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also\nbe prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive\ncovenants under the ABL Facility and the Indenture impose on it. In addition, complying with these covenants may also\ncause us to take actions that are not favorable to our securityholders and may make it more difficult for us to successfully\nexecute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\n39\nCredit rating downgrades could adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nArrow Bidco’s credit ratings will impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, cost of capital.\nArrow Bidco’s ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to\nmeet our debt obligations. Each rating agency will review these ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that\nsuch ratings will be maintained in the future. A downgrade in Arrow Bidco’s rating could adversely affect our businesses,\ncash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public\ncompany, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance efforts.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance, and other expenses as a result\nof being a public company. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended (the\n“Dodd-Frank Act”) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (“SOX”), as well as related rules implemented by\nthe SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. In addition, rules that the SEC is\nimplementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act may require additional change. Compliance\nwith these and other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of SOX, will substantially\nincrease our expenses, including legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nIt is possible that these expenses will exceed the increases projected by management. These laws, rules, and regulations\nmay also make it more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept\nreduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage, which may\nmake it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors or as officers. Although the\nJOBS Act may, for a limited period of time, somewhat lessen the cost of complying with these additional regulatory and\nother requirements, we nonetheless expect a substantial increase in legal, accounting, insurance, and certain other expenses\nin the future, which will negatively impact its results of operations and financial condition.\nOur principal stockholder has substantial control over our business, which may be disadvantageous to other\nstockholders.\nArrow Holdings and MFA Global S.a r.l., entities controlled by TDR Capital, together beneficially owned approximately\n64% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock as of December 31, 2023. As a result of its ability to control a significant\npercentage of the voting power of our outstanding Common Stock, TDR Capital may have substantial control over matters\nrequiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other\ncorporate transactions. TDR Capital may have interests that are different from those of other stockholders.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nInformation technology (“IT”), digital information and automation are essential components of the Company’s operations\nand growth strategy. The Company recognizes the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining\nrobust cybersecurity measures to safeguard information systems and protect the availability, integrity and confidentiality\nof our data. The Cybersecurity Risk Management & Oversight Committee (consisting of the Senior Vice President of\nBusiness Applications & Digital Transformation, Vice President of IT, a member of our IT department, a senior member\nof our Legal department, and a member of Operations) sets IT risk strategy and makes risk-informed decisions related to\nour technology, which includes the assessment and response to cybersecurity risk.\n40\nThe Company has integrated cybersecurity into its broader internal controls framework. The Company maintains a\ncybersecurity program overseen by the Cybersecurity Risk Management & Oversight Committee and aligns with key\nindustry frameworks including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”). In addition, we have set\nCompany-wide policies and procedures concerning transactional workflow approvals, multifactor authentication, antivirus\nprotection, confidential information and the use of the internet, social media, email, and wireless devices. These policies\ngo through an internal review process and are approved by appropriate members of senior management.\nThe Company has continued to expand investments in IT security, including end user-training, using layered defenses,\nidentifying and protecting critical assets, strengthening monitoring and alerting, and engaging experts. Further, we conduct\nperiodic external penetration tests, vulnerability assessments and maturity testing. These tests and assessments are useful\ntools for maintaining a robust cybersecurity program to protect our investors, customers, employees, vendors and\nintellectual property. Additionally, we perform and document user and administrative access reviews of all domains,\nnetworks, applications, and systems at least quarterly.\nWe view cybersecurity as a shared responsibility. The Company maintains a formal information security training program\nfor all employees that includes training on matters such as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also\nrequired to complete compulsory training on data privacy. Security training is specialized based on employee roles.\nPersonnel\nThe Cybersecurity Risk Management & Oversight Committee is responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity\nrisk, which includes prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. The Cybersecurity Risk\nManagement & Oversight Committee members collectively have relevant expertise in cybersecurity with the appropriate\nexperience, education, and industry standard cybersecurity certifications.\nThe Cybersecurity Risk Management & Oversight Committee works closely with other members of executive\nmanagement to ensure that the Company has effective communication and understanding of its cybersecurity risk\nmanagement.\nThe members of the Cybersecurity Risk Management & Oversight Committee work together to inform the Audit\nCommittee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”) on cybersecurity risks. These reports include,\namong other things, current cybersecurity risk posture, status of projects to strengthen the Company’s information security\nsystems, the effectiveness of our cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies, and any significant cybersecurity\nincidents that have occurred.\nThird Party Engagement\nThe Company engages third-party expertise as part of the broader internal controls framework. These experts include\nindependent cybersecurity assessors, consultants, and our internal audit team to evaluate and stress-test the Company’s\nnetworks, policies, cybersecurity technologies and preventative measures. The Company also engages an independent\nmanaged detection and response provider as an extension of the Company’s cybersecurity team.\nOversight of Third-Party Risk\nThe Company implements stringent processes to oversee and manage risks associated with third-party service providers.\nUpon initial engagement with third-party providers, the Company researches the vendor’s cybersecurity and threat\nreputation. We then require a completed security questionnaire and any relevant documentation including System and\nOrganization Controls (“SOC”) 1 or SOC 2 reports, non-disclosure agreements where applicable, and proof of\ncybersecurity insurance, if necessary. This documentation is compiled and assessed by the Cybersecurity Risk\nManagement & Oversight Committee and documented in a workflow approval process. Existing vendors are evaluated\nbi-annually, and any updates to their cyber posture are documented in the same fashion. The internal business owners of\ncloud-based applications are required to perform and document user access reviews at least quarterly.\n41\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats\nWe are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, interruptions to our computer and IT systems and sophisticated\ncyber-attacks. We have not experienced cybersecurity threats that have materially affected the Company’s results of\noperations or financial condition. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, refer to the section titled\n“Risk Factors” in Part I Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nOur Audit Committee is actively engaged in the oversight of the Company’s information security program. The Audit\nCommittee receives reports on these matters from management, which includes discussion of management’s actions to\nidentify and respond to threats, key performance indicators reflecting cybersecurity posture, and status of recent\ncybersecurity related initiatives. In addition, the Audit Committee periodically evaluates our cybersecurity strategy to\nensure its effectiveness and, if appropriate, includes a review from third-party experts.\nCybersecurity Risk Management & Oversight Committee’s Role Managing Risk\nThe Cybersecurity Risk Management & Oversight Committee continuously updates its approach on cybersecurity to\nsafeguard the Company’s sensitive information and assets based on assessments mentioned above. The program is\nsupported by an organizational structure that reflects support from across the business.\nWhile processes and technologies are in place to minimize the chance of a successful cyber-attack, the Company has\nestablished incident response procedures to address a cybersecurity threat should one occur. The Company’s cybersecurity\nincident response plan (the “Response Plan”) provides for a timely and consistent response to actual or attempted\ncybersecurity incidents impacting the Company. The Response Plan includes (1) detection, (2) analysis, which may include\ntimely notice to our Board and public disclosure if deemed material or appropriate, (3) containment, (4) eradication,\n(5) recovery and (6) post-incident review.\nAs previously mentioned, we face a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with our business. Although such risks\nhave not materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, to date, we\nhave, from time to time, experienced attempted threats to our data and systems. For more information about the\ncybersecurity risks we face, refer to the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n42\nItem 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters are located in The Woodlands, Texas. Our executive, financial, accounting, legal,\nadministrative, management information systems and human resources functions operate from this single, leased office.\nExcept as indicated, we own all of the real property at the locations listed below. Subject to certain exceptions, substantially\nall of our owned personal property and material real property in the U.S. are encumbered under our ABL Facility and the\n2025 Senior Secured Notes. We do not believe that the encumbrances will materially detract from the value of our\nproperties, nor will they materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business. See “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and Note 8—Debt to the notes to consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning our\nABL Facility (as defined below) and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes.

Legal Proceedings\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, most of which arise out of the ordinary course of\nbusiness. The nature of the Company’s business is such that disputes occasionally arise with vendors including suppliers\n43\nand subcontractors, and customers over contract specifications and contract interpretations among other things. The\ncompany assesses these matters on a case-by-case basis as they arise. Reserves are established, as required, based on its\nassessment of exposure. We have insurance policies to cover general liability and workers’ compensation related claims.\nIn the opinion of management, the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under such pending\nlawsuits, claims and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of\noperations, or liquidity. Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties including unfavorable rulings or\ndevelopments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of our legal proceedings could involve amounts that are different\nfrom our currently recorded accruals, and that such differences could be material.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n44\nPart II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “TH.” Through March 15, 2019, our common\nstock, warrants and units were quoted under the symbols “EAGL,” “EAGLW” and “EAGLU,” respectively. Upon\nconsummation of the business combination on March 15, 2019, (i) our public units automatically separated into their\ncomponent securities and, as a result, no longer trade as a separate security and were delisted; (ii) our Common Stock (into\nwhich Platinum Eagle’s ordinary shares were converted) continued to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “TH”; and\n(iii) the Warrants continued to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “THWWW”.\nHolders\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were eleven holders of record of our Common Stock and one holder of record of our\nWarrants. The number of holders of record does not include a substantially greater number of “street name” holders or\nbeneficial holders whose Common Stock or Warrants are held of record by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.\nDividend Information\nWe do not currently pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock. The declaration and amount of any dividends in the\nfuture will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements of our business, covenants\nassociated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors the\nboard of directors deems relevant. We can give no assurances that we will pay a dividend in the future.\nWarrants\nPlatinum Eagle issued warrants to purchase its common stock as components of units sold in the Public Offering (the\n“Public Warrants”, together with the Private Warrants, the “Warrants”). Platinum Eagle also issued, in connection with\nthe Public Offering, the Private Warrants. The Warrants expire at 5:00 pm New York City time on March 15, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 8,044,287 Warrants outstanding. Of the 8,044,287 outstanding, 1,533,334 are Private\nWarrants and 6,510,953 are Public Warrants. The Private Warrants are classified as liabilities under ASC 815-40,\nDerivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity guidance. The Public Warrants are classified as equity based\non the guidance outlined in ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity. Each Warrant\nentitles its holder to purchase Common Stock in accordance with its terms. During the year ended December 31, 2022,\nholders of Public Warrants exercised 7,101 Public Warrants for shares of Common Stock resulting in the Company\nreceiving cash proceeds of approximately $0.1 million and issuing 7,101 shares of Common Stock. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, holders of Public Warrants exercised 17,369 Public Warrants for shares of Common Stock resulting\nin the Company receiving cash proceeds of approximately $0.2 million and issuing 17,369 shares of Common Stock. See\nNote 9 and 17 of the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for additional information.\nWarrant Exchange\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company closed on an offer to exchange the Warrants for shares of its Common Stock in a\ncashless transaction (the “Warrant Exchange”). Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Exchange, the Company issued\n2,996,201 shares of Common Stock. See Note 9 and 17 of the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n45\nPerformance Graph\nThe following stock price performance graph should not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement\nincorporating by reference this Annual Report on Form 10-K into any filing under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act\nof 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by\nreference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts.\nThe graph below compares the cumulative total return of our Common Stock from December 31, 2018, through\nDecember 31, 2023, with the comparable cumulative return of two indices, the Russell Broadbased Total Returns and the\nNasdaq US Benchmark TR Index. The graph plots the change in value of an initial investment in each of our Common\nStock, the Russell 2000 Index, and the Nasdaq US Benchmark Index over the indicated time periods. We have not paid\nany cash dividends and, therefore, the cumulative total return calculation for us is based solely upon the change in share\nprice. The share price performance shown on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.\nComparison of 5 Year Cumulative Total Return\nAssumes Initial Investment of $100\nDecember 2023\n220.00\n200.00\n180.00\n160.00\n140.00\n120.00\n100.00\n80.00\n60.00\n40.00\n20.00\n0.00\n12/31/2018 12/31/2019 12/31/2020 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2023\nTarget Hospitality Corp. NASDAQ US Benchmark TR Russell Broadbased\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes the\nCompany to repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock. The stock repurchase program\ndoes not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares, and the timing and exact amount of any\nrepurchases will depend on various factors, including market pricing and conditions, business, legal, accounting, and other\nconsiderations.\nThe Company may repurchase its shares in open market transactions from time to time or through privately negotiated\ntransactions in accordance with federal securities laws, at the Company’s discretion. The repurchase program, which has\nno expiration date, may be increased, suspended, or terminated at any time. The program is expected to be implemented\n46\nover the course of several years and is conducted subject to the covenants in the agreements governing the Company’s\nindebtedness. No share repurchases were made during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nOn March 6, 2019, our shareholders approved a long-term incentive award plan (the “Plan”) in connection with the\nbusiness combination. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee.

Reserved\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”)\nsummarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital\nresources of Target Hospitality Corp. and is intended to help the reader understand Target Hospitality Corp., our operations\nand our present business environment. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Part II, Item 8 within this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. References to “we,” “us,” “our”, “Target Hospitality,” or “the Company” refer to Target Hospitality Corp.\nand its consolidated subsidiaries.\nExecutive Summary\nTarget Hospitality Corp. is one of North America’s largest providers of vertically integrated specialty rental and value-\nadded hospitality services including: catering and food services, maintenance, housekeeping, grounds-keeping, security,\nhealth and recreation facilities, overall workforce community management, concierge services and laundry service. As\nof December 31, 2023, our network included 28 communities to better serve our customers across the US and Canada.\nEconomic Update\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company continued to experience increasing revenue in the HFS–South\nsegment due to continued improving customer demand and increasing activity in the HFS–South segment as compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s Government segment continued to benefit from the Pecos Children’s\nCenter (“PCC”) contract and the new contracts (the Expanded Humanitarian Contract and the New PCC Contract) thereof\nwith our NP Partner that became effective May 16, 2022 and November 16, 2023, respectively. The Company generated\npositive cash flows from operations of approximately $156.8 million representing a decrease in cash flows from operations\nof approximately $148.8 million or 49% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31,\n2022 driven by the prior period including a significant $194 million upfront payment for expansion efforts related to the\nExpanded Humanitarian Contract, which did not recur in the current period. The Company also reduced its outstanding\ndebt balance on the Senior Secured Notes by $153.1 million or 46% during the year ended December 31, 2023 and reduced\ninterest expense, net by approximately $13.7 million or 38% during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. The Company executed amendments to the ABL Facility which extended the termination\ndate on the ABL Facility from September 15, 2023 to February 1, 2028 and increased the capacity of the ABL Facility\nfrom $125 million to $175 million. Additionally, the Company conducted the Notes Exchange Offer (as defined in Note 8\nof the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II) and issued approximately $181.4 million in 2025\nSenior Secured Notes to eligible holders whose 2024 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) were accepted for exchange\nin the Notes Exchange Offer on November 1, 2023. Following the Notes Exchange Offer, approximately $28.1 million\naggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes remained outstanding, which were subsequently redeemed on\nNovember 21, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, key drivers of financial performance included:\n• Increased consolidated revenue by $61.6 million or 12% compared to the year ended 2022 primarily due to\nadditional revenue generated from growth in the Government segment as well as an increase in customer demand\nin the HFS–South segment.\n• Increased revenue in the HFS–South segment by $16.3 million or 12% as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 as a result of an increase in customer demand.\n• Generated consolidated net income of approximately $173.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to a net income of approximately $73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase\nin net income is primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit driven by the increase in revenue, a decrease\nin costs of service, a decrease in interest expense driven by significant debt reduction as well as a decrease in the\n49\nestimated fair value of warrant liabilities, partially offset by an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt and an\nincrease in income tax expense due to improved results.\n• Generated consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $344.2 million representing an increase of $79.5 million or 30% as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022, driven primarily by the increase in revenue, and decrease in\ncosts of services as mentioned above, partially offset by an increase in specialty rental costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is Net income\n(loss). Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition and reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP\nmeasure.\nOur Government segment, including the South Texas Family Residential Center and several communities in West, Texas\nsupporting critical United States government humanitarian aid efforts, deliver essential services and accommodations near\nthe southern United States border where there is insufficient housing and infrastructure solutions to appropriately care for\nasylum-seeking families and unaccompanied minor immigrants. Demand for these communities and services is influenced\nby immigration activity, where continued increases in migrant populations has increased government spending and demand\nfor appropriate government supported solutions.\nOur proximity to customer activities influences occupancy and demand. We have built, own and operate the largest\nspecialty rental and hospitality services network available to customers operating in the HFS–South region. Our broad\nnetwork often results in us having communities that are the closest to our customers’ job sites, which reduces commute\ntimes and costs, and improves the overall safety of our customers’ workforce. Our communities provide customers with\ncost efficiencies, as they are able to jointly use our communities and related infrastructure (i.e., power, water, sewer and\nIT) services alongside other customers operating in the same vicinity. Demand for our services is dependent upon activity\nlevels, particularly our customers’ capital spending on natural resource development activities.\nFactors Affecting Results of Operations\nWe expect our business to continue to be affected by the key factors discussed below, as well as factors discussed in the\nsection titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and\ninformation currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available\ninformation prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nSupply and Demand for Natural Resources\nAs a provider of vertically integrated specialty rental and hospitality services, we are not directly impacted by commodity\nprice fluctuations. However, these price fluctuations indirectly influence our activities and results of operations because\nthe natural resource development workforce is directly affected by price fluctuations and the industry’s expansion or\ncontraction as a result of these fluctuations. Our occupancy volume depends on the size of the workforce within the natural\nresources industry and the demand for labor. Commodity prices are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond\nour control, including the domestic and global supply of and demand for natural resources, the commodities trading\nmarkets, as well as other supply and demand factors that may influence commodity prices.\nAvailability and Cost of Capital\nCapital markets conditions could affect our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets to the extent necessary to\nfund our future growth. Interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels,\ncausing our financing costs to increase accordingly, and could limit our ability to raise funds, or increase the price of\nraising funds, in the capital markets and may limit our ability to expand.\nRegulatory Compliance\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations\nconcerning matters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid, and hazardous waste handling and disposal and\n50\nthe investigation and remediation of contamination. In addition, we may be subject, indirectly, to various statutes and\nregulations applicable to doing business with the U.S. government as a result of our contracts with U.S. government\ncontractor clients. The risks of substantial costs, liabilities, and limitations on our operations related to compliance with\nthese laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business, and future conditions may develop, arise, or be discovered\nthat create substantial compliance or environmental remediation liabilities and costs.\nPublic Policy\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our subcontracts with government contractors. The U.S. government\nand, by extension, our U.S. government contractor customers, may from time to time adopt, implement or modify certain\npolicies or directives that may adversely affect our business. Changes in government policy, presidential administration or\nother changes in the political landscape relating to immigration policies may similarly result in a decline in our revenues\nin the Government segment.\nNatural Disasters or Other Significant Disruption\nAn operational disruption in any of our facilities could negatively impact our financial results. The occurrence of a natural\ndisaster, such as earthquake, tornado, severe weather including hail storms, flood, fire, or other unanticipated problems\nsuch as public health threats or outbreaks, labor difficulties, equipment failure, capacity expansion difficulties or\nunscheduled maintenance could cause operational disruptions of varied duration. These types of disruptions could\nmaterially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations to varying degrees dependent upon the facility,\nthe duration of the disruption, our ability to shift business to another facility or find alternative solutions.\nOverview of Our Revenue and Operations\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from specialty rental accommodations and vertically integrated hospitality services.\nApproximately 64.9% of our revenue was earned from specialty rental with vertically integrated hospitality services,\nspecifically lodging and related ancillary services, whereas the remaining 35.1% of revenues were earned through leasing\nof lodging facilities for the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue is recognized in the period in which lodging and\nservices are provided pursuant to the terms of contractual relationships with our customers. In certain of our contracts,\nrates may vary over the contract term, in these cases, revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the\ncontract term. We enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables for which arrangement consideration is allocated\nbetween lodging and services based on the relative estimated standalone selling price of each deliverable. The estimated\nprice of lodging and services deliverables is based on the prices of lodging and services when sold separately or based\nupon the best estimate of selling price.\nThe Company originated a contract in 2013 with TC Energy Pipelines to construct, deliver, cater and manage all\naccommodations and hospitality services in conjunction with the planned construction of the Keystone XL pipeline project.\nIn January 2021, the project was suspended due to the Keystone XL Presidential Permit being revoked. Then on July 23,\n2021, the Company executed the Termination and Settlement Agreement, which effectively terminated the Company’s\ncontract with TC Energy that was originated in 2013 and no further revenue will be generated from the contract with TC\nEnergy.\nKey Indicators of Financial Performance\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as\nsignificant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and intend to review these measurements frequently\nfor consistency and trend analysis. We primarily review the following profit and loss information when assessing our\nperformance:\nRevenue\nWe analyze our revenues by comparing actual revenues to our internal budgets and projections for a given period and to\nprior periods to assess our performance. We believe that revenues are a meaningful indicator of the demand and pricing\n51\nfor our services. Key drivers to change in revenues may include average utilization of existing beds, levels of development\nactivity in the HFS–South segment, the consumer price index impacting government contracts, and government spending\non housing programs.\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nWe analyze our adjusted gross profit, which is a Non-GAAP measure, which we define as revenues less cost of sales,\nexcluding impairment and depreciation of specialty rental assets to measure our financial performance. Please see\n“Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition and reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. We believe\nadjusted gross profit is a meaningful metric because it provides insight on financial performance of our revenue streams\nwithout consideration of company overhead. Additionally, using adjusted gross profit gives us insight on factors impacting\ncost of sales, such as efficiencies of our direct labor and material costs. When analyzing adjusted gross profit, we compare\nactual adjusted gross profit to our budgets and internal projections and to prior period results for a given period in order to\nassess our performance.\nWe also use Non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows to evaluate\nthe operating performance of our business. For a more in-depth discussion of the Non-GAAP measures, please refer to the\n“Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.\nSegments\nAs discussed in Note 20 (Business Segments) of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, during 2023 the Company reduced the number of reportable\nsegments from four to two as the additional two previously reportable segments (“TCPL Keystone” and “HFS–Midwest”)\nbecame quantitatively immaterial and are now combined in the “All Other” category for all periods presented.\nWe have identified two reportable business segments: HFS–South and Government:\nHFS–South\nThe HFS–South segment reflects our facilities and operations in the HFS–South region from customers in the natural\nresources development industry and includes our 16 communities located across Texas and New Mexico.\nGovernment\nThe Government segment includes the facilities and operations of the family residential center and the related support\ncommunities in Dilley, Texas (the “South Texas Family Residential Center”) provided under a lease and services\nagreement with a national provider of migrant programming (the “FRCC Partner”). Additionally, this segment also\nincludes facilities and operations provided under a lease and services agreement with our NP Partner, backed by a\ncommitted U.S. Government contract, to provide a suit of comprehensive service offerings in support of their humanitarian\naid efforts.\nAll Other\nOur other facilities and operations which do not meet the criteria to be a separate reportable segment are consolidated and\nreported as “All Other” which represents the facilities and operations of one community in Canada, three communities in\nNorth Dakota, and the catering and other services provided to communities and other workforce accommodation facilities\nfor the natural resource development industries not owned by us.\n52\nKey Factors Impacting the Comparability of Results\nThe historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either to each other or to our future\nresults of operations, for the reasons described below:\nTermination of the TCPL Keystone Contract\nIn January 2021, the TCPL project was suspended due to the Keystone XL Presidential Permit being revoked. Then on\nJuly 23, 2021, the Company executed the Termination and Settlement Agreement, which effectively terminated the\nCompany’s contract with TC Energy that was originated in 2013. As a result of the Termination and Settlement Agreement,\nno further activity is expected in the TCPL Keystone segment.\nGovernment Segment Growth\nA significant new contract was originated in the Government segment in March of 2021 with our NP Partner, backed by\na committed United States Government contract, to provide a suite of comprehensive service offerings in support of their\nhumanitarian aid efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company executed the Expanded Humanitarian\nContract to provide enhanced infrastructure and comprehensive facility services that support the critical hospitality\nsolutions the Company provides to the NP Partner and the U.S. Government in their humanitarian aid missions. The\nExpanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a significant scope expansion and term extension for the continuation of\nservices provided under the agreement that originated in March 2021. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract operated with\nsimilar structure to the Company’s prior and existing government services subcontracts, which are centered around\nminimum revenue commitments supported by the United States Government. Additionally, the Expanded Humanitarian\nContract included occupancy-based variable services revenue that aligned with active community population. The\nminimum revenue commitments, which consisted of annual recurring lease revenue and nonrecurring infrastructure\nenhancement revenue, provided for a minimum annual revenue contribution of approximately $390 million and was fully\ncommitted over its initial contract term. Inclusive of all potential occupancy-based variable services revenue, the Expanded\nHumanitarian Contract provided for a maximum initial annual total contract amount of approximately $575 million. On\nMay 15, 2023, the Company executed a six-month extension of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract, which extended the\nperiod of performance through November 15, 2023 and increased the contract value, with no change to contract structure\nor any other existing economic terms. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract terminated as of November 15, 2023. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, the Company executed the New PCC Contract, pursuant to an Indefinite Delivery,\nIndefinite Quantity Task Order between our NP Partner and the U.S. Government, that replaced the Expanded\nHumanitarian Contract and became effective on November 16, 2023. The New PCC Contract includes a one year base\nperiod through November 15, 2024, an option to extend for up to four additional one year periods, and an option to extend\nfor up to six months upon the conclusion of the base period or any of the option periods. Under the New PCC Contract,\nthe Company will maintain similar facility size and operational scope compared to the Expanded Humanitarian Contract.\nThe New PCC Contract operates with similar structure to the Company’s prior and existing government services\nsubcontracts, which are centered around minimum revenue commitments supported by the United States Government.\nAdditionally, the New PCC Contract includes occupancy-based variable services revenue that will align with active\ncommunity population. The minimum revenue commitments, which consist of annual recurring lease revenue, provide for\na minimum annual revenue contribution of approximately $178 million. Assuming all option periods are exercised, the 5-\nyear cumulative minimum revenue commitment of the New PCC Contract is expected to be approximately $892 million\nthrough 2028. Inclusive of the minimum revenue commitment and all potential occupancy-based variable services revenue,\nthe New PCC Contract provides for a maximum total contract amount of approximately $1.8 billion through 2028,\nassuming all option periods are exercised.\nResults of Operations\nThe period to period comparisons of our results of operations have been prepared using the historical periods included in\nour audited consolidated financial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document.\n53\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021($ in thousands):\nPercentage Percentage\nAmount of Change Amount of Change\nFor the Years Ended Increase Increase Increase Increase\nDecember 31, (Decrease) (Decrease) (Decrease) (Decrease)\nRevenues: 2023 2022 2021 2023 vs. 2022 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021 2022 vs. 2021\nServices income $ 365,627 $333,702 $203,134 $ 31,925 10% $ 130,568 64%\nSpecialty rental income 197,981 168,283 76,909 29,698 18% 91,374 119%\nConstruction fee income - - 11,294 - 0% (11,294) (100)%\nTotal revenues 563,608 501,985 291,337 61,623 12% 210,648 72%\nCosts:\nServices 151,574 174,200 120,192 (22,626) (13)% 54,008 45%\nSpecialty rental 30,084 27,824 16,186 2,260 8% 11,638 72%\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets 68,626 52,833 53,609 15,793 30% (776) (1)%\nGross profit 313,324 247,128 101,350 66,196 27% 145,778 144%\nSelling, general and administrative 56,126 57,893 46,461 (1,767) (3)% 11,432 25%\nOther depreciation and amortization 15,351 14,832 16,910 519 3% (2,078) (12)%\nOther expense, net 1,241 36 880 1,205 3347% (844) (96)%\nOperating income 240,606 174,367 37,099 66,239 38% 137,268 370%\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 2,279 - - 2,279 100% - 0%\nInterest expense, net 22,639 36,323 38,704 (13,684) (38)% (2,381) (6)%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (9,062) 31,735 1,067 (40,797) (129)% 30,668 2874%\nIncome (loss) before income tax 224,750 106,309 (2,672) 118,441 111% 108,981 (4,079)%\nIncome tax expense 51,050 32,370 1,904 18,680 58% 30,466 1600%\nNet income (loss) $ 173,700 $ 73,939 $ (4,576) $ 99,761 135% $ 78,515 (1,716)%\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nTotal Revenue. Total revenue was $563.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $502.0 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, and consisted of $365.6 million of services income and $198.0 million of specialty\nrental income. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of $333.7 million of services income and\n$168.3 million of specialty rental income.\nServices income consists primarily of specialty rental and vertically integrated and comprehensive hospitality services\nincluding catering and food services, maintenance, housekeeping, grounds-keeping, security, overall workforce\ncommunity management services, health and recreation facilities, concierge services, and laundry service. The main\ndrivers of the increase in services income revenue year over year was the growth in the Government segment, primarily\nfrom fixed minimum contractual revenue commitments that are unaffected by changes in occupancy, combined with a\ncontinued increase in customer activity in the HFS–South segment as well as a slight increase in the All Other segment.\nSpecialty rental income consists primarily of revenues from leasing rooms and other facilities at certain communities that\ninclude contractual arrangements with customers that are considered leases under the authoritative accounting guidance\nfor leases. Specialty rental income increased primarily as a result of growth in the Government segment.\nCost of services. Cost of services was $151.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $174.2 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in services costs is primarily due to a decrease in services costs in\nthe Government segment driven by a decrease in occupancy, partially offset by an increase in service costs in the\nHFS–South segment driven by the increase in customer activity mentioned above, which also led to more communities in\noperation during the current period, including a new community acquired in January 2023 to support growth in the\nHFS–South segment. This increase in services costs was also partially driven by communities in the All Other category\nfrom an increase in customer activity.\nSpecialty rental costs. Specialty rental costs were approximately $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as\ncompared to $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in specialty rental costs is primarily due\nto an increase in costs related to growth in the Government segment.\n54\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets. Depreciation of specialty rental assets was $68.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 as compared to $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in depreciation\nexpense is primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation on specialty rental assets acquired in 2022 to support growth\nof the Government segment related to the Expanded Humanitarian Contract.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative was $56.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 as compared to $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in selling, general\nand administrative expenses of $1.8 million was primarily driven by a decrease in stock compensation expense of\napproximately $8 million largely from the liability-based stock appreciation right awards (“SARs”) led primarily by\nvesting and exercises of approximately 50% of the prior period outstanding awards that occurred during March 2023,\nwhich reduced the number of liability-based SAR awards outstanding in the current year and generated lower expense,\nwhile a portion of this decrease was driven by a reduction in the estimated value of the SARs year over year. This was\npartially offset by a $4.6 million increase in transaction fees led by the Notes Exchange Offer, and a $1.3 million increase\nin insurance expense driven by growth of the business.\nOther depreciation and amortization. Other depreciation and amortization expense was $15.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 as compared to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in other depreciation\nand amortization is primarily driven by an increase in depreciation associated with an increase in finance leases.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to less than\n$0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase in expense is primarily driven by costs incurred on the\ndisposal of assets in the All Other segment category in the current period.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023\nas compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in loss on extinguishment of debt is primarily due\nto the partial redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on March 15, 2023, which was accounted for as a partial\nextinguishment of debt and resulted in a charge of approximately $1.7 million related to the write-off of unamortized\ndeferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount. Approximately $0.4 million of the change related to the\nwrite-off of unamortized deferred financing costs for non-continuing lenders in connection with the First Amendment to\nthe ABL Facility on February 1, 2023. The remainder of the change relates to the write-off of approximately $0.2 million\nof the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount associated with the\nredemption on November 21, 2023 of the remaining portion of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes that were not exchanged\nfor the new 2025 Senior Secured Notes in the Notes Exchange Offer. Refer to Note 8 of the notes to our audited\nconsolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion\nregarding extinguishment of debt and the Notes Exchange Offer.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to\ninterest expense, net of $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in interest expense, net was\nprimarily driven by a decrease in interest expense on the Senior Secured Notes driven by a lower average outstanding debt\nbalance in current year compared to the prior year as approximately $153.1 million of the Senior Secured Notes were paid\noff during the year ended December 31, 2023, whereas approximately $5.5 million of the Senior Secured Notes were\nrepaid during the year ended December 31, 2022. This change in interest expense was also partially driven by lower interest\nexpense associated with the ABL Facility as it had no outstanding balance in the current year compared to an average\noutstanding balance in the prior year. Approximately $2.6 million of this decrease was driven by interest income earned\non cash equivalents funded by the increase in available cash due to growth of the business, led by the Government segment.\nThese decreases were partially offset by approximately $1.0 million of interest that was capitalized during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 in connection with capital project activity driven by the expansion in the Government segment\nassociated with the Expanded Humanitarian Contract. Interest was not capitalized during the year ended December 31,\n2023 as there were no such expansion activities during that period.\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities represents the fair value adjustments\nto the outstanding Private Warrant liabilities based on the change in their estimated fair value at each reporting period end.\nThe change in fair value of the warrant liabilities was ($9.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared\n55\nto $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities is the result\nof changes in market prices deriving the value of the financial instruments. The estimated value of the Private Warrants\ndecreased in the current year, generating an increase to income in the current year. There was also a lower number of\naverage outstanding Private Warrants throughout the current year compared to the prior year as a result of the Warrant\nExchange that closed on December 22, 2022 as discussed in Note 17 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial\nstatements in Part II, Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense was $51.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to\n$32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in income tax expense is primarily attributable to an\nincrease in income before income tax as well as an increase in state tax expense based off of gross receipts as a result of\nthe increase in revenues due to improvements in overall operations and growth in the business from the Government\nsegment.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nFor discussion of the comparison of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, please read\nthe “Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021” section located in the Management Discussion & Analysis\nsection in our Annual Report on From 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed on March 10, 2023 and is\nincorporated herein by reference.\nSegment Results\nThe following table sets forth our selected results of operations for each of our reportable segments for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 ($ in thousands, except for Average Daily Rate amounts).\nPercentage Percentage\nAmount of Change Amount of Change\nFor the Years Ended Increase Increase Increase Increase\nDecember 31, (Decrease) (Decrease) (Decrease) (Decrease)\n2023 vs. 2023 vs. 2022 vs. 2022 vs.\nRevenue: 2023 2022 2021 2022 2022 2021 2021\nGovernment $ 403,724 $360,294 $156,250 $ 43,430 12% $ 204,044 131%\nHFS–South 148,677 132,373 116,958 16,304 12% 15,415 13%\nAll Other 11,207 9,318 18,129 1,889 20% (8,811) (49)%\nTotal revenues $ 563,608 $501,985 $291,337 $ 61,623 12% $ 210,648 72%\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nGovernment $ 332,480 $246,598 $ 94,801 $ 85,882 35% $ 151,797 160%\nHFS–South 51,444 54,558 52,344 (3,114) (6)% 2,214 4%\nAll Other (1,974) (1,195) 7,814 (779) 65% (9,009) (115)%\nTotal Adjusted Gross Profit $ 381,950 $299,961 $154,959 $ 81,989 27% $ 145,002 94%\nAverage Daily Rate\nHFS–South $ 75.22 $ 73.39 $ 74.64 $ 1.83 $ (1.25)\nNote: Adjusted gross profit for the chief operating decision maker’s (“CODM”) analysis includes the services and rental\ncosts recognized in the financial statements and excludes depreciation on specialty rental assets, certain severance costs,\nand loss on impairment.

This increase in revenue was also driven by an increase in average daily rate.\nThe decrease in adjusted gross profit of approximately $3.2 million was primarily attributable to asset mobilization and\nintegration costs associated with the new community acquired in January 2023, and partially driven by an increase in\noccupancy and customer activity as mentioned above, which drove more variable cost. This decrease was partially offset\nby an increase in average daily rate.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nFor discussion of the comparison of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, please read\nthe “Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021” section located in the Management Discussion & Analysis\nsection in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed on March 10, 2023 and is\nincorporated herein by reference.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe depend on cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our ABL Facility to finance our acquisition\nstrategy, working capital needs, and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2023, the ABL Facility had unused available\nborrowing capacity of $175 million. We currently believe that our cash on hand, along with these sources of funds will\nprovide sufficient liquidity to fund debt service requirements, support our growth, acquisition, and diversification strategy\ndiscussed in Item 1, “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, lease obligations, contingent liabilities and working\ncapital investments for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain future\ndebt or equity financings adequate for our future cash requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient, we may be forced to reduce or delay additional acquisitions, future\ninvestments and capital expenditures, and seek additional capital. Significant delays in our ability to finance planned\nacquisitions or capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects.\nWe continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that any such acquisition may require us to\nincur additional debt to finance the acquisition and/or to issue shares of our Common Stock or other equity securities as\nacquisition consideration or as part of an overall financing plan. We will continue to evaluate alternatives to optimize our\ncapital structure, which could include the issuance or repurchase of additional unsecured and secured debt, equity securities\nand/or equity-linked securities. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance or repurchase. From time\nto time, we may also seek to streamline our capital structure and improve our financial position through refinancing or\nrestructuring our existing debt or retiring certain of our securities for cash or other consideration. For additional discussion\nof risks related to our liquidity and capital resources, refer to the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I Item 1A of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n57\nCapital Requirements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred approximately $65.6 million in capital expenditures, which\ndecreased by approximately $75.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 as the prior period included\ngrowth projects to increase community capacity, mainly in the Government segment, which was largely completed in the\nprior year. Our total annual 2023 capital spending, excluding acquired intangibles, was largely driven by growth capital\nexpenditures in the HFS-South segment, with approximately $30.4 million driven by capital expenditures in the\nGovernment segment. In 2021, capital expenditures incurred increased from 2020. This increase was primarily driven by\ngrowth in the Government segment and maintenance capital expenditures that were delayed in 2020 to conserve cash.\nAlthough growth capital expenditures are largely discretionary, our long-lived specialty rental assets require a certain level\nof maintenance capital expenditures, which have ranged from approximately 0.4% to 4.0% of annual revenue between\n2019 and 2023, with an average cost of approximately 2% of annual revenue. Maintenance capital expenditures for\nspecialty rental assets amounted to approximately $14.2 million, $12.3 million, and $11.7 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As we pursue growth, we monitor which capital resources, including\nequity and debt financings, are available to us to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure\nactivities and liquidity requirements. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the ability\nto maintain existing contracts, obtain new contracts and manage our operating expenses. The failure to achieve anticipated\nrevenue and cash flows from operations could result in a reduction in future capital spending. We cannot assure you that\noperations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event we make additional\nacquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time,\nwe could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures or seek additional capital. We cannot assure you\nthat needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe following table sets forth general information derived from our audited consolidated statements of cash flows:\nFor the Years Ende d\n($ in thousands) December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 156,801 $ 305,612 $ 104,599\nNet cash used in investing activities (68,180) (140,228) (35,915)\nNet cash used in financing activities (166,369) (7,098) (52,271)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 4 (19) 14\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (77,744) $ 158,267 $ 16,427\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nCash flows provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $156.8 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023 compared to $305.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease in net cash\nprovided by operating activities relates primarily to a decrease in cash collection from customers of approximately\n$156.5 million led by the prior period including a significant $194 million upfront payment for expansion efforts related\nto the Expanded Humanitarian Contract, which did not recur in the current period, and an increase in cash paid for income\ntaxes of approximately $1.1 million. These net operating cash flow decreases were partially offset by a decrease in interest\npayments of approximately $3.4 million driven by lower debt, an increase in interest received of approximately\n$2.5 million, and a net decrease in cash payments for operating expenses and payroll of approximately $3.2 million driven\nby a decrease in operating expenses from the Government segment as a result of lower occupancy, which drove lower\nvariable operating expenses, partially offset by growth and recovery of the business as well as the cash payments for vested\nSAR awards made during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCash flows used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $68.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to $140.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease in net cash used in\ninvesting activities was primarily related to a decrease in growth capital expenditures in the Government segment\ncompared to the prior period. The prior period included expansion related activities associated with the Expanded\nHumanitarian Contract that became effective on May 16, 2022 and drove a significant amount of capital expenditure spend,\n58\nwhich was largely incurred and paid by the end of the third quarter in 2022 as the Company received the upfront payment\nfor the construction in August 2022. This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an increase\nin growth capital expenditures in the HFS–South segment with the largest single driver being the $18.6 million acquisition\nof community assets and related intangibles in January 2023, supporting continued customer demand. To a lesser extent,\nthe net decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $5.0 million acquisition of community\nassets in April 2023 and $1.3 million worth of land acquisitions during 2023, supporting Government segment growth.\nCash flows used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $166.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net cash used in\nfinancing activities was driven primarily by approximately $153.1 million of combined repayments related to the 2024\nSenior Secured Notes on March 15, 2023 and November 21, 2023, whereas the prior period only included an elective\n$5.5 million repayment of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. The current period had payment of deferred financing costs of\napproximately $5.2 million associated with the First Amendment and Third Amendment to the ABL Facility on February\n1, 2023 and October 12, 2023, respectively, and the issuance of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes on November 1, 2023 in\nconnection with the Notes Exchange Offer, whereas the prior period had no such payments. The increase in net cash used\nin financing activities was also driven by an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of\napproximately $6.7 million, an increase in payment of accrued issuance costs from the warrant exchange that closed on\nDecember 22, 2022 of approximately $0.7 million, and increased principal payments on vehicle finance leases of\napproximately $0.4 million. These increases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by higher cash\nproceeds in the current period from the issuance of Common Stock from the exercise of warrants and options of\napproximately $1.3 million.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nFor discussion of the comparison of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, please read\nthe “Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021” section located in the Management Discussion & Analysis\nsection in the our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed on March 10, 2023 and is\nincorporated herein by reference.\nIndebtedness\nThe Company’s finance lease and other financing obligations as of December 31, 2023 consisted of $2.4 million of finance\nleases. The finance leases pertain to leases entered into during 2019 through 2023, for commercial-use vehicles with\n36-month terms (and continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter) expiring through 2026. Refer to Notes 1, 8, and 13\nof the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 within this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further discussion regarding finance leases.\nThe Company’s finance lease and other financing obligations as of December 31, 2022, consisted of approximately\n$2.2 million of finance leases related to commercial-use vehicles with the same terms as described above.\nABL Facility\nOn March 15, 2019, as amended on February 1, 2023, August 10, 2023, and October 12, 2023, Topaz, Arrow Bidco,\nTarget, Signor and each of their domestic subsidiaries entered into an ABL credit agreement that provides for a senior\nsecured asset-based revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $175 million (the “ABL Facility”)\nwith a termination date of February 1, 2028, which termination date is subject to a springing maturity that will accelerate\nthe maturity of the ABL Facility if any of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding on the date that is ninety-\none days prior to the stated maturity date thereof. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repaid a net\namount of $48 million of borrowings under the ABL Facility from excess cash available, which reduced the outstanding\nbalance to $0 as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $70 million was drawn and $70 million\nwas repaid on the ABL Facility resulting in an outstanding balance of $0 as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, no amounts were drawn or repaid on the ABL Facility resulting in an outstanding balance of $0 as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Refer to Note 8 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements located in Part II, Item 8\nwithin this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the ABL Facility.\n59\nSenior Secured Notes\nOn March 15, 2019, Arrow Bidco issued $340 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.50% senior secured notes due\nMarch 15, 2024 (the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”) under an indenture dated March 15, 2019 (the “2024 Notes\nIndenture”). The 2024 Notes Indenture was entered into by and among Arrow Bidco, the guarantors named therein (the\n“2024 Senior Secured Note Guarantors”), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee and as collateral agent.\nInterest was payable semi-annually on September 15 and March 15 and began September 15, 2019. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company made an elective repayment of approximately $5.5 million on the 2024 Senior Secured\nNotes, reducing the principal balance outstanding to $334.5 million from an original principal balance of $340 million.\nOn March 15, 2023, Arrow Bidco redeemed $125 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2024 Senior\nSecured Notes. The redemption was accounted for as a partial extinguishment of debt. In connection with the Notes\nExchange Offer, on November 1, 2023 (the “Notes Exchange Offer Settlement Date”), approximately $181.4 million of\n2024 Senior Secured Notes were exchanged by Arrow Bidco and Arrow Bidco issued approximately $181.4 million in\naggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an indenture, dated November 1, 2023, by and\namong Arrow Bidco, the guarantors from time to time party thereto and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as\ntrustee and collateral agent (the “2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture”). Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15\nand September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2024. Following this issuance and related transactions, approximately\n$28.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes remained outstanding, which were subsequently\nredeemed on November 21, 2023 resulting in an outstanding balance of $0 as of December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 8 of\nthe notes to our audited consolidated financial statements located in Part II, Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for additional discussion of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Exchange Offer, and the 2025 Senior Secured\nNotes.\nCash requirements\nWe expect that our principal short-term (over the next 12 months) and long-term needs for cash relating to our operations\nwill be to primarily fund (i) operating activities and working capital, (ii) maintenance capital expenditures for specialty\nrental assets, (iii) payments due under finance and operating leases, and (iv) debt service interest payments. We plan to\nfund such cash requirements from our existing sources of liquidity as previously discussed. The table below presents\ninformation on payments coming due under the most significant categories of our needs for cash (excluding operating cash\nflows pertaining to normal business operations, other than operating lease obligations) as of December 31, 2023 ($ in\nthousands):\nTotal 2024 2025 2026 2027\nInterest Payments(1) $ 31,696 $ 17,067 $ 14,629 $ — $ —\n2025 Senior Secured Notes 181,446 — 181,446 — —\nOperating lease obligations, including imputed\ninterest(2) 21,838 12,518 5,429 3,283 608\nTotal $ 234,980 $ 29,585 $ 201,504 $ 3,283 $ 608\n(1) We will incur and pay interest expense at 10.75% of the face value of $181.4 million annually, or $19.5 million in\nconnection with our 2025 Senior Secured Notes due June 15, 2025. Over the remaining term of the 2025 Senior\nSecured Notes, interest payments total approximately $31.7 million, which includes any accrued interest due at the\nmaturity date.\n(2) Represents interest on operating lease obligations calculated using the appropriate discount rate for each lease as noted\nin Note 13 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements located in Part II, Item 8 within this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“US GAAP”). A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 1 of the notes to our\naudited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\n60\nfollowing section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies involving estimates or assumptions that\n(1) involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and (2) have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact\non our financial condition or results of operations. It is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions\ncould result in materially different amounts being reported in our consolidated final statements. While reviewing this\nsection, refer to Note 1 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 within this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, including terms defined herein.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor contracts that contain both a lease component and a services or non-lease component, the Company adopted an\naccounting policy to account for and present the lease component under ASC 842 and the non-lease component under\nASC 606. With respect to ASC 842, when estimating a customer’s lease term, the Company uses judgment in\ncontemplating the significance of: any penalties a customer may incur should it choose not to exercise any existing options\nto extend the lease or exercise any existing options to terminate the lease; and economic incentives to the customer in the\nlease. Factors the Company considers in making this assessment include the uniqueness of the purpose or location of the\nproperty, the availability of a comparable replacement property, the relative importance or significance of the property to\nthe continuation of the lessee’s line of business and the existence of customer leasehold improvements or other assets\nwhose value would be impaired by the customer vacating or discontinuing use of the leased property. With respect to\nASC 606, when estimating the contract term where an extension option is present, the Company uses judgment in\ndetermining whether the extension option contains a material right under ASC 606. An over-estimate of the term of the\nlease by management could result in the write-off of any recorded assets associated with rental revenue and acceleration\nof depreciation and amortization expense associated with costs we incurred related to the lease. Additionally, an over or\nunder-estimate of the contract term could result in revenue not being recognized in the proper period as well as revenue\nbeing under recognized, including for any significant advance payments for future services. The Company had no\nsignificant contracts with lease terms or contract terms determined to have been over or under-estimated during the\nreporting periods included herein.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nRefer to Note 1 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 within this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for a discussion of principles of consolidation.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 within this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for our assessment of recently issued and adopted accounting standards.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have included Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows which are\nmeasurements not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, in the discussion of our financial results because they are key\nmetrics used by management to assess financial performance. Our business is capital-intensive and these additional metrics\nallow management to further evaluate our operating performance.\nTarget Hospitality defines Adjusted gross profit, as gross profit plus depreciation of specialty rental assets, loss on\nimpairment, and certain severance costs.\nTarget Hospitality defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt,\nincome tax expense (benefit), depreciation of specialty rental assets, and other depreciation and amortization.\n61\nAdjusted EBITDA reflects the following further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect\nof what management considers transactions or events not related to its core business operations:\n• Other expense, net: Other expense, net includes miscellaneous cash receipts, gains and losses on disposals\nof property, plant, and equipment, COVID-19 related expenses, and other immaterial expenses and non-cash\nitems.\n• Transaction expenses: Target Hospitality incurred certain transaction costs during 2021, 2022 and 2023,\nincluding legal and professional fees, associated with the Proposal (previously defined in the Item 7.\nManagement Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed on March 10, 2023 and is\nincorporated herein by reference) and Warrant restatement in 2021, legal, advisory and underwriter fees,\nassociated with debt related transaction activity and other business development project related transaction\nactivity in 2023 as well as other immaterial items in 2022.\n• Stock-based compensation: Charges associated with stock-based compensation expense, which has been,\nand will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an\nimportant part of our compensation strategy.\n• Change in fair value of warrant liabilities: Non-cash change in estimated fair value of warrant liabilities.\n• Other adjustments: System implementation costs, including primarily non-cash amortization of capitalized\nsystem implementation costs, claim settlement, business development, accounting standard implementation\ncosts and certain severance costs.\nWe define Discretionary cash flows as cash flows from operations less maintenance capital expenditures for specialty\nrental assets.\nEBITDA reflects net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt, provision\nfor income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating\nperformance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business.\nWe also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors, and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain\nitems that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest\nexpense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of\ninterest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary\nbecause of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in\nwhich they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies.\nEBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense, because companies utilize productive assets of different\nages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in\nconsiderable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among\ncompanies.\nTarget Hospitality also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted\nEBITDA reflects adjustments to exclude the effects of additional items, including certain items, that are not reflective of\nthe ongoing operating results of Target Hospitality. In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude gains or losses\non the sale and disposal of depreciable assets and impairment losses because including them in EBITDA is inconsistent\nwith reporting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets. Additionally, the gain or loss on sale and disposal of\ndepreciable assets and impairment losses represents either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous\nperiods, and depreciation is excluded from EBITDA.\nTarget Hospitality also presents Discretionary cash flows because we believe it provides useful information regarding our\nbusiness as more fully described below. Discretionary cash flows indicate the amount of cash available after maintenance\ncapital expenditures for specialty rental assets for, among other things, investments in our existing business.\nAdjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows are not measurements of Target\nHospitality’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to gross profit, net income\n62\n(loss) or other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating\nactivities as measures of Target Hospitality’s liquidity. Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and\nDiscretionary cash flows should not be considered as discretionary cash available to Target Hospitality to reinvest in the\ngrowth of our business or as measures of cash that is available to it to meet our obligations. In addition, the measurement\nof Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows may not be comparable to similarly\ntitled measures of other companies. Target Hospitality’s management believe that Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA,\nAdjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows provide useful information to investors about Target Hospitality and its\nfinancial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) they are among the measures used by Target\nHospitality’s management team to evaluate its operating performance; (ii) they are among the measures used by Target\nHospitality’s management team to make day-to-day operating decisions, (iii) they are frequently used by securities\nanalysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results across companies in\nTarget Hospitality’s industry.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Target Hospitality’s consolidated gross profit to Adjusted gross profit:\nFor the Years Ende d\n($ in thousands) December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nGross Profit $ 313,324 $ 247,128 $ 101,350\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets 68,626 52,833 53,609\nAdjusted gross profit $ 381,950 $ 299,961 $ 154,959\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Target Hospitality’s consolidated net income (loss) to EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nFor the Years Ende d\n($ in thousands) December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income (loss) $ 173,700 $ 73,939 $ (4,576)\nIncome tax expense 51,050 32,370 1,904\nInterest expense, net 22,639 36,323 38,704\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 2,279 - -\nOther depreciation and amortization 15,351 14,832 16,910\nDepreciation of specialty rental assets 68,626 52,833 53,609\nEBITDA 333,645 210,297 106,551\nAdjustments\nOther expense, net 1,241 36 878\nTransaction expenses 4,875 283 1,198\nStock-based compensation 11,174 19,121 5,082\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (9,062) 31,735 1,067\nOther adjustments 2,344 3,242 4,400\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 344,217 $ 264,714 $ 119,176\n63\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Target Hospitality’s Net cash provided by operating activities to\nDiscretionary cash flows:\nFor the Years Ended\n($ in thousands) December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 156,801 $ 305,612 $ 104,599\nLess: Maintenance capital expenditures for specialty rental assets (14,218) (12,314) (11,659)\nDiscretionary cash flows $ 142,583 $ 293,298 $ 92,940\nPurchase of specialty rental assets (60,808) (120,287) (35,488)\nPurchase of property, plant and equipment (3,066) (20,556) (427)\nAcquired intangible assets (4,547) — —\nProceeds from sale of specialty rental assets and other property, plant\nand equipment 241 615 —\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (68,180) $ (140,228) $ (35,915)\nPrincipal payments on finance and finance lease obligations (1,404) (1,008) (4,172)\nPrincipal payments on borrowings from ABL — (70,000) (76,000)\nProceeds from borrowings on ABL — 70,000 28,000\nRepayment of Senior Notes (153,054) (5,500) —\nPayment of issuance costs from warrant exchange (1,504) (774) —\nProceeds from issuance of Common Stock from exercise of warrants 209 80 —\nProceeds from issuance of Common Stock from exercise of stock\noptions 1,396 225 —\nPayment of deferred financing costs (5,194) — —\nTaxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards (6,818) (121) (99)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (166,369) $ (7,098) $ (52,271)\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur principal market risks are our exposure to interest rates and commodity risks.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk through our ABL Facility which is subject to the risk of higher interest charges\nassociated with increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, we had $0 of outstanding floating-rate obligations\nunder our credit facilities. These floating-rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event\nof increases in short-term interest rates. If floating interest rates increased by 100 basis points, our consolidated interest\nexpense would not be impacted, however, based on our floating-rate debt obligations, which had no outstanding balances\nas December 31, 2023.\nCommodity Risk\nCommodity price fluctuations also indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term because\nthey may affect production rates and investments by natural resource development companies in the development of\ncommodity reserves.\nWe have limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices. However, both our profitability\nand our cash flows are affected by volatility in commodity prices. We do not currently hedge our exposure to commodity\nprices.\n64\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTABLE OF CONTENTS Page\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm(PCAOB ID:42) 66\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 68\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) 69\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’Equity 70\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 71\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 72\n65\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Target Hospitality Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Target Hospitality Corp. (the Company) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related\nnotes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 13, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex\njudgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\nDetermination of Expected Lease End Date for the Expanded Humanitarian Contract\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue recognized for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, included approximately $118.2 million of revenue from\nthe amortization of the advanced payment associated with the Expanded Humanitarian\nContract with the NP Partner. The advanced payment was amortized over the estimated\nterm of the contract ending November 2023. The term ending November 2023 included\nan extension option that the Company concluded to be reasonably certain of exercise.\nApproximately $62.5 million of the $118.2 million of revenue was recognized\n66\nas services income under Topic 606, while approximately $55.7 million of the\n$118.2 million of revenue was recognized as specialty rental income under ASC 842. In\nMay 2023, the NP Partner Expanded Humanitarian Contract was modified to include an\nadditional extension option, through May 2024. The Company concluded the additional\nlease extension was not reasonably certain of exercise and continued to recognize the\nadvance payment as revenue over the term ending November 2023.\nAuditing management’s determination of the expected lease end date was complex due to\nthe judgmental nature of assumptions used by management in assessing whether the NP\nPartner was reasonably certain to exercise the May 2023 extension option, including\njudgment in contemplating the significance of any penalties the NP Partner may have\nincurred should it have chosen not to exercise the extension option. Auditing this assessment\nrequired a higher degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing\nprocedures and evaluating evidence relating to the determination of the expected lease end\ndate.\nHow We Addressed the To test management’s determination of the expected lease end date we performed audit\nMatter in Our Audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of significant\njudgments utilized by management in determining whether the NP Partner was reasonably\ncertain to exercise the May 2023 extension option. For example, we evaluated whether the\nunamortized portion of the advanced payment represented a penalty to the NP Partner\nshould it have chosen not to exercise the May 2023 extension option, and whether that\npenalty affected the conclusion regarding whether the NP Partner was reasonably certain to\nexercise the extension option.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 13, 2024\n67\nItem 8.

Organization and Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Nature of Operations\nTarget Hospitality Corp. (“Target Hospitality” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) was formed on March\n15, 2019 and is one of North America’s largest providers of vertically integrated specialty rental and value-added\nhospitality services. The Company provides vertically integrated specialty rental and comprehensive hospitality services\nincluding: catering and food services, maintenance, housekeeping, grounds-keeping, security, health and recreation\nservices, overall workforce community management, and laundry service. Target Hospitality serves clients in natural\nresources development and government sectors principally located in the West Texas, South Texas, New Mexico, and\nMidwest regions.\nThe Company, whose securities are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries,\nTopaz Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Topaz”), and Arrow Bidco, LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company (“Arrow Bidco”), serve as the holding companies for the businesses of Target Logistics Management,\nLLC and its subsidiaries (“Target” or “TLM”) and RL Signor Holdings, LLC (“Signor”). TDR Capital LLP (“TDR\nCapital” or “TDR”) indirectly owns approximately 64% of Target Hospitality and the remaining ownership is broken out\namong the founders of the Company’s legal predecessor, Platinum Eagle Acquisition Corp. (“Platinum Eagle” or\n“PEAC”), investors who purchased the shares of Platinum Eagle in a private placement transaction, and other public\nshareholders.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared on the accrual basis of\naccounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions by\nmanagement in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities\nat the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. If the underlying estimates and assumptions upon which the financial statements are based change in future periods,\nactual amounts may differ from those included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries that it controls\ndue to ownership of a majority voting interest. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the\ndate on which the Company obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The\nfinancial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions are eliminated.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash\nequivalents.\n72\nReceivables and Allowances for Credit Losses\nReceivables primarily consist of amounts due from customers from the delivery of specialty rental services. The trade\naccounts receivable is recorded net of an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is based upon the\namount of losses expected to be incurred in the collection of these accounts pursuant to the guidance outlined in\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (ASU 2016-13, Topic 326, or ASC 326), which the Company adopted\neffective January 1, 2023 as further discussed in the “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” section of this Note. The\nestimated losses are calculated using the loss rate method based upon a review of outstanding receivables, including\nspecific accounts, related aging, and on historical collection experience. These allowances reflect our estimate of the\namount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. Our estimate could require a change\nbased on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the circumstances of individual customers. In\naddition, specific accounts are written off against the allowance when management determines the account is uncollectible.\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses was as follows:\nYea rs E nded December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBalances at Beginning of Year $ 4 $ 43 $ 2,977\nAdoption of ASC 326 268 - -\nProvision for credit losses 599 1,052 1,877\nRecoveries (55) (645) (247)\nWrite-offs (266) (446) (4,564)\nBalances at End of Year $ 550 $ 4 $ 43\nProvision for credit losses, net of recoveries for the period are included within selling, general and administrative expenses\nin the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses of approximately $5.5 million and $8.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily\nconsist of insurance, taxes, rent, deposits and permits. Prepaid insurance, rent, and permits are amortized over the related\nterm of the respective agreements. Prepaid taxes are recognized as expense over the related future tax period. Other assets\nof approximately $4 million and $3.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily consist of\n$1.9 million and $1.9 million of deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $2.1 million and\n$2.0 million of hospitality inventory as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Inventory, primarily consisting of\nfood and beverages, is accounted for by the first-in, first-out method and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable\nvalue.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nIn the normal course of business, the Company grants credit to its customers based on credit evaluations of their financial\ncondition and generally requires no collateral or other security. Major customers are defined as those individually\ncomprising more than 10.0% of the Company’s revenues or accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nthe Company had one customer who accounted for 62% of revenues. The largest customer accounted for 45% of accounts\nreceivable, while no other customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31,\n2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two customers representing 60.6% and 11.1% of total revenues,\nrespectively. The largest customers accounted for 12% and 11% of accounts receivable, respectively, at December 31,\n2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had two customers representing 34.7% and 18.9% of total revenues,\nrespectively.\n73\nMajor suppliers are defined as those individually comprising more than 10.0% of the annual goods purchased. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company had one major supplier representing 16.8%, 13.4%, and\n15.3% of goods purchased, respectively.\nWe provide services almost entirely to customers in the government and natural resource development sectors and as such,\nare almost entirely dependent upon the continued activity of such customers.\nInterest Capitalization\nInterest costs for the construction of certain long-term assets are capitalized by applying the weighted average interest rate\napplicable to the borrowings of the Company to the average amount of accumulated expenditures outstanding during the\nconstruction period. Such capitalized interest costs are depreciated over the related assets’ estimated useful lives.\nSpecialty Rental Assets\nSpecialty rental assets (units, site work and furniture and fixtures comprising lodges) are measured at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.\nCosts of improvements and betterments to units are capitalized when such costs extend the useful life of the unit or increase\nthe rental value of the unit. Costs incurred for units to meet a particular customer specification are capitalized and\ndepreciated over the lease term. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives and considering the residual value of\nthose assets. The estimated useful life of modular units is 15 years. The estimated useful life of site work (above ground\nand below ground infrastructure) is 5 years. The estimated useful life of furniture and fixtures is 7 years. Assets leased\nunder finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain\nthat the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual\nvalues are adjusted prospectively, if a revision is determined to be appropriate.\nOther Property, Plant, and Equipment\nOther property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Assets\nleased under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives unless it is reasonably\ncertain that the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. Maintenance and\nrepair costs are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, as follows:\nBuildings 5-15 years\nMachinery and office equipment 3-5 years\nFurniture and fixtures 7 years\nSoftware 3 years\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Consideration transferred for acquisitions is\nmeasured at fair value at the acquisition date and includes assets transferred, liabilities assumed and equity issued.\nAcquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. When the Company\nacquires a business, the financial assets and liabilities assumed are assessed for appropriate classification and designation\nin accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date.\n74\nAny contingent consideration transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Any subsequent\nchanges to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in profit or loss. If the contingent consideration is\nclassified as equity, it is not re-measured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.\nGoodwill\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the\noperating segment, or one level below that operating segment (the component level) if discrete financial information is\nprepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. However, components are aggregated as a single reporting unit\nif they have similar economic characteristics. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business\ncombination is allocated to each of the Company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the combination. The\nCompany evaluates changes in its reporting structure to assess whether that change impacts the composition of one or\nmore of its reporting units. If the composition of the Company’s reporting units’ changes, goodwill is reassigned between\nreporting units using the relative fair value allocation approach.\nThe Company performs the annual impairment test of goodwill at October 1. In addition, the Company performs\nimpairment tests during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may\nhave occurred. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is\nthe case, the Company then performs a quantitative impairment test. Otherwise, the quantitative impairment test is not\nrequired. Under the quantitative impairment test, the Company would compare the estimated fair value of each reporting\nunit to its carrying value.\nIn assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the Company considers the market approach, the income approach, or a\ncombination of both. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices of\ncompanies comparable to the reporting unit being valued. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit\nis based on the present value of estimated cash flows. The income approach is dependent on several significant\nmanagement assumptions, including estimated future revenue growth rates, gross margin on sales, operating margins,\ncapital expenditures, tax rates and discount rates.\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value, a loss on impairment is recognized in an\namount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, the\nCompany considers the income tax effect from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit,\nif applicable, when measuring the goodwill impairment charge.\nIntangible Assets Other Than Goodwill\nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Company and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but\nare tested for impairment at least annually. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names. The\nCompany calculates fair value by comparing a relief-from-royalty method to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived\nintangible asset. This method is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would\notherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. A loss on impairment would\nbe recorded to the extent the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value.\nOther intangible assets that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment\nlosses, if any. Subsequent expenditures for intangible assets are capitalized only when they increase the future economic\nbenefits embodied in the specific asset to which they relate. Amortization is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line\nbasis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The Company has customer relationship assets with lives ranging\nfrom 5 to 9 years. Amortization of intangible assets is included in other depreciation and amortization on the consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income (loss).\n75\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets\nFixed assets including rental equipment and other property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are\nreviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may\nnot be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an\nasset group to future undiscounted cash flows, without interest charges, expected to be generated by the asset group. If\nfuture undiscounted cash flows, without interest charges, exceed the carrying amount of an asset, no impairment is\nrecognized. If management determines that the carrying value cannot be recovered based on estimated future undiscounted\ncash flows, without interest charges, over the shorter of the asset’s estimated useful life or the expected holding period, an\nimpairment loss would be recorded based on the estimated fair value of the asset.\nAssets Held for Sale\nManagement considers an asset to be held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively\nmarket the asset for sale and it is probable that the sale will be completed within twelve months. A sale may be considered\nprobable when a signed sales contract and significant non-refundable deposit or contract break-up fee exist. Upon\ndesignation as held for sale, management records the carrying value of the asset at the lower of its carrying value or its\nestimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and management stops recording depreciation expense. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, no assets were considered held for sale.\nOther Non-Current Assets\nOther non-current assets primarily consist of capitalized software implementation costs for the implementation of cloud\ncomputing systems primarily during 2020 and 2019. The Company capitalizes expenditures related to the implementation\nof cloud computing software as incurred during the application development stage. Such capitalized costs are amortized\nto selling, general, and administrative expenses over the term of the cloud computing hosting arrangement, including\nreasonably certain renewals, beginning when the module or component of the hosting arrangement is ready for its intended\nuse.\nDeferred Financing Costs Revolver, net\nDeferred financing costs revolver are associated with the issuance of the ABL Facility discussed in Note 8. Such costs are\namortized over the contractual term of the line-of-credit through initial maturity using the straight-line method.\nAmortization expense of deferred financing costs revolver is included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statement\nof comprehensive income (loss).\nTerm Loan Deferred Financing Costs\nTerm loan deferred financing costs are associated with the issuances of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior\nSecured Notes discussed in Note 8. The Company presents unamortized deferred financing costs as a direct deduction\nfrom the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Such costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt based on the effective interest rate method.\nOriginal Issuance Discounts\nDebt original discounts are associated with the issuances of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured\nNotes discussed in Note 8 and are recorded as direct deductions to the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes\nand the 2025 Senior Secured Notes on the consolidated balance sheets. Debt discounts are deferred and amortized over\nthe term of the debt based on the effective interest rate method.\nFinance and Operating Leases\nThe Company determines if a contract is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not\nrecorded on the balance sheet. Expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\n76\nterm. For leases with an initial term greater than 12 months, the Company records a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a\ncorresponding lease obligation. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term,\nand lease obligations represent the Company’s obligation to make fixed lease payments as stipulated by the lease. The\nCompany has elected the lessee practical expedient to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to\nnot separate non-lease components from lease components and instead to account for each separate lease component and\nnon-lease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. As a lessee in a lease contract,\nthe Company recognizes a ROU asset and a lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company is a lessee in\na variety of lease contracts, such as land, building, real estate, modular units, equipment and vehicle leases.\nThe Company classifies its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease based on the principle of whether or not\nthe lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset. For operating leases, the Company recognizes lease expense\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For finance leases, the Company recognizes lease expense using the\neffective interest method, which results in the interest component of each lease payment being recognized as interest\nexpense and the lease right-of-use asset being amortized into other depreciation and amortization expense in the\naccompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) using the straight-line method over the term of the\nlease. Operating lease obligations are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease\npayments over the lease term.\nAs the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) based\non information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments over the lease\nterm. The IBR is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term\nan amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The Company determined its IBR for each\nlease by using the IBR in effect as of the start of the quarter of the lease commencement date. In order to estimate the\nCompany’s IBR, the Company first looks to its own unsecured debt offerings, and adjusts the rate for both length of term\nand secured borrowing using available market data as well as consultations with leading national financial institutions that\nare active in the issuance of both secured and unsecured notes.\nOperating ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date, and include the amount of the initial operating\nlease obligation, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, excluding any lease incentives received,\nand any initial direct costs incurred. For leases that have extension options that the Company can exercise at its discretion,\nmanagement uses judgment to determine if it is reasonably certain that the Company will in fact exercise such option. If\nthe extension option is reasonably certain to occur, the Company includes the extended term’s lease payments in the\ncalculation of the respective lease liability. Certain lease contracts may include an option to purchase the leased property,\nwhich is at the Company’s sole discretion. None of the Company’s leases contain any material residual value guarantees\nor material restrictive covenants. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment. If such assets\nare considered to be impaired, the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value and an impairment loss is\nrecognized. The impairment loss recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds\nthe estimated fair value of the assets. Based on the Company’s review, no operating or finance lease ROU assets were\nimpaired during 2022 or 2023.\nThe Company’s leases include a base lease payment, which is recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term. In addition, certain of the Company’s leases may include an additional lease payment for items such as common\narea maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, operating expenses, insurance, personal property expense, or other related\ncharges all of which are recognized as variable lease expense, when incurred, in the consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive income (loss). The variable lease expense incurred by the Company was not based on an index or rate.\nLessor Perspective: For lease agreements in which the Company is the lessor, the Company analyzed the lease and non-\nlease components of its lease agreements and determined that the timing and pattern of transfer for both components are\nthe same. In addition, the leases will continue to qualify as operating leases and the Company will account for and present\nthe lease component under ASC 842 and the non-lease component under ASC 606. Refer to Note 2 for the breakout of\nrevenue under each standard.\nRefer to Notes 13 and 14 for additional lease disclosures.\n77\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company recognizes asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) related to legal obligations associated with the operation\nof the Company’s specialty rental assets. The fair values of these AROs are recorded on a discounted basis, at the time the\nobligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value over the expected timing of settlement.\nChanges in the expected timing or amount of settlement are recognized in the period of change as an increase or decrease\nin the carrying amount of the ARO and related asset retirement costs with decreases in excess of the carrying value of the\nrelated asset retirement cost being recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). The Company\ncapitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these\ncosts over the remaining useful life. The carrying amount of AROs included in the consolidated balance sheets were\n$2.4 million and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which represents the present value of the\nestimated future cost of these AROs of approximately $2.7 million. Accretion expense of approximately $0.2 million,\n$0.2 million, and ($0.2) million was recognized in specialty rental costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nForeign Currency Transactions and Translation\nThe Company’s reporting currency is the US Dollar (USD). Exchange rate adjustments resulting from foreign currency\ntransactions are recognized in profit or loss, whereas effects resulting from the translation of financial statements are\nreflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of equity.\nThe assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is different from the USD are translated into USD at\nexchange rates at the reporting date and revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the respective\nperiod.\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising from a receivable or payable to a consolidated Company entity, the settlement\nof which is neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in the\nCompany entity and are included within accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives revenue from specialty rental and hospitality services, specifically lodging and related ancillary\nservices. Revenue is recognized in the period in which lodging and services are provided pursuant to the terms of\ncontractual relationships with the customers. Certain arrangements contain a lease of lodging facilities to customers. The\nleases are accounted for as operating leases under the authoritative guidance for leases (“ASC 842”) and are recognized\nas income is earned over the term of the lease agreement.\nUpon lease commencement, the Company evaluates leases to determine if they meet criteria set forth in lease accounting\nguidance for classification as sales-type leases or direct financing leases; if a lease meets none of these criteria, the\nCompany classifies the lease as an operating lease. As previously mentioned, the arrangements that contain a lease of the\nCompany’s lodging facilities are accounted for as operating leases, whereby the underlying asset remains on our balance\nsheet and is depreciated consistently with other owned assets, with income recognized as it is earned over the term of the\nlease agreement. For contracts that contain both a lease component and a services or non-lease component, the Company\nhas adopted an accounting policy to account for and present the lease component under ASC 842 and the non-lease\ncomponent under the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition (“ASC 606” or “Topic 606”). Refer to Note 2 for the\nbreakout of revenue under each standard. The Company recognizes minimum rents on operating leases over the term of\nthe customer operating lease. A lease term commences when: (1) the customer has control of the leased space (legal right\nto use the property); and (2) the Company has delivered the premises to the customer as required under the terms of the\nlease. The term of a lease includes the noncancellable periods of the lease along with periods covered by: (1) a customer\noption to extend the lease if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise that option; (2) a customer option to terminate\nthe lease if the customer is reasonably certain not to exercise that option; and (3) an option to extend (or not to terminate)\nthe lease in which exercise of the option is controlled by the Company as the lessor. When assessing the expected lease\nend date, judgment is required in contemplating the significance of: any penalties a customer may incur should it choose\nnot to exercise any existing options to extend the lease or exercise any existing options to terminate the lease; and economic\n78\nincentives for the customer in the lease. Furthermore, when assessing the expected end date of a contract under ASC 606\nwith an extension option, judgment is required to determine whether the option contains a material right.\nBecause performance obligations related to specialty rental and hospitality services are satisfied over time, the majority of\nour revenue is recognized evenly over the contractual term of the arrangement, based on a contractual fixed minimum\namount and defined period of performance. Some of our revenue is recognized on a daily basis, for each night a customer\nstays, at a contractual day rate. Our customers typically contract for accommodation services under committed contracts\nwith terms that most often range from several months to multiple years. Our payment terms vary by type and location of\nour customer and the service offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.\nWhen lodging and services are billed and collected in advance, recognition of revenue is deferred until services are\nrendered.\nCost of services includes labor, food, utilities, supplies, leasing and other direct costs associated with operating the lodging\nunits as well as repair and maintenance expenses. Cost of rental includes leasing costs, utilities, and other direct costs of\nmaintaining the lodging units. Costs associated with contracts include sales commissions which are expensed as incurred\nand reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income\n(loss).\nAdditionally, the Company collects sales, use, occupancy and similar taxes, which the Company presents on a net basis\n(excluded from revenues) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nFair Value Measurements\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement. The inputs are prioritized into three levels that may be used to measure fair\nvalue:\nLevel 1: Inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are observable.\nLevel 2: Inputs that reflect quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical\nor similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs\nare observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3: Inputs that are unobservable to the extent that observable inputs are not available for the asset or liability at\nthe measurement date.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes. The Company accounts\nfor income taxes under the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the\nexpected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred\ntax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of\na change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment\ndate.\nThe Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized.\nIn making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled\nreversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations.\nValuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nWhen a valuation allowance is established or there is an increase in an allowance in a reporting period, tax expense is\ngenerally recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n79\nIn accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a\nbenefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement\napproach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized\nupon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its\ntechnical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a\ntax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Company classifies interest and penalties related to\nuncertain tax positions within income tax expense.\nWarrant Liabilities\nWe evaluated the warrants issued by Platinum Eagle, our legal predecessor, to purchase its common stock in a private\nplacement concurrently with its initial public offering (the “Private Warrants”) under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and\nHedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in\nstockholders’ equity. Specifically, the provisions in the Private Warrant agreement provide for potential changes to the\nsettlement amounts dependent upon the characteristics of the warrant holder and because the holder of a warrant is not an\ninput into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares, such a provision would preclude the warrant from being\nclassified in equity. Since the Private Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, we recorded these\nPrivate Warrants as liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, with subsequent changes in their respective fair values\nrecognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) at each reporting date. The fair value\nadjustments were determined by using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on inputs less observable in the\nmarketplace as described in Note 11. The Private Warrants are deemed equity instruments for income tax purposes, and\naccordingly, there is no tax accounting related to changes in the fair value of the Private Warrants recognized.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company sponsors an equity incentive plan, the Target Hospitality Corp. 2019 Incentive Award Plan, as amended\n(the “Plan”), in which certain employees and non-employee directors participate. The Plan is administered by the\ncompensation committee of the board of directors of the Company (the “Compensation Committee”). The Company\nmeasures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (typically restricted stock unit\nawards (“RSUs”), performance stock unit awards (“PSUs”) and stock options) based on the grant-date fair value of the\nawards issued under the Plan that are equity classified. The fair value of the stock options is calculated using the Black-\nScholes option-pricing model and the fair value of the PSUs that are based on market conditions (“Market-Based PSUs”)\nare calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation while the fair value of the RSUs and performance-based PSUs not based on\nmarket conditions (“Performance-Based PSUs”) are calculated based on the Company’s share price on the grant-date and\nthe assessment of the probability of achieving defined performance measures for Performance-Based PSUs. The resulting\ncompensation expense is recognized over the period during which an employee or non-employee director is required to\nprovide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period. Similarly, for time-based awards subject to graded\nvesting, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. For Market-Based PSUs, the\nprobability of satisfying a market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant-date fair value for Market-Based\nPSUs and the compensation cost is not reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service has\nbeen provided. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The Plan also includes Stock Appreciation Rights awards\n(“SARs”) issued to certain of the Company’s executive officers and other employees. Each SAR represents a contingent\nright to receive, upon vesting, payment in cash or the Company’s Common Stock, as determined by the compensation\ncommittee, in an amount equal to the difference between (a) the fair market value of a Common Share on the date of\nexercise, over (b) the grant date price. Under the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation, these SARs are\nconsidered liability-based awards that are included in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value and are remeasured at fair value each reporting period until the date of settlement using the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model. Changes in the estimated fair value of the SARs along with the resulting cost is\nrecognized as increases or decreases in stock-based compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements\nof comprehensive income (loss) each reporting period over the period during which an employee is required to provide\nservice in exchange for the SARs, usually the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. Refer to Note 18\nfor further details of activity related to the Plan.\n80\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders’ equity at cost. We use the weighted average purchase price to\ndetermine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued, if any.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (ASU 2016 13, Topic 326, or\nASC 326). This new standard changes how companies account for credit impairment for trade and other receivables as\nwell as changing the measurement of credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not\nmeasured at fair value through net income. ASU 2016-13 replaced the prior “incurred loss” model with an “expected loss”\nmodel. Under the “incurred loss” model, a loss (or allowance) is recognized only when an event has occurred (such as a\npayment delinquency) that causes the entity to believe that a loss is probable (i.e., that it has been “incurred”). Under the\n“expected loss” model, a loss (or allowance) is recognized upon initial recognition of the asset that reflects all future events\nthat leads to a loss being realized, regardless of whether it is probable that the future event will occur. The “incurred loss”\nmodel considers past events and current conditions, while the “expected loss” model includes expectations for the future\nwhich have yet to occur. ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses,\nwas issued in November 2018 and excludes operating leases from the new guidance. In 2019, the FASB voted to delay\nthe effective date for the new standard for financial statements issued to reporting periods beginning after December 15,\n2022 and interim periods within those reporting periods. The Company adopted ASC 326, along with its related\nclarifications and amendments, on the effective date of January 1, 2023, using the modified retrospective approach for\ntrade accounts receivable, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment resulting in a decrease to accumulated earnings\nof approximately $0.3 million. Results for reporting periods prior to 2023 continue to be presented in accordance with\npreviously applicable GAAP, while results for subsequent reporting periods are presented under ASC 326.\nThe following table presents the impact of the adoption of ASC 326 on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1,\n2023:\nBalance Balance\nPre-Adoption Adjustments Post-Adoption\nAccounts receivable, less allowance for credit losses $ 42,153 $ (268) $ 41,885\nAccumulated earnings $ 87,683 $ (268) $ 87,415\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, which expands\nreportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.\nThe amendments in the ASU require, among other things, disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly\nprovided to an entity’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and a description of other segment items (the difference\nbetween segment revenue less the segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported\nmeasure of segment profit or loss) by reportable segment, as well as disclosure of the title and position of the CODM, and\nan explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance\nand deciding how to allocate resources. Annual disclosures are required for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2023 and interim disclosures are required for periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Retrospective\napplication is required, and early adoption is permitted. These requirements are not expected to have an impact on our\nfinancial statements, but will result in expanded reportable segment disclosures. The Company does not intend to early\nadopt ASU 2023-07.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which requires disclosure\nof disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate\nreconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and allows for early adoption. These requirements\nare not expected to have an impact on our financial statements, but will impact our income tax disclosures. The Company\ndoes not intend to early adopt ASU 2023-09.\n81\n2. Revenue\nTotal revenue under contracts recognized under ASC 606 was approximately $365.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, while $198 million was specialty rental income subject to the guidance of ASC 842 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Total revenue under contracts recognized under ASC 606 was $333.7 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, while $168.3 million was specialty rental income subject to the guidance of ASC 842 for the year\nended December 31, 2022. Total revenue under contracts recognized under ASC 606 was $214.4 million for the year\nended December 31, 2021, while $76.9 million was specialty rental income subject to the guidance of ASC 842 for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021.\nThe following table disaggregates our services and construction fee income revenues by our two reportable segments as\nwell as the All Other category: HFS–South, Government, and All Other for the years indicated below:\nFor the Ye ar s Ended Dec ember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nHFS–South\nServices income $ 142,666 $ 126,135 $ 108,183\nTotal HFS–South revenues 142,666 126,135 108,183\nGovernment\nServices income $ 211,753 $ 198,249 $ 88,115\nTotal Government revenues 211,753 198,249 88,115\nAll Other\nServices income $ 11,208 $ 9,318 $ 6,835\nConstruction fee income - - 11,294\nTotal All Other revenues 11,208 9,318 18,129\nTotal services and construction fee income revenues $ 365,627 $ 333,702 $ 214,427\nRefer to Note 20—Business Segments, for a discussion of the change in our reportable segments, which was applied to all\ncomparison periods, including for the above table.\nOn July 23, 2021, the Company executed a Termination and Settlement Agreement with TC Energy (the “Termination\nand Settlement Agreement”), which effectively terminated the Company’s contract with TC Energy that was originated in\n2013. The Termination and Settlement Agreement also released the Company from any outstanding work performance\nobligations under the 2013 contract (including all change orders, limited notices to proceed, and amendments).\nAdditionally, the Termination and Settlement Agreement resulted in an agreed upon termination fee of approximately\n$5.0 million that was collected in cash on July 27, 2021. This Termination and Settlement Agreement also resulted in the\nrecognition of approximately $4.9 million of deferred revenue as of the effective date of the Termination and Settlement\nAgreement. All such revenue is recognized in construction fee income within the All Other category included in the above\ntable as well as in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. No further revenue will be generated from the 2013 contract and as of December 31, 2023, there are\nno unrecognized deferred revenue amounts or costs for incomplete projects related to this contract following such\ntermination.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company executed a contract with our NP Partner related to the\nGovernment segment that became effective on May 16, 2022, which represented a significantly expanded lease and\nservices agreement (“Expanded Humanitarian Contract”) to provide enhanced infrastructure and comprehensive facility\nservices that support the critical hospitality solutions the Company provides to the NP Partner and the U.S. Government\nin their humanitarian aid missions. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a significant scope expansion and\nresulted in an advanced payment for the community build-out, and mobilization of asset activities related to the community\nexpansion. The advanced payment was determined to be related to future services to be amortized to revenue over the\nestimated term of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract. The term of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract included an\n82\ninitial term of one-year through May of 2023, with an option to extend the term to November of 2023. The Expanded\nHumanitarian Contract contained both a lease component under ASC 842 and a services or non-lease component under\nASC 606. At the commencement of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract, the Company concluded that the term of the\nExpanded Humanitarian Contract extended to November of 2023, as the option to extend the term to November of 2023\nwas reasonably certain to be exercised under ASC 842 and contained a material right under ASC 606. As such, the\namortization period of the advanced payment was determined to extend to November of 2023. On May 15, 2023, the\nCompany and the NP Partner executed a six-month extension of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract, which extended\nthe period of performance through November 15, 2023, with an option to extend the contract an additional six months\nthrough May of 2024. As such, the Company evaluated the option to extend the contract through May of 2024 and\nconcluded that the option was not reasonably certain to be exercised under ASC 842 and that the extension option did not\ncontain a material right under ASC 606. Therefore, the Company concluded that the amortization period related to the\nadvanced payment associated with the Expanded Humanitarian Contract that became effective on May 16, 2022, would\nnot extend beyond November 15, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized\napproximately $118.2 million of revenue from the amortization of the advanced payment associated with the Expanded\nHumanitarian Contract, which was fully amortized through November 15, 2023, consistent with the termination date of\nthe Expanded Humanitarian Contract. Approximately $62.5 million of the $118.2 million of revenue amortization was\nrecognized as services income under Topic 606, while approximately $55.7 million of the $118.2 million of revenue\namortization was recognized as specialty rental income subject to the guidance of ASC 842. The option to extend the\nExpanded Humanitarian Contract through May of 2024 was not exercised and the Expanded Humanitarian Contract\nterminated on November 15, 2023. The NP Partner then executed the New PCC Contract that became effective on\nNovember 16, 2023, and includes a term with a one-year base period through November 15, 2024, with an option to extend\nfor up to four additional one-year periods and an option to extend for up to six months upon the conclusion of the base\nperiod or any of the option periods. The New PCC Contract did not result in any advanced payments that required an\nassessment of the amortization period. The New PCC Contract operates with similar structure to the Company’s existing\nand prior government services contracts, which are centered around minimum revenue commitments. Additionally, this\nNew PCC Contract includes occupancy-based variable services revenue that may fluctuate with active community\npopulation fluctuations.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains allowances for credit losses. These allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our\nreceivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. Our estimate could require a change based on changing\ncircumstances, including changes in the economy or in the circumstances of individual customers.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nWe do not have any contract assets.\nContract liabilities primarily consist of deferred revenue that represent payments for room nights that the customer may\nuse in the future as well as an advanced payments for community builds, and mobilization of asset activities related to\ncommunity expansions that are being recognized over the related contract period. Activity in the deferred revenue accounts\nas of the dates indicated below was as follows:\nFor the Ye ar s Ended Dec ember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBalances at Beginning of Year $ 125,519 $ 34,411 $ 18,371\nAdditions to deferred revenue - 172,760 127,391\nRevenue recognized (120,050) (81,652) (111,351)\nBalances at End of Year $ 5,469 $ 125,519 $ 34,411\nAs of December 31, 2023, the following table discloses the estimated revenues under ASC 606 related to performance\nobligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) and when we expect to recognize the revenue, and only represents\n83\nrevenue expected to be recognized from contracts where the price and quantity of the product or service are fixed (in\nthousands):\nFor the Years E nd ed December 3 1,\n2024 2025 2026 Total\nRevenue expected to be recognized as of December 31, 2023 $ 117,303 $ 20,207 $ 14,328 $ 151,838\nThe Company applied some of the practical expedients in ASC 606, including the “right to invoice” practical expedient,\nand does not disclose consideration for remaining performance obligations for contracts without minimum revenue\ncommitments or for variable consideration related to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations. Due to\nthe application of these practical expedients as well as excluding rental income revenue subject to the guidance included\nin ASC 842, the table above represents only a portion of the Company’s expected future consolidated revenues and it is\nnot necessarily indicative of the expected trend in total revenues.\n3.

Refer\nto the “Notes Exchange Offer” section within this Note 8 for further discussion regarding the exchange and subsequent\npay off of the remaining 2024 Senior Secured Notes.\nNotes Exchange Offer\nOn September 29, 2023, Arrow Bidco commenced (i) an offer to exchange (the “Notes Exchange Offer”) any and all of\nits outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes for cash and for the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) a solicitation of consents\n(the “Consent Solicitation”) to certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes.\nThe primary purpose of the Notes Exchange Offer was to extend the maturity date of the indebtedness represented by the\n2024 Senior Secured Notes from 2024 to 2025. The Notes Exchange Offer and the Consent Solicitation expired on\nOctober 30, 2023. Approximately $181.4 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes were exchanged by Arrow Bidco on\nNovember 1, 2023 (the “Notes Exchange Offer Settlement Date”) representing a non-cash decrease in cash flows from\nfinancing activities. Additionally, in connection with the 2024 Senior Secured Notes that were exchanged, the Company\npaid accrued interest on the 2024 Senior Secured Notes through the Notes Exchange Offer Settlement Date of\napproximately $2.2 million.\nOn the Notes Exchange Offer Settlement Date, Arrow Bidco issued approximately $181.4 million in 2025 Senior Secured\nNotes pursuant to an indenture, dated November 1, 2023, by and among Arrow Bidco, the guarantors from time to time\nparty thereto and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee and collateral agent (the “2025 Senior Secured\nNotes Indenture”), and paid approximately $2.7 million in cash to eligible holders whose 2024 Senior Secured Notes were\naccepted for exchange in the Notes Exchange Offer, which was capitalized as part of the original issue discount discussed\nbelow. The issuance of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes represented a non-cash increase in cash flows from financing\nactivities. The exchange of a portion of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and corresponding issuance of the 2025 Senior\nSecured Notes was considered a modification of debt for accounting purposes and generated approximately $3.1 million\nin third party transaction costs, which were expensed as incurred within selling, general and administrative expenses in\nthe accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2023. Following\nthese transactions, approximately $28.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes remained\noutstanding, which were subsequently redeemed on November 21, 2023 resulting in an outstanding balance of $0 as of\nDecember 31, 2023. This redemption was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt. In connection with the redemption\nof the remaining 2024 Senior Secured Notes that were not exchanged, the Company paid off approximately $0.5 million\nof related accrued interest.\nSenior Secured Notes 2025\nThe 2025 Senior Secured Notes will mature on June 15, 2025; provided that if any 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain\noutstanding on March 15, 2024, then the 2025 Senior Secured Notes will mature on March 15, 2024 at a make-whole\nprice. As discussed above, no 2024 Senior Secured Notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Interest on the\n2025 Senior Secured Notes will accrue at 10.75% per annum, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of\n88\neach year, beginning March 15, 2024. Refer to the table below for a description of the amounts related to the 2025 Senior\nSecured Notes, which are recognized within long-term debt, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nDecember 31,\n2023\nPrincipal amount of 10.75% Senior Secured Notes, due 2025 $ 181,446\nLess: unamortized original issue discount (2,619)\nLess: unamortized term loan deferred financing costs (734)\nLong-term debt, net $ 178,093\nIf Arrow Bidco undergoes a change of control or sells certain of its assets, Arrow Bidco may be required to offer to\nrepurchase the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Prior to September 15, 2024, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes will be redeemable\nat Arrow Bidco’s option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a customary make whole\npremium for the 2025 Senior Secured Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but not\nincluding the redemption date. The customary make whole premium, with respect to the 2025 Senior Secured Notes on\nany applicable redemption date, as calculated by Arrow Bidco, is the greater of (1) 1.00% of the then outstanding principal\namount of the Note; and (2) the excess of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price at\nSeptember 15, 2024 plus (ii) all required interest payments due on the 2025 Senior Secured Note through September 15,\n2024, excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date, in each case, computed using a discount rate equal to\nthe Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over (b) the then outstanding principal amount of the\n2025 Senior Secured Notes. On and after September 15, 2024, Arrow Bidco, at its option, may redeem any outstanding\n2025 Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than fifteen (15) nor more than sixty (60) days’ prior written\nnotice to holders and not less than twenty (20) days’ prior written notice to the Trustee (or such shorter timeline as the\nTrustee may agree), at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured\nNotes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the applicable\nredemption date (subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment\ndate falling on or prior to the redemption date), if redeemed during the 6-month period beginning on the dates set forth\nbelow at the redemption prices listed below:\nRedemption\nDate Price\nSeptember 15, 2024 102.000%\nMarch 15, 2025 and thereafter 101.000%\nThe 2025 Senior Secured Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by Topaz and each of Arrow Bidco’s direct and indirect\nwholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the “2025 Note Guarantors”). Target Hospitality is not an issuer or a\nguarantor of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. The 2025 Note Guarantors are either borrowers or guarantors under the ABL\nFacility. To the extent lenders under the ABL Facility release the guarantee of any 2025 Note Guarantor, such 2025 Note\nGuarantor is also released from obligations under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. These guarantees are secured by a second\npriority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Arrow Bidco and the 2025 Note Guarantors (subject to\ncustomary exclusions). The guarantees of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes by TLM Equipment, LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company (“TLM Equipment LLC”) which holds certain of Target Hospitality’s assets, are subordinated to its\nobligations under the ABL Facility (as defined below).\nThe 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains covenants that limit Arrow Bidco’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to,\namong other things, (i) incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain types of stock, (ii) create or incur certain liens,\n(iii) make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, (iv) prepay or redeem junior debt, (v) make certain\ninvestments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures, (vi) engage in certain transactions with affiliates and\n(vii) sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies. These covenants are subject to a number of important\nlimitations and exceptions. In addition, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Arrow Bidco must offer\nto repurchase the 2025 Senior Secured Notes at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,\nbut excluding, the applicable repurchase date. The 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture also provides for events of default,\n89\nwhich, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary\nobligations on all of the then outstanding 2025 Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately.\nArrow Bidco’s ultimate parent, Target Hospitality, has no significant independent assets or operations except as included\nin the guarantors of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the guarantees under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes are full and\nunconditional and joint and several, and any subsidiaries of Target Hospitality that are not subsidiary guarantors of the\n2025 Senior Secured Notes are minor. There are also no significant restrictions on the ability of Target Hospitality or any\nguarantor to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan. See discussion of certain negative covenants above.\nTherefore, pursuant to the SEC Rules, no individual guarantor financial statement disclosures are deemed necessary.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, there was an original issue discount of $2.7 million and\nthe unamortized balance of $2.6 million is presented on the face of the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,\n2023 as a reduction of the principal. The discount is amortized over the life of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes using the\neffective interest method.\nFinance Lease and Other Financing Obligations\nThe Company’s finance lease and other financing obligations as of December 31, 2023 consisted of $2.4 million of finance\nleases. The finance leases pertain to leases entered into during 2017 through 2023, for commercial-use vehicles with\n36-month terms (and continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter) expiring through 2026. Refer to Note 13 for further\ndiscussion of finance leases, including the weighted average discount rate applicable to these finance leases.\nThe Company’s finance lease and other financing obligations as of December 31, 2022, primarily consisted of $2.2 million\nof finance leases related to commercial-use vehicles with the same terms as described above.\nABL Facility\nOn March 15, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), Topaz, Arrow Bidco, Target, Signor and each of their domestic subsidiaries\nentered into an ABL credit agreement that provided for a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility in the\naggregate principal amount of up to $125 million (the “ABL Facility”), which was increased to $175 million with the\nThird Amendment discussed below. The historical debt of Arrow Bidco, Target and their respective subsidiaries under\nthe Algeco ABL Facility was settled on March 15, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $70 million was\ndrawn and $70 million was repaid on the ABL Facility resulting in an outstanding balance of $0 as of December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, no amounts were drawn or repaid on the ABL Facility resulting in an\noutstanding balance of $0 as of December 31, 2023.\nIn accordance with the First Amendment to the ABL Facility on February 1, 2023 (the “First Amendment”), the reference\ninterest rate for LIBOR borrowings changed from LIBOR to Term SOFR (commencing as of the effective date of the First\nAmendment).\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility, at the relevant borrower’s (the borrowers under the ABL Facility, the “Borrowers”)\noption, bear interest at either (1) Term SOFR or (2) a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable\nmargin is 4.25% to 4.75% with respect to Term SOFR borrowings and 3.25% to 3.75% with respect to base rate borrowings\nbased on achieving certain excess availability levels. The rates of the applicable margin were determined in connection\nwith the Third Amendment to the ABL Facility on October 12, 2023 (the “Third Amendment”).\nPursuant to the Third Amendment, the ABL Facility provides borrowing availability of an amount equal to the lesser of\n(a) $175 million and (b) the Borrowing Base (defined below) (the “Line Cap”).\nThe Borrowing Base is, at any time of determination, an amount (net of reserves) equal to the sum of:\n• 85% of the net book value of the Borrowers’ eligible accounts receivables, plus\n90\n• the lesser of (i) 95% of the net book value of the Borrowers’ eligible rental equipment and (ii) 85% of the net\norderly liquidation value of the Borrowers’ eligible rental equipment, minus\n• customary reserves\nThe ABL Facility includes borrowing capacity available for standby letters of credit of up to $25 million and for\n“swingline” loan borrowings of up to $15 million. Any issuance of letters of credit or making of a swingline loan will\nreduce the amount available under the ABL Facility.\nIn addition, the ABL Facility will provide the Borrowers with the option to increase commitments under the ABL Facility\nin an aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million plus any voluntary prepayments that are accompanied by permanent\ncommitment reductions under the ABL Facility. As a result of the First Amendment, the termination date of the ABL\nFacility was extended from September 15, 2023 to February 1, 2028, which extended termination date was subject to a\nspringing maturity that would have accelerated the maturity of the ABL Facility. On August 10, 2023, Arrow Bidco and\ncertain of the Company’s other subsidiaries entered into a second amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the ABL\nFacility. The Second Amendment amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, modify the springing maturity that\nwould have accelerated the maturity of the ABL Facility if any of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remained outstanding\nfrom the date that was six months prior to the stated maturity date thereof to the date that was ninety-one days prior to the\nstated maturity date thereof. Finally, the Third Amendment amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, set the\ntermination date of the ABL Facility to February 1, 2028, subject to springing maturity triggers that will accelerate the\nmaturity of the ABL Facility if: (i) any of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding on the date that is ninety-\none days prior to the stated maturity date thereof or (ii) any of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding on the\ndate that is ninety-one days prior to the stated maturity date thereof.\nThe obligations under the ABL Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Topaz and each existing and subsequently\nacquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned U.S. organized restricted subsidiary of Arrow Bidco (together with\nTopaz, the “ABL Guarantors”), other than certain excluded subsidiaries. The ABL Facility is secured by (i) a first priority\npledge of the equity interests of Topaz, Arrow Bidco, Target, and Signor (the “Borrowers) and of each direct, wholly-\nowned US organized restricted subsidiary of any Borrower or any ABL Guarantor, (ii) a first priority pledge of up to 65%\nof the voting equity interests in each non-US restricted subsidiary of any Borrower or ABL Guarantor and (iii) a first\npriority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and the ABL Guarantors (in each case, subject to\ncustomary exceptions).\nAs stated in the Third Amendment, the ABL Facility requires the Borrowers to maintain a (i) minimum fixed charge\ncoverage ratio of not less than 1.00:1.00 and (ii) maximum total leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00.\nThe ABL Facility also contains a number of customary negative covenants. Such covenants, among other things, limit or\nrestrict the ability of each of the Borrowers, their restricted subsidiaries, and where applicable, Topaz, to:\n• incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock and make guarantees;\n• incur liens on assets;\n• engage in mergers or consolidations or fundamental changes;\n• sell assets;\n• pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock;\n• make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions;\n• amend organizational documents and master lease documents;\n• enter into certain agreements that would restrict the ability to pay dividends;\n• repay certain junior indebtedness; and\n• change the conduct of its business.\n91\nThe aforementioned restrictions are subject to certain exceptions including (i) the ability to incur additional indebtedness,\nliens, investments, dividends and distributions, and prepayments of junior indebtedness subject, in each case, to\ncompliance with certain financial metrics and certain other conditions and (ii) a number of other traditional exceptions that\ngrant the ABL Borrowers continued flexibility to operate and develop their businesses. The ABL Facility also contains\ncertain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.\nThe carrying value of debt outstanding as of the dates indicated below consist of the following:\nD ecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nFinance lease and other financing obligations (Note 13) $ 2,393 $ 2,223\n10.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025, face amount 181,446 —\nLess: unamortized original issue discount (2,619) —\nLess: unamortized term loan deferred financing costs (734) —\n9.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2024, face amount — 334,500\nLess: unamortized original issue discount — (971)\nLess: unamortized term loan deferred financing costs — (4,681)\nTotal debt, net 180,486 331,071\nLess: current maturities (1,369) (1,135)\nTotal long-term debt $ 179,117 $ 329,936\nInterest expense, net\nThe components of interest expense, net (which includes interest expense incurred) recognized in the consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income (loss) for the periods indicated below consist of the following, including the\ncomponents of interest expense, net on the 2024 and 2025 Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Notes”):\nFor the Ye ar s Ended Dec ember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nInterest incurred on finance lease and other financing obligations $ 212 $ 72 $ 58\nInterest expense incurred on ABL Facility and Notes 22,935 33,464 33,670\nAmortization of deferred financing costs on ABL Facility and Notes 2,881 4,605 4,338\nAmortization of original issue discount on Notes 750 711 638\nInterest capitalized — (983) —\nInterest income (4,139) (1,546) —\nInterest expense, net $ 22,639 $ 36,323 $ 38,704\nDeferred Financing Costs and Original Issue Discount\nIn connection with the Notes Exchange Offer and issuance of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes in 2023, the Company incurred\nand deferred approximately $0.8 million of deferred financing costs and approximately $2.7 million of original issue\ndiscount, which are included in the carrying value of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes as of December 31, 2023. The Company\nincurred and deferred approximately $16.3 million of deferred financing costs and approximately $3.3 million of original\nissue discount in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes in 2019, which are included in the carrying\nvalue of the Notes as of December 31, 2022. The Company presents unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized\noriginal issue discount as a direct deduction from the principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and the 2024\nSenior Secured Notes on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Accumulated\namortization expense related to the deferred financing costs was approximately $13.5 million and $11.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Accumulated amortization of the original issue discount was approximately\n$3.1 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As previously mentioned, the partial\nredemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on March 15, 2023 was accounted for as a partial extinguishment of debt and\nconsequently, a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount\n92\nwere expensed through loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as of the\nprepayment date. The Company recognized a charge of approximately $1.7 million in loss on extinguishment of debt\nrelated to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount during the first\nquarter of 2023. As previously mentioned, the exchange of a portion of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the issuance\nof the 2025 Senior Secured Notes on November 1, 2023 was accounted for as a modification of debt and consequently,\nthe unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount at the time of the modification of\napproximately $1.0 million associated with the portion of 2024 Senior Secured Notes that were exchanged for the 2025\nSenior Secured Notes will be deferred and amortized over the term of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Alternatively, the\nremaining unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount associated with the portion of the\n2024 Senior Secured Notes that were redeemed on November 21, 2023 (not exchanged) were expensed through loss on\nextinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as of the redemption date. The Company\nrecognized a charge of approximately $0.2 million in loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized\ndeferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount during 2023 related to the Notes Exchange Offer and the\nredemption of the remaining balance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on November 21, 2023.\nThe Company also incurred deferred financing costs associated with the ABL Facility in the amount of approximately\n$6.1 million and $3.9 million, which are capitalized and presented on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, within deferred financing costs revolver, net. These costs are amortized over the contractual\nterm of the line-of-credit through the initial maturity date using the straight-line method.\nIn connection with the First Amendment, which was considered a modification for accounting purposes, any unamortized\ndeferred financing costs from the ABL Facility that pertained to non-continuing lenders were expensed through loss on\nextinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as of the amendment date. As such, the\nCompany recognized a charge of approximately $0.4 million in loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of\nunamortized deferred financing costs pertaining to non-continuing lenders during the first quarter of 2023. As the\nborrowing capacity of each of the continuing lenders on the amended ABL Facility was greater than the borrowing capacity\nof the ABL Facility before the amendment, the unamortized deferred financing costs at the time of the modification of\napproximately $0.4 million associated with the continuing lenders was deferred and amortized over the remaining term of\nthe ABL Facility. Additionally, the Company incurred and paid approximately $1.4 million and $1.0 million of deferred\nfinancing costs as a result of the First Amendment and Third Amendment, respectively, which are capitalized and presented\non the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 within deferred financing costs revolver, net. These costs are\namortized over the contractual term of the line-of-credit through the maturity date using the straight-line method.\nAccumulated amortization related to revolver deferred financing costs for the ABL Facility was approximately\n$5.3 million and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRefer to the components of interest expense table in Note 8 for the amounts of the amortization expense related to the\ndeferred financing costs and original issue discount recognized for each of these debt instruments for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFuture maturities\nThe aggregate annual principal maturities of debt and finance lease obligations for each of the next five years, based on\ncontractual terms are listed in the table below. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on our finance lease obligations,\nincluding contractual terms.\nThe schedule of future maturities as of December 31, 2023 consists of the following:\n2024 $ 1,369\n2025 182,285\n2026 185\nTotal $ 183,839\n93\n9. Warrant Liabilities\nOn January 17, 2018, Harry E. Sloan, Joshua Kazam, Fredric D. Rosen, the Sara L. Rosen Trust and the Samuel N. Rosen\n2015 Trust, purchased from Platinum Eagle an aggregate of 5,333,334 Private Warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant\n(for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million) in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the completion\nof its initial public offering. Each Private Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at $11.50 per\nshare. The purchase price of the Private Warrants was added to the proceeds from Platinum Eagle’s initial public offering\nand was held in the Trust Account until the formation of the Company on March 15, 2019. The Private Warrants (including\nthe shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Warrants) were not transferable, assignable or salable\nuntil 30 days after the formation of the Company on March 15, 2019, and they may be exercised on a cashless basis and\nare non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers of the Private Warrants or their permitted transferees.\nThe Company evaluated Private Warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own\nEquity, and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity and should be classified as\nliabilities. Since the Private Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, the Company recorded the Private\nWarrants as liabilities on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value.\nSubsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the Private Warrants are reflected in the change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The change in the estimated fair\nvalue of the Private Warrants resulted in a loss (gain) of approximately ($9.1) million, $31.7 million, and $1.1 million\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2022, holders exchanged 3,800,000 Private Warrants for shares of Common Stock resulting in the\nestimated fair value of these exchanged Private Warrants being reclassified to additional paid-in-capital within the\nstockholders’ equity section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as more fully discussed in the “Warrant\nExchange” section included in Note 17. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had 1,533,334 Private Warrants\nissued and outstanding, respectively, which expire on March 15, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Private Warrants\nwere classified as current warrant liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Company determined the following estimated fair values for the outstanding Private Warrants as of the dates indicated\nbelow:\nD ecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nWarrant liabilities $ 675 $ 9,737\nTotal $ 675 $ 9,737\n10.

The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was 22.7%, 30.4% and\n(71.3)%, respectively. The fluctuation in the rate for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively,\nresults primarily from the relationship of year-to-date income (loss) before income tax, the fluctuation in the permanent\nadd-back related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities on the Company’s warrants, the impact of state tax\nexpense based off of gross receipts, and a compensation deduction limitation during each of the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating loss and carryforwards.\nSignificant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the Company are as follows:\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities)\nStock-based compensation $ 3,191 $ 4,793\nDeferred revenue 1,216 1,621\nIntangible assets 8,859 9,157\nTax loss carryforwards 2,588 30,649\nOperating lease obligations 4,437 5,152\nInterest carryforwards - 4,997\nOther—net 727 23\nDeferred tax assets gross 21,018 56,392\nValuation allowance (5,023) (4,486)\nNet deferred income tax asset 15,995 51,906\nDeferred tax liabilities\nRental equipment and other plant, property and equipment (63,536) (60,771)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets (4,297) (5,955)\nSoftware (95) (352)\nPrepaid expenses (1,141) -\nDeferred tax liability (69,069) (67,078)\nNet deferred income tax liability $ (53,074) $ (15,172)\nTax loss carryovers for foreign income tax purposes totaled approximately $9 million at December 31, 2023 as shown in\nthe below table. Approximately $9 million of these foreign income tax loss carryovers expire between 2024 and 2044.\nRealization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards. A valuation\n95\nallowance has been established against the deferred tax assets to the extent it is not more likely than not they will be\nrealized.\nValuation\n2023 Expiration Allowance\nCanada $ 8,432 2032-2044 100 %\nMexico 546 2024-2033 100 %\nTotal $ 8,978\nUnrecognized Tax Positions\nNo amounts have been accrued for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. However, management’s\nconclusion regarding uncertain tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on ongoing\nanalyses of tax laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof and other factors. The Company does not have any\nunrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized\ntax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. Additionally, no interest or penalty related to uncertain\ntaxes has been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in US, Canada, Mexico and state jurisdictions. The Company’s tax returns are subject\nto examination by the applicable tax authorities prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing additional\ntaxes, which generally ranges from two to five years. Therefore, as of December 31, 2023, tax years for 2017 through 2023\ngenerally remain subject to examination by the tax authorities. In addition, in the case of certain tax jurisdictions in which\nthe Company has loss carryforwards, the tax authority in some of these jurisdictions may examine the amount of the tax\nloss carryforward based on when the loss is utilized rather than when it arises.\n11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged\nin a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.\nThe Company has assessed that the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, other current\nliabilities, and other debt approximates their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities or recent\ncommencement of these instruments. The fair value of the ABL Facility is primarily based upon observable market data,\nsuch as market interest rates, for similar debt. The fair value of the Notes is based upon observable market data.\nLevel 1 & 2 Disclosures:\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, which are either Level 1 or Level 2, are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 Decemb er 31, 2022\nCarrying Carrying\nFinancial Assets (Liabilities) Not Measured at Fair Value Amount Fair Value Amount Fair Value\nABL Facility (See Note 8)—Level 2 $ — $ — $ — $ —\nSenior Secured Notes (See Note 8)—Level 1 $ (178,093) $ (187,797) $ (328,848) $ (335,403)\nRecurring fair value measurements\nLevel 3 Disclosures:\nThere were 1,533,334 Private Warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Based on the fair\nvalue assessment that was performed, the Company determined a fair value price per Private Warrant of $0.44 and $6.35\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The fair value is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to\nthe use of pricing inputs that are less observable in the marketplace combined with management judgment required for the\n96\nassumptions underlying the calculation of value. The Company determined the estimated fair value of the Private Warrants\nusing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The table below summarizes the inputs used to calculate the fair value of\nthe warrant liabilities at each of the dates indicated below:\nD ecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nExercise Price $ 11.50 $ 11.50\nStock Price $ 9.73 $ 15.14\nDividend Yield 0.00% 0.00%\nExpected Term (in Years) 0.20 1.20\nRisk-Free Interest Rate 5.31% 4.56%\nExpected Volatility 56.00% 70.00%\nPer Share Value of Warrants $ 0.44 $ 6.35\nThe following table presents changes in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nPri vate Placement Warrants\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ 1,600\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 31,735\nAdditional paid-in-capital reclass for warrant exchange (Note 17) (23,598)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 9,737\nThe following table presents changes in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nPri vate Placement Warrants\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 9,737\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (9,062)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 675\nThere were no transfers of financial instruments between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits or claims in the ordinary course of business. Management is of the opinion\nthat there is no pending claim or lawsuit which, if adversely determined, would have a material impact on the financial\ncondition of the Company.\nRefer to Note 13 for disclosure regarding future minimum lease payments over the next five years at December 31, 2023,\nby year and in the aggregate, under non-cancelable operating leases.\n97\n13. Leases\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company has both finance and operating leases. The finance leases are solely comprised of the Company’s\ncommercial-use vehicles, maturing in dates ranging from 2024 to 2026, including expected renewal options. Including all\nrenewal options available to the Company, the lease maturity date may extend on a month-to-month basis for an unlimited\nperiod of time. Operating leases consist of land, building, office, certain community units, and equipment leases, maturing\nin dates ranging from 2024 to 2027, including expected renewal options. Including all renewal options available to the\nCompany, the lease maturity date extends to 2118.\nLeases were included on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as follows:\nD ecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nFinance Lease:\nRight-of-use assets, net(1) $ 2,422 $ 2,313\nCurrent portion of finance lease obligations(2) $ 1,369 $ 1,135\nLong-term finance lease obligations(3) 1,024 1,088\nTotal lease obligation $ 2,393 $ 2,223\nWeighted average remaining lease term 2.0 Years 2.2 Years\nWeighted average discount rate 10.31% 6.30%\nOperating Leases:\nRight-of-use assets, net(4) $ 19,698 $ 27,298\nCurrent portion of operating lease obligations $ 11,914 $ 12,516\nLong-term operating lease obligations 8,426 11,104\nTotal lease obligations(4) $ 20,340 $ 23,620\nWeighted average remaining lease term 2.2 Years 2.8 Years\nWeighted average discount rate 8.53% 5.37%\n(1) Finance lease right-of-use assets, net are included in other property, plant and equipment, net on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n(2) Current portion of finance lease obligations are included in current portion of finance lease and other financing\nobligations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, this financial statement line item is\nsolely comprised of the long-term finance lease obligations given the long-term other financing obligations is $0.\n(4) The difference between the operating lease right-of-use assets, net and operating lease obligations, current and long-\nterm, as of December 31, 2022 primarily relates to approximately $3.7 million of unamortized prepaid delivery and\ninstallation costs that were paid at or before lease commencement and capitalized to the right-of-use assets in\naccordance with ASC 842.\n98\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\n2023 2022\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use asset $ 1,454 $ 2,647\nInterest on lease obligations 212 72\nTotal finance lease cost $ 1,666 $ 2,719\nOperating lease cost $ 18,921 $ 11,927\nShort-term lease cost $ 222 $ 8,308\nVariable lease cost(1) $ 2,493 $ 1,789\n(1) Consists primarily of common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, operating expenses and insurance for real\nestate leases; insurance and personal property expense for equipment leases; and certain vehicle related charges for\nfinance leases. For 2023, the amount of variable lease costs disclosed above also includes approximately $0.1 million\nof lease costs related to base rent associated with long-term immaterial leases with a present value of total minimum\nlease payments less than $25,000 with an average remaining lease term of approximately 1.4 years as of December 31,\n2023. For 2022, the amount of variable lease costs disclosed above also includes approximately $0.3 million of lease\ncosts related to base rent associated with long-term immaterial leases with a present value of total minimum lease\npayments less than $25,000 and long-term leases that terminated within 3 months of the implementation date\n(January 1, 2022) with an average lease term of approximately 1.6 years as of the implementation date.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from finance leases $ 212 $ 72\nOperating cash flows from operating leases(1) $ 14,602 $ 15,605\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases $ 1,404 $ 1,008\n(1) For 2022, includes approximately $5.9 million of prepaid delivery and installation costs that were paid at or before\nlease commencement and capitalized to the right-of-use assets in accordance with ASC 842. For 2023, includes\napproximately $1.1 million of interest, while 2022 includes approximately $1.0 million of interest.\nFuture maturities of the Company’s finance and operating lease obligations at December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nFi nance Lease Operating Leases\n2024 $ 1,432 $ 12,518\n2025 975 5,429\n2026 253 3,283\n2027 — 608\nTotal lease payments 2,660 21,838\nLess: interest(1) (267) (1,498)\nPresent value of lease obligations $ 2,393 $ 20,340\n(1) Calculated using the appropriate discount rate for each lease.\nRent expense included in services costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for cancelable and\nnon-cancelable operating leases was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Rent expense included in the\nselling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for cancelable\nand non-cancelable operating leases was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n99\n14. Rental Income\nLessor Accounting\nCertain arrangements contain a lease of lodging facilities (“Lodges”) to customers. Rental income from these leases for\n2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $198.0 million, $168.3 million and $76.9 million, respectively. Each Lodge is\nleased exclusively to one customer and is accounted for as an operating lease under the authoritative guidance for leases.\nRevenue related to these lease arrangements is reflected as specialty rental income in the consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nScheduled future minimum lease payments to be received by the Company as of December 31, 2023 for each of the next\nfive years is as follows:\n2024 $ 115,448\n2025 34,300\n2026 25,657\nTotal $ 175,405\nThe leased assets consists primarily of specialty rental assets with a gross cost of approximately $209.2 million and\n$199.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with accumulated depreciation of approximately\n$113.9 million and $90.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The leased assets have a balance net of\naccumulated depreciation of approximately $95.3 million and $109.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and are included within specialty rental assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Such\nassets are depreciated consistent with the depreciation methods discussed in Note 1 for specialty rental assets. The\ncorresponding depreciation expense was $23.1 million in 2023, $14.0 million in 2022, and $15.7 million in 2021 and is\nrecognized within depreciation of specialty rental assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome (loss).\n15. Related Parties\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Company incurred $0, $0, and $0.6 million\nin commissions owed to related parties, included in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The underlying commission agreement driving these charges\nexpired in 2021 and was not renewed; therefore, no amounts were accrued for these commissions on the consolidated\nbalance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPrior to the closing of the formation of the Company, Mr. Diarmuid Cummins (the “Advisor”) provided certain consulting\nand advisory services (the “Services”) to Target’s former parent and certain of its affiliated entities (collectively,\n“Algeco”), including Target. The Advisor was compensated for these Services by Algeco. Following the formation of the\nCompany, the Advisor continued to provide these Services to Algeco and to the Company and is serving as an observer\non the board of directors of the Company. The Advisor is currently compensated for these services by Chard Camp\nCatering Services Ltd. (“Chard”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In June 2019, Chard and Algeco Global\nSarl (“Algeco Global”) entered into a reimbursement agreement, as amended in July 2019, (the “Agreement”), pursuant\nto which Algeco Global agreed to reimburse Chard for 100% of the total compensation paid by it to the Advisor, from and\nafter January 1, 2019, with such amounts to be paid monthly. The Company and Algeco Global are each majority owned\nby TDR Capital. The initial term of the Agreement ran through December 31, 2019 and automatically extended for an\nadditional 12 month term. The reimbursement income generated from this agreement for the year ended December 31,\n2020 amounted to approximately $1.1 million and was included in the other expense (income), net line within the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). The agreement terminated on December 31, 2020 and was not\nrenewed; therefore, no amounts were reimbursed and no reimbursement income was recognized within the consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and no\namounts are recorded as a related party receivable on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The related party receivable amount of approximately $1.2 million that was reported on the consolidated\nbalance sheet as of December 31, 2020 was paid in full in March of 2021 and is reflected as an operating cash inflow and\n100\nincluded as a component of net cash provided by operating activities within the accompanying consolidated statement of\ncash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021. No further income or cash flows are expected from this reimbursement\narrangement.\n16. Earnings (Loss) per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS” or “LPS”) is calculated by dividing net income or loss attributable to Target\nHospitality by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS or\nLPS is computed similarly to basic net earnings or loss per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could\noccur if dilutive securities were exercised. We apply the treasury stock method in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss)\nper share. The following table reconciles net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and the weighted average\nshares outstanding for the basic calculation to the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and the weighted\naverage shares outstanding for the diluted calculation for the periods indicated below ($ in thousands, except per share\namounts):\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator\nNet income (loss) attributable to Common Stockholders—basic $ 173,700 $ 73,939 $ (4,576)\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (9,062) - -\nNet income (loss) attributable to Common Stockholders—diluted $ 164,638 $ 73,939 $ (4,576)\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares outstanding—basic 101,350,910 97,213,166 96,611,022\nDilutive effect of outstanding securities:\nWarrants 1,469,598 - -\nPSUs 500,690 466,563 -\nSARs 218,655 - -\nStock options 494,536 518,409 -\nRSUs 1,285,016 1,859,610 -\nWeighted average shares outstanding—diluted 105,319,405 100,057,748 96,611,022\nNet income (loss) per share—basic $ 1.71 $ 0.76 $ (0.05)\nNet income (loss) per share—diluted $ 1.56 $ 0.74 $ (0.05)\n5,015,898 shares of the 8,050,000 shares of common stock held by the Founders, were placed into escrow subject to release\npursuant to the terms of the earnout agreement entered into in connection with the formation of the Company by and\nbetween Harry E. Sloan, Jeff Sagansky, Eli Baker and the Company (the “Earnout Agreement”). Upon being placed into\nescrow, the voting and economic rights of the shares were suspended for the period they were in escrow. Given that the\nFounders were not entitled to vote or participate in the economic rewards available to the other shareholders with respect\nto these shares, these shares were not included in the basic and diluted LPS calculations for the year ended December 31,\n2021. In accordance with the Earnout Agreement, as of the expiration date of the earnout period (March 15, 2022), the\n5,015,898 Founder Shares in escrow had not been released and were cancelled and returned to the Company to be held in\ntreasury. As such, these cancelled shares were reclassed from Common Stock to common stock in treasury and continued\nto be excluded from the computations of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWhen liability-classified warrants are in the money and the impact of their inclusion on diluted EPS is dilutive, diluted\nEPS also assumes share settlement of such instruments through an adjustment to net income available to common\nstockholders for the fair value (gain) loss on common stock warrant liabilities and inclusion of the number of dilutive\nshares in the denominator. The Public and Private Warrants representing 8,061,656 and 16,166,650 of the Company’s\ncommon stock for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were excluded from the computation of\ndiluted EPS and LPS because they are considered anti-dilutive. Public and Private Warrants representing a total of\n101\n8,044,287 shares of the Company’s Common Stock for the year ended December 31, 2023 were included in the\ncomputation of diluted EPS because their effect is dilutive as noted in the above table.\nAs discussed in Note 18, stock-based compensation awards were outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. These stock-based compensation awards were excluded from the computation of diluted LPS\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31,\n2022, certain stock-based compensation awards were included in the computation of diluted EPS because their effect is\ndilutive as noted in the above table. For the year ended December 31, 2023, stock-based compensation awards were\nincluded in the computation of diluted EPS because their effect is dilutive as noted in the above table. However,\napproximately 716,025 of contingently issuable PSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the year\nended December 31, 2023 as not all necessary conditions for issuance of these PSUs were satisfied, which includes 91,025\nof PSUs that did not meet all of the Company’s Diversification EBITDA and TSR criteria (see Note 18) and 625,000 of\nPSUs issued in 2022 that did not meet all of the specified share price thresholds as discussed in Note 18.\nShares of treasury stock have been excluded from the computation of LPS and EPS.\n17. Stockholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock\nAs of December 31, 2023, Target Hospitality had 111,091,266 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share\nissued and 101,660,601 outstanding. Each share of Common Stock has one vote, except the voting rights related to the\n5,015,898 of Founder Shares that were placed in escrow were suspended subject to release pursuant to the terms of the\nEarnout Agreement. As of the expiration date of the earnout period (March 15, 2022), the 5,015,898 Founder Shares in\nescrow had not been released and were cancelled and returned to the Company to be held in treasury pursuant to the terms\nof the Earnout Agreement. As such, these cancelled Founder Shares were reclassed from Common Stock to common stock\nin treasury during the year ended December 31, 2022 as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes\nin stockholders’ equity.\nPreferred Shares\nTarget Hospitality is authorized to issue 1,000,000 preferred shares with par value of $0.0001 per share. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, no preferred shares were issued or outstanding.\nPublic Warrants\nOn January 17, 2018, PEAC sold 32,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “Units”) in its initial public offering\n(the “Public Offering”), including the issuance of 2,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ partial exercise of their\noverallotment option. Each Unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share of PEAC, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Public\nShares”), and one-third of one warrant to purchase one ordinary share (the “Public Warrants”).\nEach Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Company’s Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per\nshare. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. If upon exercise of the Public Warrants, a\nholder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company will upon exercise, round down to the\nnearest whole number, the number of shares to be issued to the Public Warrant holder. Each Public Warrant became\nexercisable 30 days after the formation of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had 10,833,316 Public Warrants issued and outstanding with the same terms as\ndescribed above. During the year ended December 31, 2022, holders of Public Warrants exercised 7,101 Public Warrants\nfor shares of Common Stock resulting in the Company receiving cash proceeds of approximately $0.1 million and issuing\n7,101 shares of Common Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, holders exchanged 4,297,893 Public Warrants\nfor shares of common stock as part of the Warrant Exchange discussed below. As of December 31, 2022, the Company\nhad 6,528,322 Public Warrants issued and outstanding.\n102\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, holders of Public Warrants exercised 17,369 Public Warrants for shares of\nCommon Stock resulting in the Company receiving cash proceeds of approximately $0.2 million and issuing 17,369 shares\nof Common Stock. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 6,510,953 Public Warrants issued and outstanding, which\nexpire on March 15, 2024.\nWarrant Exchange\nOn November 18, 2022, the Company commenced an offer to exchange the Public and Private Warrants for shares of its\ncommon stock in a cashless transaction (the “Warrant Exchange”). In the offer, each warrant holder had the opportunity\nto receive 0.37 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company in exchange for each warrant\ntendered by the holder and exchanged pursuant to the offer.\nThe Warrant Exchange offer expired on December 16, 2022 and a total of 8,097,893 of the outstanding Public and Private\nWarrants were tendered and accepted for exchange, which consisted of 4,297,893 Public Warrants and 3,800,000 Private\nWarrants. Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Exchange, the Company issued 2,996,201 shares of Common Stock on\nDecember 22, 2022. In lieu of issuing fractional shares of Common Stock, the Company paid $319 in cash to holders of\nwarrants who would otherwise have been entitled to receive fractional shares, after aggregating all such fractional shares\nof such holder, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share multiplied by the last sale price of a share of the\nCompany’s Common Stock on December 16, 2022. In connection with the Warrant Exchange, the Company capitalized\n$2.3 million of offering expenses within additional paid-in capital in December 2022, which resulted in a reduction to\nadditional paid-in capital.\nIn connection with the Warrant Exchange, the 3,800,000 Private Warrants exchanged for Common Stock as discussed\nabove, were marked to their estimated fair value of approximately $23.6 million through the Warrant Exchange closing\ndate on December 22, 2022 with the change in the estimated fair value during the year ended December 31, 2022\nrecognized as change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive\nincome (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022. On the closing date of the Warrant Exchange, the estimated fair\nvalue of the exchanged Private Warrants of approximately $23.6 million were reclassified to additional paid-in-capital\nwithin the stockholders’ equity section from warrant liabilities, which resulted in a reduction to warrant liabilities and an\nincrease to additional paid-in-capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nCommon Stock in Treasury\nOn August 15, 2019, the Company’s board of directors approved the 2019 Share Repurchase Program (“2019 Plan”),\nauthorizing the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our Common Stock from August 30, 2019 to August 15, 2020.

The stock repurchase program does\nnot obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares, and the timing and exact amount of any repurchases\nwill depend on various factors, including market pricing and conditions, business, legal, accounting, and other\nconsiderations.\nThe Company may repurchase its shares in open market transactions from time to time or through privately negotiated\ntransactions in accordance with federal securities laws, at the Company’s discretion. The repurchase program, which has\nno expiration date, may be increased, suspended, or terminated at any time. The program is expected to be implemented\nover the course of several years and is conducted subject to the covenants in the agreements governing the Company’s\nindebtedness.

However, such approval to increase the number of shares available for\nissuance under the Plan was received at the 2022 annual meeting as noted below.\nEach PSU awarded under the PSU Agreement represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s Common Stock,\nor, at the Compensation Committee’s sole discretion, cash or part cash and part common stock with the cash amount equal\nto the fair market value of the common stock as of the date on which the restricted period ends. PSUs vest and become\nunrestricted on the third anniversary of the grant date. The number of PSUs that vest range from 0% to 150% of the Target\nLevel (as defined in the PSU Agreement) depending upon the achievement of specified three-year cumulative operating\ncash flow amounts as determined based on the net cash flow from operations disclosed in the Company’s Annual Reports\non Form 10-K for the period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Vesting of PSUs is contingent upon the\nexecutive’s continued employment through the vesting date, unless the executive’s employment is terminated by reason\nof death, without Cause, for Good Reason, or in the event of a Change in Control (each term as defined in the Plan).\nOn May 19, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Plan to increase the number of shares\nauthorized under the plan by 4,000,000 shares. As a result of this, the Company reclassified all of the outstanding liability-\nbased RSUs and PSUs from accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities to additional paid-in capital based on the\nchange in the ability to settle these awards in shares upon vesting as a result of the additional shares added to the Plan. The\nreclassified amount of these awards at the date of this change was approximately $2.4 million and is included in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOn May 24, 2022 and July 12, 2022, the Compensation Committee adopted another form of PSU Award Agreement with\nrespect to awarding PSUs. The award agreement is substantially similar to the PSU agreement adopted on February 24,\n2022 except for the number of PSUs that vest are determined based upon the achievement of specified share prices over\nthe period between the grant date and June 30, 2025. Participants will earn a corresponding number of PSUs upon the\nachievement of specified share price thresholds, the first of which is $12.50 per share. If all Performance Goals (as defined\nin the Agreement) are met during the performance period then the participant will be entitled to receive a maximum number\nof PSUs awarded.\nOn February 28, 2023, the Compensation Committee adopted a new form Executive RSU Agreement and a new form\nExecutive PSU Agreement with respect to the granting of RSUs and PSUs, respectively, under the Plan.

PSUs vest and become unrestricted on the third anniversary of\nthe grant date. The number of PSUs that vest pursuant to the new form Executive PSU Agreement is based on the\nCompany’s Total Shareholder Return (the “TSR Based Award”) performance and the Company’s Diversification EBITDA\n(as defined in the new form Executive PSU Agreement) (the “Diversification EBITDA Based Award”), each measured\nbased on the applicable Performance Period specified in the new form Executive PSU Agreement. The number of PSUs\nthat vest pursuant to the TSR Based Award range from 0% to 200% of the Target Level (as defined in the new form\nExecutive PSU Agreement) depending upon the achievement of a specified percentile rank during the applicable\nPerformance Period. The number of PSUs that vest pursuant to the Diversification EBITDA Based Award range from 0%\nto 200% of the Target Level (as defined in the new form Executive PSU Agreement) depending upon the Company’s\nQualifying EBITDA (as defined in the new form Executive PSU Agreement) during the applicable Performance Period.\nVesting of PSUs is contingent upon the executive’s continued employment through the vesting date, unless the executive’s\n105\nemployment is terminated by reason of death, without Cause, for Good Reason, or in the event of a Change in Control\n(each term as defined in the Plan).\nRestricted Stock Units\nBeginning on May 21, 2019, the Compensation Committee began granting time-based RSUs to the Company’s executive\nofficers, certain other employees, and directors. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive, upon vesting, one share\nof the Company’s Common Stock or its cash equivalent, as determined by the Compensation Committee. These RSU\nawards granted to executive officers and other employees generally vest in four equal installments on each of the first four\nanniversaries of the grant date, except for the RSUs granted on February 25, 2021 discussed below, whereby 50% vest on\nthe second grant date anniversary and 50% vest on the third grant date anniversary.

Each PSU awarded under the Agreement represents the right to receive\none share of the Company’s common stock. The PSUs awarded pursuant to the Archer PSU Agreement vest and become\nunrestricted on June 30, 2025. The number of PSUs that vest are determined based upon the achievement of specified\nshare prices over the period between the grant date and June 30, 2025 (the “Performance Period”). Mr. Archer will earn a\ncorresponding number of PSUs upon the achievement of specified share price thresholds, the first of which is $12.50 per\nshare. If all Performance Goals (as defined in the Archer PSU Agreement) are met during the Performance Period,\nMr. Archer will be entitled to receive a maximum of 500,000 PSUs.

Stock-based compensation expense for these\nstock option awards recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $0.8 million with an associated\ntax benefit of approximately $0.2 million. Stock-based compensation expense for these stock option awards recognized in\nselling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year\nended December 31, 2021 was approximately $0.8 million with an associated tax benefit of approximately $0.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options totaled approximately $0.1 million\nand is expected to be recognized over a remaining term of approximately 0.18 years.\nThe fair value of each option award at the grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the\nfollowing assumptions:\nAssumptions\nWeighted average expected stock volatility (range) 25.94–30.90%\nExpected dividend yield 0.00%\nExpected term (years) 6.25%\nRisk-free interest rate (range) 0.82–2.26\nExercise price (range) $ 4.51–10.83\nThe volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is based on peer group volatility as the Company\ndoes not have a sufficient trading history as a stand-alone public company to calculate volatility. Additionally, due to an\ninsufficient history with respect to stock option activity and post vesting cancellations, the expected term assumption is\nbased on the simplified method permitted under SEC rules, whereby, the simple average of the vesting period for each\ntranche of award and its contractual term is aggregated to arrive at a weighted average expected term for the award. The\n109\nrisk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the implied US Treasury bill yield curve at the date of\ngrant with a remaining term equal to the Company’s expected term assumption. The Company has never declared or paid\na dividend on its shares of common stock.\nStock-based payments are subject to service based vesting requirements and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nStock Appreciation Right Awards\nOn February 25, 2021, the Compensation Committee granted SARs to certain of the Company’s executive officers and\nother employees. Each SAR represents a contingent right to receive, upon vesting, payment in cash or the Company’s\nCommon Stock, as determined by the Compensation Committee, in an amount equal to the difference between (a) the fair\nmarket value of a Common Share on the date of exercise, over (b) the grant date price. The number of SARs granted to\ncertain named executive officers and certain other employees totaled 1,578,537 (including 26,906 granted on August 5,\n2021).\nAs approved by the Compensation Committee, 755,436 of the employee related exercised SARs shown in the table below\nwere paid in cash in the amount of $10.0 million based on the difference between (a) the fair market value of a share of\nCommon Stock on the date of exercise, over (b) the grant date price; during the first quarter of 2023.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, as approved by the Compensation Committee, 13,453 of the employee related exercised\nSARs shown in the table below were paid in cash in the amount of $0.1 million based on the difference between (a) the\nfair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise, over (b) the grant price.\nThe following table summarizes SARs outstanding at December 31, 2023:\nWeighted-Average\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual\nNumber of Units Exercise Price Term (Years)\nOutstanding SARs at December 31, 2022 1,537,776 $ 1.82 8.17\nForfeited (54,348) 1.79 -\nExercised (768,889) 1.82 -\nOutstanding SARs at December 31, 2023 714,539 $ 1.82 7.17\nUnder the authoritative guidance for stock-based compensation, these SARs are considered liability-based awards. The\nCompany recognized a liability, associated with its SARs of approximately $5.4 million as of December 31, 2023, all of\nwhich is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. The\nliability associated with these SAR awards recognized as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $12.6 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, of which approximately $6.3 million is included in accrued liabilities and approximately $6.3 million\nis included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. These\nSARs were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions on the grant date: the\nexpected volatility was approximately 43.5%, the term was 6.25 years, the dividend yield was 0.0% and the risk-free rate\nwas approximately 1.07%, which resulted in a calculated fair value of approximately $0.78 per SAR as of the grant date.\nThe fair value of these liability awards will be remeasured at each reporting period until the date of settlement. At\nDecember 31, 2023, these SARs were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following\nassumptions for awards granted on February 25, 2021 and August 5, 2021, respectively: the expected volatility was\napproximately 35.78% and 53.39%, the term was 0.08 years and 0.30 years, the dividend yield was 0.0% and 0.0%, the\nrisk-free rate was approximately 5.52% and 5.33%, and the exercise price was $1.79 and $3.54, which resulted in a\ncalculated fair value of approximately $7.95 and $6.25 per SAR, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. At December 31,\n2022, these SARs were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for awards\ngranted on February 25, 2021 and August 5, 2021, respectively: the expected volatility was approximately 46.86% and\n47.27%, the term was 0.65 years and 1.10 years, the dividend yield was 0.0% and 0.0%, the risk-free rate was\napproximately 4.70% and 4.65%, and the exercise price was $1.79 and $3.54, which resulted in a calculated fair value of\napproximately $13.40 and $11.78 per SAR, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\n110\nThe estimated weighted-average fair value of each SAR as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $7.96 and\n$13.61, respectively. Increases and decreases in stock-based compensation expense are recognized over the vesting period,\nor immediately for vested awards. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized compensation expense\nrelated to these awards of approximately $2.9 million in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income (loss). For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized compensation\nexpense related to these awards of approximately $11.4 million in selling, general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized\ncompensation expense related to these awards of approximately $1.2 million in selling, general and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation\nexpense related to SARs totaled approximately $0.8 million and is expected to be recognized over a remaining term of\napproximately 0.18 years. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the intrinsic value of the SARs was $5.6 million\nand $20.5 million, respectively.\nThe volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is based on peer group volatility as the Company\ndoes not have a sufficient trading history as a stand-alone public company to calculate volatility. Additionally, due to an\ninsufficient history with respect to stock appreciation right activity and post vesting cancellations, the expected term\nassumption on the grant date is based on the simplified method permitted under SEC rules, whereby, the simple average\nof the vesting period for each tranche of award and its contractual term is aggregated to arrive at a weighted average\nexpected term for the award. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the implied US\nTreasury bill yield curve at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the Company’s expected term assumption.\nThe Company has never declared or paid a dividend on its shares of common stock.\nStock-based payments are subject to service based vesting requirements and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n19. Retirement Plans\nWe offer a defined contribution 401(k) retirement plan to substantially all of our U.S. employees. Participants may\ncontribute from 1% to 90% of eligible compensation, inclusive of pretax and/or Roth deferrals (subject to Internal Revenue\nService limitations), and we make matching contributions under this plan on the first 5% of the participant’s compensation\n(100% match of the first 3% employee contribution and 50% match on the next 2% contribution). Our matching\ncontributions fully vest upon participation. We recognized expense of $1.1 million, $0.9 million and $0.7 million related\nto matching contributions under our various defined contribution plans during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\n20. Business Segments\nThe Company has six operating segments, none of which qualify for aggregation. Four of the segments were disclosed as\nreportable segments in 2022, based on the 10% tests. The aggregate external revenues of these reportable segments\nexceeded 75% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. The remaining operating segments were combined in the “All\nOther” category. In 2023, two of the four operating segments (“TCPL Keystone” and “HFS–Midwest”) that were disclosed\nas reportable segments in 2022 became quantitatively immaterial as they did not exceed the threshold for any of the 10%\ntests and are now combined in the “All Other” category in 2023. As such, in 2023 and for all comparison periods, the\nCompany has two reportable segments and the aggregate external revenues of these two reportable segments exceed 75%\nof the Company’s consolidated revenues in all periods presented.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company changed the names of select reportable segments to appropriately align with its\ndiversified hospitality and facilities service offerings. The segments formerly known as Permian Basin and Bakken Basin\nare now referred to as HFS–South and HFS–Midwest, respectively. As mentioned above, the HFS–Midwest segment is\nnow combined in the “All Other” category in 2023. All other reportable segment names remain unchanged.\nThe Company is organized primarily on the basis of geographic region and customer industry group and operates in two\nreportable segments. These reportable segments are also operating segments. Resources are allocated, and performance is\nassessed by our CEO, whom we have determined to be our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).\n111\nOur remaining operating segments have been consolidated and included in an “All Other” category.\nThe following is a brief description of our reportable segments and a description of business activities conducted by All\nOther.\nHFS–South—Segment operations consist primarily of specialty rental and vertically integrated hospitality services\nrevenue from customers in the natural resources and development industry located primarily in Texas and New Mexico.\nGovernment—Segment operations consist primarily of specialty rental and vertically integrated hospitality services\nrevenue from customers with Government contracts located in Texas.\nAll Other—Segment operations consist primarily of revenue from specialty rental and vertically integrated hospitality\nservices revenue from customers primarily in the natural resources and development industry located outside of the\nHFS–South segment.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the “Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies” for the Company in Note 1. The Company evaluates performance of their segments and allocates resources to\nthem based on revenue and adjusted gross profit. Adjusted gross profit for the CODM’s analysis includes the services and\nspecialty rental costs in the financial statements and excludes depreciation, loss on impairment, and certain severance\ncosts.\nThe table below presents information about reported segments for the years ended December 31:\n2023\nHFS–South Government All Other Total\nRevenue $ 148,677 $ 403,724 $ 11,207 (a) $ 563,608\nAdjusted gross profit $ 51,444 $ 332,480 $ (1,974) $ 381,950\nCapital expenditures $ 33,729 $ 30,363 $ 514\nTotal Assets $ 184,453 $ 207,409 $ 30,987 $ 422,849\n2022\nHFS–South Government All Other Total\nRevenue $ 132,373 $ 360,294 $ 9,318 (a) $ 501,985\nAdjusted gross profit $ 54,558 $ 246,598 $ (1,195) $ 299,961\nCapital expenditures $ 8,686 $ 130,871 $ 339\nTotal Assets $ 176,637 $ 217,029 $ 34,722 $ 428,388\n2021\nHFS–South Government All Other Total\nRevenue $ 116,958 $ 156,250 $ 18,129 (a) $ 291,337\nAdjusted gross profit $ 52,344 $ 94,801 $ 7,814 $ 154,959\nCapital expenditures $ 8,835 $ 27,525 $ 207\n(a) Revenues from operating segments below the quantitative thresholds are reported in the “All Other” category\npreviously described.\n112\nA reconciliation of total segment adjusted gross profit to total consolidated income (loss) before income taxes for years\nended as of the dates indicated below, is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 De cember 31, 2021\nTotal reportable segment adjusted gross profit $ 383,924 $ 301,156 $ 147,145\nOther adjusted gross profit (1,974) (1,195) 7,814\nDepreciation and amortization (83,977) (67,665) (70,519)\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses (56,126) (57,893) (46,461)\nOther income (expense), net (1,241) (36) (880)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (2,279) - -\nInterest expense, net (22,639) (36,323) (38,704)\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 9,062 (31,735) (1,067)\nConsolidated income (loss) before income taxes $ 224,750 $ 106,309 $ (2,672)\nA reconciliation of total segment assets to total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is as\nfollows:\n2023 2022\nTotal reportable segment assets $ 391,862 $ 393,666\nOther assets 32,871 36,399\nOther unallocated amounts 269,620 341,662\nTotal Assets $ 694,353 $ 771,727\nOther unallocated assets are not included in the measure of segment assets provided to or reviewed by the CODM for\nassessing performance and allocating resources, and as such, are not allocated.

Commencing on January 5, 2024\nthrough March 8, 2024, the Company repurchased 1,895,463 shares of Common Stock for an aggregated price of\napproximately $17.8 million. This repurchase program may be suspended from time to time, modified, extended or\ndiscontinued at certain times.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nThere were no changes in or disagreements on any matters of accounting principles or financial statement disclosure\nbetween us and our independent auditors during our two most recent fiscal years or any subsequent interim period.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required\nto be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed\nor submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, the Company’s management, under the supervision and\nwith the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by\nthis annual report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated\nto our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon this evaluation, the Company’s management and our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of December 31, 2023 at the reasonable\nassurance level.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors, and (iii) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could\nhave a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAccordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving\ntheir control objectives.\nUnder the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an assessment\nof the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment,\nmanagement used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).

(“Arrow”), an affiliate of TDR, to acquire all of\nthe outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company that are not owned by any of Arrow, any investment fund managed by TDR or any of their respective affiliates (the\n“Unaffiliated Shares”), for cash consideration of $10.80 per share (the “Proposal”).
