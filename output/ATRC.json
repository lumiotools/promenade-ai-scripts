Our results are a testament to our commitment to expand access to our innovative solutions for patients and providers worldwide.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter 2024 was $115.9 million, an increase of 17.9% over third quarter 2023 revenue (17.8% on a constant currency basis), reflecting continued adoption of our products by physicians globally for the treatment of patients with Afib, LAA management and post-operative pain management. On a sequential basis, worldwide revenue for the third quarter 2024 decreased approximately 0.3% from the second quarter 2024 due to normal seasonality of procedures in summer months. \n\nU.S. revenue was $95.5 million, an increase of $13.8 million or 16.8%, compared to the third quarter 2023. U.S. revenue growth was driven by sales across key product lines, including the ENCOMPASS® clamp in open ablation, AtriClip® Flex·V® device in appendage management and cryoSPHERE® probes for post-operative pain management. International revenue increased $3.9 million or 23.3% (22.4% on a constant currency basis) to $20.5 million, realizing significant growth across all franchises in Europe and most of our other major geographic regions. \n\nGross profit for the third quarter 2024 was $86.8 million compared to $73.9 million for the third quarter 2023. Gross margin was 74.9% for the third quarter 2024, a decrease of 27 basis points from the third quarter 2023, reflecting less favorable geographic and product mix. Loss from operations for the third quarter 2024 was $7.4 million, compared to $8.1 million for the third quarter 2023. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.17 for the third quarter 2024, compared to $0.20 for the third quarter 2023. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2024 is $7.9 million, an increase of $3.2 million from third quarter of 2023. Adjusted loss per share for the third quarter 2024 was $0.17, compared to $0.20 for the third quarter 2023. \n\nConstant currency revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures. We discuss these non-GAAP financial measures and provide reconciliations to GAAP measures later in this release. \n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nAtriCure now expects full year 2024 revenue of approximately $459 million to $462 million, reflecting growth of approximately 15% to 16%. Management continues to expect full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $26 million to $29 million, with improvements annually thereafter. Projected full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA represents a 34% to 49% increase over full year 2023. Full year 2024 adjusted loss per share is expected to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.80. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAtriCure will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, October 29, 2024 to discuss third quarter 2024 financial results.

This press release also includes forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts. Actual results could differ materially. For details on the uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements, visit [http://www.atricure.com/forward-looking-statements](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atricure.com%2Fforward-looking-statements&esheet=54143878&newsitemid=20241029706905&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.atricure.com%2Fforward-looking-statements&index=4&md5=3b4981f9901042de3531df7cc0f3f2f2) as well as our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q which contain risk factors. Except where otherwise noted, the information contained in this release is as of October 29, 2024. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this release as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as may be required by law. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement AtriCure’s condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, AtriCure provides certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release as supplemental financial metrics. \n\nRevenue reported on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure, calculated by applying previous period foreign currency exchange rates to each of the comparable periods. Management analyzes revenue on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on revenue, the Company believes that evaluating growth in revenue on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of revenue to both management and investors. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) before other income/expense (including interest), income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, acquisition costs, legal settlement costs, impairment of intangible assets and change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Management believes in order to properly understand short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of these excluded items in addition to GAAP measures. The excluded items vary in frequency and/or impact on our continuing results of operations and management believes that the excluded items are typically not reflective of our ongoing core business operations and financial condition. Further, management uses adjusted EBITDA for both strategic and annual operating planning. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA reported in this release to the most comparable GAAP measure for the respective periods appears in the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Income (Adjusted EBITDA)” later in this release. \n\nAdjusted loss per share is a non-GAAP measure which calculates the net loss per share before non-cash adjustments in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, impairment of intangible assets, debt extinguishment and legal settlements. A reconciliation of adjusted loss per share reported in this release to the most comparable GAAP measure for the respective periods appears in the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Loss Per Share” later in this release. \n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used by AtriCure may not be the same or calculated in the same manner as those used and calculated by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for AtriCure’s financial results prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financials measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. \n\n**ATRICURE, INC.
