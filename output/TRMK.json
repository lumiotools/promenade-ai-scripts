The discontinued operations results are presented as a single line item below\nincome from continuing operations and as separate lines in the balance sheet in the accompanying tables for all periods presented.\nFinancial results from adjusted continuing operations(1) exclude significant non-routine transactions.\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share payable December 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on\nDecember 1, 2024.\nThird Quarter Highlights\n• Net income from adjusted continuing operations(1) increased $10.8 million, or 26.7%, linked-quarter to $51.3 million\n• Net interest income (FTE) increased $13.7 million, or 9.5%, linked-quarter to $158.0 million, resulting in a net interest margin of\n3.69%, up 31 basis points from the prior quarter\n• Loans held for investment (HFI) totaled $13.1 billion, a decrease of $55.3 million, or 0.4%, from the prior quarter and an increase\nof $289.9 million, or 2.3%, year-over-year\n• Deposits totaled $15.2 billion, down $222.0 million, or 1.4%, linked-quarter, and up $139.0 million, or 0.9%, year-over-year;\nexcluding targeted reductions in public and brokered deposits totaling $529.7 million, deposits increased $307.7 million, or 2.1%,\nlinked-quarter\n• Achieved return on average tangible equity of 12.86% and return on average assets of 1.10%\n• Efficiency ratio improved 282 basis points to 60.99% in the third quarter\nDuane A. Dewey, President and CEO, stated, “Trustmark’s third quarter results reflect significant achievement across the\norganization. Profitability meaningfully increased as evidenced by the 26.7% growth in net income from adjusted continuing\noperations(1) and a 282 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio. The restructuring of the investment securities portfolio in the\nsecond quarter was a major contributor to the 9.5% increase in net interest income in the third quarter. These accomplishments are the\nresult of focused efforts to enhance Trustmark’s long-term performance and competitiveness. We continue to implement technology\nand streamline processes to enhance our ability to grow and serve customers. Trustmark is well-positioned to compete in changing\neconomic conditions and create long-term value for our shareholders.”\nBalance Sheet Management\n• Loans HFI totaled $13.1 billion, down 0.4% from the prior quarter and up 2.3% year-over-year\n• Deposits totaled $15.2 billion, down 1.4% from the previous quarter and up 0.9% year-over-year\n• Enhanced strong capital position with CET1 ratio of 11.30% and total risk-based capital ratio of 13.71%\nLoans HFI totaled $13.1 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of $55.3 million, or 0.4%, linked-quarter and an increase\nof $289.9 million, or 2.3%, year-over-year. The linked-quarter change reflected decreases in commercial and industrial loans, state and\nother political subdivision loans, and commercial real estate loans offset in part by increases in other real estate secured loans, other\nloans and leases (equipment finance), and 1-4 family mortgage loans. Trustmark’s loan portfolio continues to be well-diversified by\nloan type and geography.\nDeposits totaled $15.2 billion at September 30, 2024, down $222.0 million, or 1.4%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $139.0\nmillion, or 0.9%, year-over-year.

The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 6 basis points\nto 2.81% for the third quarter, while the cost of total deposits was 2.22%, up 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The total cost of\ninterest-bearing liabilities was 2.94% for the third quarter, down 1 basis point linked-quarter.\nAs previously announced, Trustmark’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective January 1, 2024, under which\n$50.0 million of Trustmark’s outstanding shares may be acquired through December 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Trustmark\nhad not repurchased any of its outstanding common shares under this program.

Tangible book value per share was $26.88 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.5% from the\nprior quarter and 32.9% from the prior year.\nCredit Quality\n• Net charge-offs totaled $4.7 million in the third quarter, representing 0.14% of average loans\n• Net provision for credit losses totaled $6.5 million for the third quarter\n• Allowance for credit losses (ACL) represented 1.21% of loans HFI and 497.27% of nonaccrual loans, excluding individually\nevaluated loans at September 30, 2024\nNonaccrual loans totaled $73.8 million at September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of $29.5 million from the prior quarter and a decline\nof $17.1 million year-over-year. Other real estate totaled $3.9 million, reflecting a decrease of $2.7 million from the prior quarter and\n$1.6 million from the prior year.

Nonperforming assets represented 0.58% of loans HFI and loans held for\nsale at September 30, 2024.\nThe net provision for credit losses totaled $6.5 million in the third quarter compared to $19.7 million in the second quarter (which\nincluded a $8.6 million provision related to the Mortgage Loan Sale) and $8.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The provision for\ncredit losses for loans HFI was $7.9 million in the third quarter and was primarily attributable to specific reserves for individually\nanalyzed credits and net adjustments to the qualitative factors. The provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures was\na negative $1.4 million, primarily driven by decreases in unfunded commitments.\nAllocation of Trustmark’s $157.9 million ACL on loans HFI represented 1.08% of commercial loans and 1.64% of consumer and home\nmortgage loans, resulting in an ACL to total loans HFI of 1.21% at September 30, 2024. Management believes the level of the ACL is\ncommensurate with the credit losses currently expected in the loan portfolio.\nRevenue Generation\n• Total revenue expanded to $192.3 million in the third quarter\n• Net interest income (FTE) totaled $158.0 million in the third quarter, up 9.5% linked-quarter\n• Noninterest income totaled $37.6 million in the third quarter\nTotal revenue in the third quarter was $192.3 million; in the second quarter total revenue was negative $0.3 million while revenue from\nadjusted continuing operations(1) was $179.3 million; total revenue from adjusted continuing operations(1) increased $13.0 million, or\n7.3%, linked-quarter.\nNet interest income (FTE) in the third quarter totaled $158.0 million, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.69%, up 31 basis points from\nthe prior quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was primarily due to increased yields on the securities portfolio, while the loans\nHFI and held for sale portfolio remained relatively flat, offset by the increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits.\nNoninterest income in the third quarter totaled $37.6 million; in the second quarter noninterest income was a negative $141.3 million\nwhile noninterest income from adjusted continuing operations(1) totaled $38.2 million.

Mortgage banking revenue totaled $6.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of $1.9 million linked-quarter and a decrease of\n$0.3 million year-over-year. The linked-quarter increase was principally attributable to decreased net negative hedge ineffectiveness,\nwhich was offset in part by lower gains on sale of mortgage loans.\nWealth management revenue in the third quarter totaled $9.3 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 4.2%, from the prior quarter and an\nincrease of $0.5 million, or 5.9%, year-over-year. The linked-quarter change reflected a seasonal decline in trust management and\ninvestment services revenue while the year-over-year increase reflected expanded brokerage revenue.\nNoninterest Expense\n• Noninterest expense increased $4.9 million, or 4.2%, linked-quarter\n• Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $1.9 million, or 2.9%, linked quarter, reflecting annual merit increases, annual\nincentive accruals, and commissions\n• Other real estate expense, net increased $2.1 million, all of which relates to the establishment of a reserve for a single property\nNoninterest expense in the third quarter totaled $123.3 million, an increase of $4.9 million, or 4.2%, when compared to the prior quarter\nand a year-over-year decline of $0.5 million, or 0.4%, excluding the litigation settlement expense incurred in the third quarter of 2023.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $1.9 million, or 2.9%, linked-quarter principally due to annual merit increases\neffective July 1, mortgage banking commissions and annual incentive-based accruals as a result of strong operating\nperformance. Salaries and employee benefits expense in the third quarter declined $0.7 million, or 1.0%, from levels one year\nearlier. Other expense totaled $17.3 million in the third quarter, an increase of $2.1 million linked-quarter and $2.3 million year-over-\nyear. The linked-quarter and year-over-year changes are attributable to an increase in other real estate expense, net related to the\nestablishment of a reserve for a single property under contract to sell in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n(1) Please refer to Consolidated Financial Information, Note 1 – Significant Non-Routine Transactions and Note 7 – Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures.\nSignificant Non-Routine Transactions in the Second Quarter\n• Completed sale of FBBI, producing a gain on sale of $228.3 million ($171.2 million, net of taxes)\n• Restructured investment securities portfolio; sold available for sale securities of $1.6 billion with an average yield of 1.36%, which\ngenerated a loss of $182.8 million ($137.1 million, net of taxes); purchased $1.4 billion of available for sale securities with an\naverage yield of 4.85%\n• Sold a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at time of selection totaling\n$56.2 million (Mortgage Loan Sale) which generated a loss of $13.4 million ($10.1 million, net of taxes); sale drove a $54.1 million\nreduction in nonperforming loans\n• Exchanged Visa Class B-1 shares for Visa Class B-2 shares and Visa Class C common stock; Visa Class C stock exchange resulted\nin a gain of $8.1 million ($6.0 million, net of taxes)\nAdditional Information\nAs previously announced, Trustmark will conduct a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, October 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Central\nTime to discuss the Corporation’s financial results.

Trustmark National Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of\nTrustmark Corporation. Trustmark recognized a gain on the sale of $228.3 million ($171.2 million, net of taxes) in income from discontinued operations.\nThe operations of FBBI are also included in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods.\n• Trustmark restructured its investment securities portfolio by selling $1.561 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 1.36%, which\ngenerated a loss of $182.8 million ($137.1 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income in securities gains (losses), net. Trustmark\npurchased $1.378 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 4.85%.\n• Trustmark sold a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at the time of selection totaling $56.2\nmillion, which resulted in a loss of $13.4 million ($10.1 million, net of taxes). The portion of the loss related to credit totaled $8.6 million and was recorded\nas adjustments to charge-offs and the provision for credit losses. The noncredit-related portion of the loss totaled $4.8 million and was recorded to\nnoninterest income in other, net.\n• On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer expiring on May 3, 2024, for any and all outstanding shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock\n(Visa B-1 shares). Holders participating in the exchange offer would receive a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock (Visa B-2 shares) and Visa\nClass C common stock (Visa C shares) in exchange for Visa B-1 shares that are validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa. TNB tendered its\n38.7 thousand Visa B-1 shares, which was accepted by Visa. In exchange for each Visa B-1 share that was validly tendered and accepted for exchange by\nVisa, TNB received 50.0% of a newly issued Visa B-2 share and newly issued Visa C shares equivalent in value to 50.0% of a Visa B-1 share.

interest margin which equals reported net interest income-FTE, annualized, as\na percent of average earning assets.\nThe net interest margin increased 31 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2024, totaling 3.69% for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to increased\nyields on the securities portfolio, while the loans held for investment and held for sale portfolio remained relatively flat, offset by the increase in the cost of interest-\nbearing deposits.\nNote 5 – Mortgage Banking\nTrustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that\noffsets the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) attributable to interest rates. These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not\notherwise qualify for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Changes in the fair value of these exchange-traded derivative instruments,\nincluding administrative costs, are recorded in noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the MSR. The MSR fair\nvalue represents the present value of future cash flows, which among other things includes decay and the effect of changes in interest rates. Ineffectiveness of hedging\nthe MSR fair value is measured by comparing the change in value of hedge instruments to the change in the fair value of the MSR asset attributable to changes in interest\nrates and other market driven changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. The impact of this strategy resulted in a net negative hedge ineffectiveness of $2.5 million\nduring the third quarter of 2024.\nThe following table illustrates the components of mortgage banking revenues included in noninterest income in the accompanying income statements:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\n9/30/2024 6/30/2024 3/31/2024 12/31/2023 9/30/2023 9/30/2024 9/30/2023\nMortgage servicing income, net $ 7,127 $ 6,993 $ 6,934 $ 6,731 $ 6,916 $ 21,054 $ 20,465\nChange in fair value-MSR from runoff (3,154) (3,447) (1,926) (2,972) (3,203) (8,527) (7,058)\nGain on sales of loans, net 4,648 5,151 5,009 3,913 3,748 14,808 11,432\nMortgage banking income before hedge\nineffectiveness 8,621 8,697 10,017 7,672 7,461 27,335 24,839\nChange in fair value-MSR from market changes (10,406) (1,626) 5,123 (10,224) 6,809 (6,909) 8,735\nChange in fair value of derivatives 7,904 (2,867) (6,225) 8,071 (7,812) (1,188) (12,877)\nNet positive (negative) hedge ineffectiveness (2,502) (4,493) (1,102) (2,153) (1,003) (8,097) (4,142)\nMortgage banking, net $ 6,119 $ 4,204 $ 8,915 $ 5,519 $ 6,458 $ 19,238 $ 20,697\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS\nSeptember 30, 2024\n($ in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nNote 6 – Other Noninterest Income and Expense\nOther noninterest income consisted of the following for the periods presented:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\n9/30/2024 6/30/2024 3/31/2024 12/31/2023 9/30/2023 9/30/2024 9/30/2023\nPartnership amortization for tax credit purposes $ (1,977) $ (1,824) $ (1,834) $ (2,013) $ (1,995) $ (5,635) $ (5,975)\nIncrease in life insurance cash surrender value 1,883 1,860 1,844 1,825 1,784 5,587 5,193\nLoss on sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans — (4,798) — — — (4,798) —\nVisa C shares fair value adjustment — 8,056 — — — 8,056 —\nOther miscellaneous income 3,046 4,167 3,092 2,765 2,610 10,305 8,436\nTotal other, net $ 2,952 $ 7,461 $ 3,102 $ 2,577 $ 2,399 $ 13,515 $ 7,654\nTrustmark invests in partnerships that provide income tax credits on a Federal and/or State basis (i.e., new market tax credits, low-income housing tax credits and historical\ntax credits).

Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Trustmark’s Common Equity\nTier 1 capital includes common stock, capital surplus and retained earnings, and is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated net deferred tax\nliabilities as well as disallowed deferred tax assets and threshold deductions as applicable.\nTrustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation\nof these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark’s capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by\nbanking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders’ equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across\norganizations. In Management’s experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare\ncapital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting\nmethod in accounting for mergers and acquisitions.\nThese calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators. Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures,\nTrustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark,\nthere are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark’s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. Also, there may be limits in the\nusefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto\nin their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS\nSeptember 30, 2024\n($ in thousands except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nNote 7 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures (continued)\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\n9/30/2024 6/30/2024 3/31/2024 12/31/2023 9/30/2023 9/30/2024 9/30/2023\nTANGIBLE EQUITY\nAVERAGE BALANCES\nTotal shareholders' equity $ 1,923,248 $ 1,727,489 $ 1,676,521 $ 1,592,493 $ 1,582,885 $1,776,291 $1,562,551\nLess: Goodwill (334,605) (334,605) (334,605) (334,605) (334,605) (334,605) (334,605)\nIdentifiable intangible assets (168) (195) (224) (253) (287) (196) (349)\nTotal average tangible equity $ 1,588,475 $ 1,392,689 $ 1,341,692 $ 1,257,635 $ 1,247,993 $1,441,490 $1,227,597\nPERIOD END BALANCES\nTotal shareholders' equity $ 1,980,096 $ 1,879,141 $ 1,682,599 $ 1,661,847 $ 1,570,351\nLess: Goodwill (334,605) (334,605) (334,605) (334,605) (334,605)\nIdentifiable intangible assets (153) (181) (208) (236) (269)\nTotal tangible equity (a) $ 1,645,338 $ 1,544,355 $ 1,347,786 $ 1,327,006 $ 1,235,477\nTANGIBLE ASSETS\nTotal assets $18,480,372 $18,452,487 $18,376,612 $18,722,189 $18,390,839\nLess: Goodwill (334,605) (334,605) (334,605) (334,605) (334,605)\nIdentifiable intangible assets (153) (181) (208) (236) (269)\nTotal tangible assets (b) $18,145,614 $18,117,701 $18,041,799 $18,387,348 $18,055,965\nRisk-weighted assets (c) $15,004,024 $15,165,038 $15,257,385 $15,153,263 $15,143,531\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ADJUSTED FOR INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations $ 51,330 $ (100,605) $ 38,173 $ 33,888 $ 30,553 $ (11,102) $ 119,402\nPlus: Intangible amortization net of tax from\ncontinuing operations 21 20 20 25 25 61 192\nNet income (loss) adjusted for intangible amortization $ 51,351 $ (100,585) $ 38,193 $ 33,913 $ 30,578 $ (11,041) $ 119,594\nPeriod end common shares outstanding (d) 61,206,606 61,205,969 61,178,366 61,071,173 61,070,095\nTANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY MEASUREMENTS\nReturn on average tangible equity from\ncontinuing operations (1) 12.86% -29.05% 11.45% 10.70% 9.72% -1.02% 13.03%\nTangible equity/tangible assets (a)/(b) 9.07% 8.52% 7.47% 7.22% 6.84%\nTangible equity/risk-weighted assets (a)/(c) 10.97% 10.18% 8.83% 8.76% 8.16%\nTangible book value (a)/(d)*1,000$ 26.88 $ 25.23 $ 22.03 $ 21.73 $ 20.23\nCOMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL (CET1)\nTotal shareholders' equity $ 1,980,096 $ 1,879,141 $ 1,682,599 $ 1,661,847 $ 1,570,351\nCECL transition adjustment 6,500 6,500 6,500 13,000 13,000\nAOCI-related adjustments 29,045 91,557 227,154 219,723 287,888\nCET1 adjustments and deductions:\nGoodwill net of associated deferred\ntax liabilities (DTLs) (320,757) (320,758) (370,205) (370,212) (370,219)\nOther adjustments and deductions\nfor CET1 (2) (115) (847) (2,588) (2,693) (2,803)\nCET1 capital (e) 1,694,769 1,655,593 1,543,460 1,521,665 1,498,217\nAdditional tier 1 capital instruments\nplus related surplus 60,000 60,000 60,000 60,000 60,000\nTier 1 capital $ 1,754,769 $ 1,715,593 $ 1,603,460 $ 1,581,665 $ 1,558,217\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio (e)/(c) 11.30% 10.92% 10.12% 10.04% 9.89%\n(1) Calculation = ((net income (loss) adjusted for intangible amortization/number of days in period)*number of days in year)/total average tangible equity.\n(2) Includes other intangible assets, net of DTLs, disallowed deferred tax assets (DTAs), threshold deductions and transition adjustments, as applicable.\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS\nSeptember 30, 2024\n($ in thousands except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nNote 7 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures (continued)\nTrustmark discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures because Management uses these measures for business planning purposes, including to manage Trustmark’s\nbusiness against internal projected results of operations and to measure Trustmark’s performance.

(FBBI). As such, second quarter financial results consist of both continuing operations and discontinued operations. The discontinued operations include the financial results of FBBI prior to the sale as well as the gain on sale in the second quarter. The discontinued operations results are presented as a single line item below income from continuing operations in the accompanying tables for all periods presented. Financial results from adjusted continuing operations exclude significant non-routine transactions(1). Trustmark reported net income of $73.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, representing diluted earnings per share of $1.20 and net income from adjusted continuing operations(1) of $40.5 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. \n\nPrinter friendly version of earnings release with consolidated financial statements and notes: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/54097962/en](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F54097962%2Fen&esheet=54097962&newsitemid=20240723250620&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F54097962%2Fen&index=1&md5=86b1f1d8ec48d5f7fd6edac3749b9128). \n\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share payable September 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on September 1, 2024. \n\n**Significant Non-Routine Transactions in the Second Quarter**\n\n  * Completed sale of FBBI, producing a gain on sale of $228.3 million ($171.2 million, net of taxes) \n  * Restructured investment securities portfolio; sold available for sale securities of $1.6 billion with an average yield of 1.36%, which generated a loss of $182.8 million ($137.1 million, net of taxes); purchased $1.4 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 4.85% \n  * Sold a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at time of selection totaling $56.2 million (Mortgage Loan Sale) which generated a loss of $13.4 million ($10.1 million, net of taxes); sale drove a $54.1 million reduction in nonperforming loans \n  * Exchanged Visa Class B-1 shares for Visa Class B-2 shares and Visa Class C common stock; Visa Class C stock exchange resulted in a gain of $8.1 million ($6.0 million, net of taxes) \n\n\n\n**Second Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Loans held for investment (HFI) increased $97.5 million, or 0.7%, from the prior quarter to $13.2 billion; excluding the Mortgage Loan Sale, loans HFI increased $152.4 million, or 1.2%, linked-quarter \n  * Deposits expanded $124.3 million, or 0.8%, linked-quarter to $15.5 billion \n  * Net interest income (FTE) increased $8.1 million, or 6.0%, linked-quarter to $144.3 million, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.38%, up 17 basis points from the prior quarter \n  * Noninterest expense totaled $118.3 million, down $1.3 million, or 1.1%, linked-quarter \n  * Tangible equity to tangible assets ratio increased 105 basis points to 8.52% at June 30, 2024 \n  * Tangible book value per share increased $3.20, or 14.5%, to $25.23 at June 30, 2024 \n\n\n\nDuane A. Dewey, President and CEO, stated, “The second quarter of 2024 was an extremely productive quarter for Trustmark. We closed the previously announced sale of our insurance agency and completed significant balance sheet restructuring to position the company for improved operating performance into the second half of the year and beyond. While completing these non-recurring events, we also performed well in our core banking franchise with continued loan growth, deposit growth, solid fee income and disciplined expense management. The commitment and dedication of our associates across the organization to successfully meet our clients’ financial needs and execute the one-time projects are outstanding, and we believe the company is very well positioned for future opportunities.” \n\n**Balance Sheet Management**\n\n  * Loans HFI totaled $13.2 billion, up 0.7% from the prior quarter and 4.3% year-over-year \n  * Deposits totaled $15.5 billion, up 0.8% from the previous quarter and 3.7% year-over-year \n  * Enhanced strong capital position with CET1 ratio of 10.92% and total risk-based capital ratio of 13.29% \n\n\n\nLoans HFI totaled $13.2 billion at June 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of $97.5 million, or 0.7%, linked-quarter and $541.5 million, or 4.3%, year-over-year. The linked quarter growth reflected increases in construction, development and other land loans, loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties, and other loans and leases offset in part by declines in commercial and industrial loans, other real estate secured loans, and 1-4 family mortgage loans. Trustmark’s loan portfolio continues to be well-diversified by loan type and geography. \n\nDeposits totaled $15.5 billion at June 30, 2024, up $124.3 million, or 0.8%, from the prior quarter and $549.0 million, or 3.7%, year-over-year. Trustmark continues to maintain a strong liquidity position as loans HFI represented 85.1% of total deposits at June 30, 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 20.4% of total deposits at June 30, 2024, compared to 19.8% at March 31, 2024. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 1 basis point to 2.75% for the second quarter, while the cost of total deposits was 2.18%, unchanged from the prior quarter. The total cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 2.95% for the second quarter, up 3 basis points linked-quarter. \n\nDuring the second quarter, Trustmark did not repurchase any of its outstanding common shares. As previously announced, Trustmark’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective January 1, 2024, under which $50.0 million of Trustmark’s outstanding shares may be acquired through December 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, Trustmark had not repurchased any of its outstanding common shares under this program. At June 30, 2024, Trustmark’s tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.52%, up 105 basis points from the prior quarter, while the total risk-based capital ratio was 13.29%, up 87 basis points from the prior quarter. Tangible book value per share was $25.23 at June 30, 2024, an increase of 14.5% from the prior quarter and 24.7% from the prior year. \n\n**Credit Quality**\n\n  * Nonaccrual loans declined 55.0% linked-quarter to $44.3 million, driven by the Mortgage Loan Sale \n  * Net charge-offs totaled $11.6 million for the second quarter; excluding the Mortgage Loan Sale, net charge-offs totaled $3.0 million and represented 0.09% of average loans \n  * Allowance for credit losses (ACL) represented 1.18% of loans HFI and 840.20% of nonaccrual loans HFI, excluding individually analyzed loans, at June 30, 2024 \n\n\n\nNonaccrual loans totaled $44.3 million at June 30, 2024, down $54.1 million from the prior quarter and $30.7 million year-over-year. Other real estate totaled $6.6 million, reflecting a decrease of $1.0 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $5.4 million from the prior year. Collectively, nonperforming assets totaled $50.9 million at June 30, 2024, down $55.1 million, or 52.0%, from the prior quarter and $25.3 million, or 33.2%, from the prior year. \n\nThe total provision for credit losses for loans HFI was $23.3 million in the second quarter. Excluding the Mortgage Loan Sale, the provision for credit losses for loans HFI was $14.7 million and was primarily attributable to credit migration. The provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures was a negative $3.6 million, primarily driven by decreases in unfunded commitments. Collectively, the provision for credit losses, excluding the Mortgage Loan Sale, totaled $11.1 million in the second quarter compared to $7.5 million from the prior quarter and $8.5 million in the second quarter of 2023. \n\nAllocation of Trustmark’s $154.7 million ACL on loans HFI represented 1.05% of commercial loans and 1.59% of consumer and home mortgage loans, resulting in an ACL to total loans HFI of 1.18% at June 30, 2024. Management believes the level of the ACL is commensurate with the credit losses currently expected in the loan portfolio. \n\n**Revenue Generation**\n\n  * Net interest income (FTE) totaled $144.3 million in the second quarter, up 6.0% linked-quarter \n  * GAAP noninterest income was negative $141.3 million in the second quarter while noninterest income from adjusted continuing operations(1) totaled $38.2 million and represented 21.3% of total revenue from adjusted continuing operations(1)\n  * GAAP revenue was negative $0.3 million in the second quarter while revenue from adjusted continuing operations(1) totaled $179.3 million, up $7.1 million, or 4.1%, linked-quarter \n\n\n\nRevenue from adjusted continuing operations(1) in the second quarter totaled $179.3 million, an increase of $7.1 million, or 4.1%, from the prior quarter and $1.5 million, or 0.9%, from the same quarter in the prior year. The linked-quarter increase primarily reflects higher net interest income and solid growth in bank card and other fees and wealth management revenue. \n\nNet interest income (FTE) in the second quarter totaled $144.3 million, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.38%, up 17 basis points from the prior quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was primarily due to increased yields on the securities portfolio and the loans HFI and held for sale portfolio as well as the costs of interest-bearing deposits remaining relatively flat. \n\nNoninterest income from adjusted continuing operations(1) in the second quarter totaled $38.2 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 2.8%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $0.4 million, or 1.1%, year-over-year. Bank card and other fees totaled $9.2 million in the second quarter, up $1.8 million, or 24.2%, linked-quarter and $0.3 million, or 3.5%, year-over-year. The linked-quarter increase reflects expanded customer derivative revenue, interchange revenue, and miscellaneous other revenue. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $10.9 million in the second quarter, relatively unchanged from the prior quarter and up $0.2 million, or 2.1%, year-over-year. Other, net totaled $7.5 million, up $4.4 million linked-quarter as the $8.1 million gain from Visa C exchange was offset in part by the $4.8 million in noncredit-related loss from the Mortgage Loan Sale. Other, net from adjusted continuing operations(1) totaled $4.2 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 35.5%, from the prior quarter. \n\nMortgage loan production in the second quarter totaled $379.5 million, an increase of 38.5% from the prior quarter and a decrease of 12.0% year-over-year. Mortgage banking revenue totaled $4.2 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $4.7 million linked-quarter and $2.4 million year-over-year. The linked-quarter decrease was principally attributable to increased net negative hedge ineffectiveness, which was driven by a higher assumed discount rate on servicing cash flows. \n\nWealth management revenue in the second quarter totaled $9.7 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 8.3%, from the prior quarter and $0.8 million, or 9.1%, year-over-year. The linked-quarter growth reflected increased investment services and trust management revenue while the year-over-year increase reflected expanded brokerage revenue. \n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\n  * Noninterest expense declined $1.3 million, or 1.1%, linked-quarter \n  * Salary and employee benefit expense declined $0.6 million, or 1.0%, linked-quarter \n\n\n\nNoninterest expense in the second quarter totaled $118.3 million, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 1.1%, when compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased $0.6 million, or 1.0%, linked-quarter principally due to reduced compensation expense and the seasonal decline in payroll taxes, which were partially offset by increased commission expense. Other expense declined $0.9 million, or 5.6%, linked-quarter. \n\n(1) Please refer to Consolidated Financial Information, Note 1 – Significant Non-Routine Transactions and Note 7 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures. \n\n**Additional Information**\n\nAs previously announced, Trustmark will conduct a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, July 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Central Time to discuss the Corporation’s financial results.

Trustmark National Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Trustmark Corporation. Trustmark recognized a gain on the sale of $228.3 million ($171.2 million, net of taxes) in income from discontinued operations. The operations of FBBI are also included in discontinued operations for the current and prior periods. \n  * Trustmark restructured its investment securities portfolio by selling $1.561 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 1.36%, which generated a loss of $182.8 million ($137.1 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income in securities gains (losses), net. Trustmark purchased $1.378 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 4.85%. \n  * Trustmark sold a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at the time of selection totaling $56.2 million, which resulted in a loss of $13.4 million ($10.1 million, net of taxes). The portion of the loss related to credit totaled $8.6 million and was recorded as adjustments to charge-offs and the provision for credit losses. The noncredit-related portion of the loss totaled $4.8 million and was recorded to noninterest income in other, net. \n  * On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer expiring on May 3, 2024, for any and all outstanding shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock (Visa B-1 shares). Holders participating in the exchange offer would receive a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock (Visa B-2 shares) and Visa Class C common stock (Visa C shares) in exchange for Visa B-1 shares that are validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa. TNB tendered its 38.7 thousand Visa B-1 shares, which was accepted by Visa. In exchange for each Visa B-1 share that was validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa, TNB received 50.0% of a newly issued Visa B-2 share and newly issued Visa C shares equivalent in value to 50.0% of a Visa B-1 share. The Visa C shares that were received by TNB were recognized at fair value, which resulted in a gain of $8.1 million ($6.0 million, net of taxes) and recorded to noninterest income in other, net during the second quarter of 2024. The Visa B-2 shares were recorded at their nominal carrying value. \n\n\n\n**Note 2 - Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity**\n\nThe following table is a summary of the estimated fair value of securities available for sale and the amortized cost of securities held to maturity: \n\n**_6/30/2024_ ** |  **_3/31/2024_ ** |  **_12/31/2023_ ** |  **_9/30/2023_ ** |  **_6/30/2023_ **  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**_ SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE _ **  \nU.S. Treasury securities  |  $  |  172,955  |  $  |  372,424  |  $  |  372,368  |  $  |  363,476  |  $  |  362,966   \nU.S. Government agency obligations  |  —  |  5,594  |  5,792  |  6,780  |  6,999   \nObligations of states and political subdivisions  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  4,642  |  4,813   \nMortgage-backed securities   \nResidential mortgage pass-through securities   \nGuaranteed by GNMA  |  23,489  |  22,232  |  23,135  |  22,881  |  25,336   \nIssued by FNMA and FHLMC  |  1,060,869  |  1,129,521  |  1,176,798  |  1,171,521  |  1,250,435   \nOther residential mortgage-backed securities   \nIssued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA  |  —  |  79,099  |  86,074  |  90,402  |  98,388   \nCommercial mortgage-backed securities   \nIssued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA  |  364,346  |  93,429  |  98,711  |  106,472  |  122,946   \nTotal securities available for sale  |  $  |  1,621,659  |  $  |  1,702,299  |  $  |  1,762,878  |  $  |  1,766,174  |  $  |  1,871,883   \n**_ SECURITIES HELD TO MATURITY _ **  \nU.S. Treasury securities  |  $  |  29,455  |  $  |  29,261  |  $  |  29,068  |  $  |  28,872  |  $  |  28,679   \nObligations of states and political subdivisions  |  —  |  340  |  340  |  341  |  1,180   \nMortgage-backed securities   \nResidential mortgage pass-through securities   \nGuaranteed by GNMA  |  17,998  |  18,387  |  13,005  |  13,090  |  13,235   \nIssued by FNMA and FHLMC  |  449,781  |  461,457  |  469,593  |  474,003  |  484,679   \nOther residential mortgage-backed securities   \nIssued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA  |  138,951  |  146,447  |  154,466  |  162,031  |  171,002   \nCommercial mortgage-backed securities   \nIssued or guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA  |  744,302  |  759,133  |  759,807  |  759,950  |  759,890   \nTotal securities held to maturity  |  $  |  1,380,487  |  $  |  1,415,025  |  $  |  1,426,279  |  $  |  1,438,287  |  $  |  1,458,665   \n  \nAt June 30, 2024, the net unamortized, unrealized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying balance sheet for securities held to maturity transferred from securities available for sale totaled $52.1 million. \n\nManagement continues to focus on asset quality as one of the strategic goals of the securities portfolio, which is evidenced by the investment of 100.0% of the portfolio in U.S. Treasury securities, GSE-backed obligations and other Aaa rated securities as determined by Moody’s. None of the securities owned by Trustmark are collateralized by assets which are considered sub-prime. Furthermore, outside of stock ownership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and Federal Reserve Bank, Trustmark does not hold any other equity investment in a GSE. \n\n**_TRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND

earning assets and liabilities, along with the net interest margin which equals reported net interest income-FTE, annualized, as a percent of average earning assets. \n\nThe net interest margin increased 17 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2024, totaling 3.38% for the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to increased yields on the securities portfolio and the loans held for investment and held for sale portfolio as well as the costs of interest-bearing deposits remaining relatively flat. \n\n**Note 5 – Mortgage Banking**\n\nTrustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that offsets the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) attributable to interest rates. These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Changes in the fair value of these exchange-traded derivative instruments, including administrative costs, are recorded in noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the MSR. The MSR fair value represents the present value of future cash flows, which among other things includes decay and the effect of changes in interest rates. Ineffectiveness of hedging the MSR fair value is measured by comparing the change in value of hedge instruments to the change in the fair value of the MSR asset attributable to changes in interest rates and other market driven changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. The impact of this strategy resulted in a net negative hedge ineffectiveness of $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2024. \n\nThe following table illustrates the components of mortgage banking revenues included in noninterest income in the accompanying income statements: \n\n**_Quarter Ended_ ** |  **_Six Months Ended_ **  \n---|---  \n**_6/30/2024_ ** |  **_3/31/2024_ ** |  **_12/31/2023_ ** |  **_9/30/2023_ ** |  **_6/30/2023_ ** |  **_6/30/2024_ ** |  **_6/30/2023_ **  \nMortgage servicing income, net  |  $  |  6,993  |  $  |  6,934  |  $  |  6,731  |  $  |  6,916  |  $  |  6,764  |  $  |  13,927  |  $  |  13,549   \nChange in fair value-MSR from runoff  |  (3,447  |  )  |  (1,926  |  )  |  (2,972  |  )  |  (3,203  |  )  |  (2,710  |  )  |  (5,373  |  )  |  (3,855  |  )   \nGain on sales of loans, net  |  5,151  |  5,009  |  3,913  |  3,748  |  3,887  |  10,160  |  7,684   \nMortgage banking income before hedge   \nineffectiveness  |  8,697  |  10,017  |  7,672  |  7,461  |  7,941  |  18,714  |  17,378   \nChange in fair value-MSR from market changes  |  (1,626  |  )  |  5,123  |  (10,224  |  )  |  6,809  |  5,898  |  3,497  |  1,926   \nChange in fair value of derivatives  |  (2,867  |  )  |  (6,225  |  )  |  8,071  |  (7,812  |  )  |  (7,239  |  )  |  (9,092  |  )  |  (5,065  |  )   \nNet positive (negative) hedge ineffectiveness  |  (4,493  |  )  |  (1,102  |  )  |  (2,153  |  )  |  (1,003  |  )  |  (1,341  |  )  |  (5,595  |  )  |  (3,139  |  )   \nMortgage banking, net  |  $  |  4,204  |  $  |  8,915  |  $  |  5,519  |  $  |  6,458  |  $  |  6,600  |  $  |  13,119  |  $  |  14,239   \n  \n**_TRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES_ **  \n---  \n**_NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS_ **  \n**_June 30, 2024_ **  \n**_($ in thousands)_ **  \n**_(unaudited)_ **  \n  \n**Note 6 – Other Noninterest Income and Expense**\n\nOther noninterest income consisted of the following for the periods presented: \n\n**_Quarter Ended_ ** |  **_Six Months Ended_ **  \n---|---  \n**_6/30/2024_ ** |  **_3/31/2024_ ** |  **_12/31/2023_ ** |  **_9/30/2023_ ** |  **_6/30/2023_ ** |  **_6/30/2024_ ** |  **_6/30/2023_ **  \nPartnership amortization for tax credit purposes  |  $  |  (1,824  |  )  |  $  |  (1,834  |  )  |  $  |  (2,013  |  )  |  $  |  (1,995  |  )  |  $  |  (2,019  |  )  |  $  |  (3,658  |  )  |  $  |  (3,980  |  )   \nIncrease in life insurance cash surrender value  |  1,860  |  1,844  |  1,825  |  1,784  |  1,716  |  3,704  |  3,409   \nLoss on sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans  |  (4,798  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (4,798  |  )  |  —   \nVisa C shares fair value adjustment  |  8,056  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  8,056  |  —   \nOther miscellaneous income  |  4,167  |  3,092  |  2,765  |  2,610  |  3,038  |  7,259  |  5,826   \nTotal other, net  |  $  |  7,461  |  $  |  3,102  |  $  |  2,577  |  $  |  2,399  |  $  |  2,735  |  $  |  10,563  |  $  |  5,255   \n  \nTrustmark invests in partnerships that provide income tax credits on a Federal and/or State basis (i.e., new market tax credits, low-income housing tax credits and historical tax credits).

Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Trustmark’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock, capital surplus and retained earnings, and is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated net deferred tax liabilities as well as disallowed deferred tax assets and threshold deductions as applicable. \n\nTrustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark’s capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders’ equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across organizations. In Management’s experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions. \n\nThese calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators. Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures, Trustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark’s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures because Management uses these measures for business planning purposes, including to manage Trustmark’s business against internal projected results of operations and to measure Trustmark’s performance. Trustmark views these as measures of our core operating business, which exclude the impact of the items detailed below, as these items are generally not operational in nature. These non-GAAP financial measures also provide another basis for comparing period-to-period results as presented in the accompanying selected financial data table and the audited consolidated financial statements by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. Readers are cautioned that these adjustments are not permitted under GAAP. Trustmark encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. \n\nThe following table presents pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) during the periods presented: \n\n**_Quarter Ended_ ** |  **_Six Months Ended_ **  \n---|---  \n**_6/30/2024_ ** |  **_3/31/2024_ ** |  **_12/31/2023_ ** |  **_9/30/2023_ ** |  **_6/30/2023_ ** |  **_6/30/2024_ ** |  **_6/30/2023_ **  \nNet interest income (GAAP)  |  (a)  |  $  |  141,029  |  $  |  132,830  |  $  |  136,742  |  $  |  138,637  |  $  |  139,904  |  $  |  273,859  |  $  |  277,499   \nNoninterest income (loss) (GAAP)  |  (141,286  |  )  |  39,355  |  36,605  |  36,921  |  37,829  |  (101,931  |  )  |  74,907   \nAdd:  |  Loss on sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans (incl in Other, net)  |  4,798  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  4,798  |  —   \nVisa C shares fair value adjustment (incl in Other, net)  |  (8,056  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (8,056  |  )  |  —   \nSecurities (gains) losses, net  |  182,792  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  182,792  |  —   \nNoninterest income from adjusted continuing   \noperations (Non-GAAP)  |  (b)  |  $  |  38,248  |  $  |  39,355  |  $  |  36,605  |  $  |  36,921  |  $  |  37,829  |  $  |  77,603  |  $  |  74,907   \nAdjusted pre-provision revenue  |  (a)+(b)=(c)  |  $  |  179,277  |  $  |  172,185  |  $  |  173,347  |  $  |  175,558  |  $  |  177,733  |  $  |  351,462  |  $  |  352,406   \nNoninterest expense (GAAP)  |  $  |  118,326  |  $  |  119,664  |  $  |  126,195  |  $  |  130,291  |  $  |  121,621  |  $  |  237,990  |  $  |  239,210   \nLess:  |  Reduction in force expense (incl in Salaries and employee benefits)  |  —  |  —  |  (1,406  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nLitigation settlement expense  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (6,500  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nNoninterest expense from adjusted continuing   \noperations (Non-GAAP)  |  (d)  |  $  |  118,326  |  $  |  119,664  |  $  |  124,789  |  $  |  123,791  |  $  |  121,621  |  $  |  237,990  |  $  |  239,210   \nPPNR (Non-GAAP)  |  (c)-(d)  |  $  |  60,951  |  $  |  52,521  |  $  |  48,558  |  $  |  51,767  |  $  |  56,112  |  $  |  113,472  |  $  |  113,196   \n  \nThe following table presents adjustments to net income (loss) from continuing operations and select financial ratios as reported in accordance with GAAP resulting from significant non-routine items occurring during the periods presented: \n\n**_Quarter Ended_ ** |  **_Six Months Ended_ **  \n---|---  \n**_6/30/2024_ ** |  **_3/31/2024_ ** |  **_12/31/2023_ ** |  **_9/30/2023_ ** |  **_6/30/2023_ ** |  **_6/30/2024_ ** |  **_6/30/2023_ **  \nNet income (loss) (GAAP) from continuing operations  |  $  |  (100,605  |  )  |  $  |  38,173  |  $  |  33,888  |  $  |  30,553  |  $  |  41,204  |  $  |  (62,432  |  )  |  $  |  88,849   \nSignificant non-routine transactions (net of taxes):   \nPCL, LHFI sale of nonperforming 1-4 family  |  6,475  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  6,475  |  —   \nLoss on sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans  |  3,598  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  3,598  |  —   \nVisa C shares fair value adjustment  |  (6,042  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (6,042  |  )  |  —   \nSecurities gains (losses), net  |  137,094  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  137,094  |  —   \nReduction in force expense  |  —  |  —  |  1,055  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nLitigation settlement expense  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  4,875  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nNet income adjusted for significant non-routine   \ntransactions (Non-GAAP)  |  $  |  40,520  |  $  |  38,173  |  $  |  34,943  |  $  |  35,428  |  $  |  41,204  |  $  |  78,693  |  $  |  88,849   \nDiluted EPS from adjusted continuing operations  |  $  |  0.66  |  $  |  0.62  |  $  |  0.57  |  $  |  0.58  |  $  |  0.67  |  $  |  1.28  |  $  |  1.45   \n**_ FINANCIAL RATIOS -

Trustmark’s performance during the first quarter produced a return on average tangible equity of 12.98% and a return on average assets of\n0.89%. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share payable June 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on June 1, 2024.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n• Loans held for investment increased 0.8% linked-quarter and represented 85.1% of total deposits at March 31, 2024\n• Credit quality remained solid\n• Revenue totaled $188.2 million, up 0.9% linked-quarter\n• Noninterest income increased 11.1% linked-quarter, reflecting seasonal increases and the strength of diversified business lines\n• Noninterest expense decreased 3.9% linked-quarter, reflecting on-going expense management priorities\nDuane A. Dewey, President and CEO, stated, “We are off to a great start in 2024. Our first quarter results reflect continued loan growth, solid credit quality, and double-\ndigit increases in noninterest income. In addition, we experienced a meaningful decrease in noninterest expense. These accomplishments are the results of our focused\nefforts to expand customer relationships and diligently manage expenses. Our associates have done a tremendous job of serving customers, building relationships, and\ndemonstrating the value Trustmark can provide as our customers’ financial partner. We are well positioned to serve and expand our customer base and create long-term\nvalue for shareholders.”\nBalance Sheet Management\n• Loans held for investment (HFI) increased $107.4 million, or 0.8%, during the quarter\n• Total deposits decreased $231.2 million, or 1.5%, during the quarter\n• Maintained strong capital position with CET1 ratio of 10.12% and total risk-based capital ratio of 12.42%\nLoans HFI totaled $13.1 billion at March 31, 2024, reflecting an increase of $107.4 million, or 0.8%, linked-quarter and $560.7 million, or 4.5%, year-over-year. The\nlinked-quarter growth reflected increases in commercial real estate and equipment finance loans offset in part by reductions in state and other political subdivision loans\nand consumer loans. Trustmark’s loan portfolio remains well-diversified by loan type and geography.\nDeposits totaled $15.3 billion at March 31, 2024, down $231.2 million, or 1.5%, from the prior quarter and up $554.9 million, or 3.8%, year-over-year. Trustmark\ncontinues to maintain a strong liquidity position as loans HFI represented 85.1% of total deposits at March 31, 2024. Migration into higher-yielding products continued\nto drive a change in deposit mix from noninterest-bearing deposits, which represented 19.8% of total deposits at March 31, 2024. Interest-bearing deposit costs totaled\n2.74% for the first quarter, an increase of 7 basis points linked-quarter, while the total cost of deposits was 2.18%, an increase of 8 basis points linked-quarter. The total\ncost of interest-bearing liabilities in the first quarter was 2.92%, up 3 basis points from the prior quarter.\nDuring the first quarter, Trustmark did not repurchase any of its outstanding common shares. As previously announced, Trustmark’s Board of Directors authorized a\nstock repurchase program effective January 1, 2024, under which $50.0 million of Trustmark’s outstanding shares may be acquired through December 31, 2024. At March\n31, 2024, Trustmark’s tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.20%, while the total risk-based capital ratio was 12.42%. Tangible book value per share was $21.18\nat March 31, 2024, an increase of 1.5% from the prior quarter and 10.1% from the prior year.\nCredit Quality\n• Net charge-offs totaled $4.1 million, representing 0.12% of average loans in the first quarter\n• Provision for credit losses for loans HFI was $7.7 million in the first quarter\n• Allowance for credit losses (ACL) represented 1.10% of loans HFI and 235.29% of nonaccrual loans, excluding individually analyzed loans at March 31,\n2024\nNonaccrual loans totaled $98.4 million at March 31, 2024, down $1.7 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $26.0 million year-over-year. Other real estate\ntotaled $7.6 million, reflecting increases of $753 thousand and $5.9 million from the prior quarter and prior year, respectively. Collectively, nonperforming assets totaled\n$106.0 million, representing 0.80% of loans HFI and held for sale (HFS) at March 31, 2024.\nThe provision for credit losses for loans HFI was $7.7 million in the first quarter and was primarily attributable to loan growth, changes in the macroeconomic forecast,\nand net adjustments to the qualitative factors. The provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures was a negative $192 thousand in the first quarter.\nCollectively, the provision for credit losses totaled $7.5 million in the first quarter compared to $6.7 million in the prior quarter and $1.0 million in the first quarter of\n2023.\nAllocation of Trustmark’s $143.0 million ACL on loans HFI represented 0.93% of commercial loans and 1.63% of consumer and home mortgage loans, resulting in an\nACL to total loans HFI of 1.10% at March 31, 2024. Management believes the level of the ACL is commensurate with the credit losses currently expected in the loan\nportfolio.\nRevenue Generation\n• Net interest income (FTE) totaled $136.2 million in the first quarter, down 2.8% linked-quarter\n• Net interest margin totaled 3.21% in the first quarter, down 4 basis points from the prior quarter\n• Noninterest income increased 11.1% linked-quarter to total $55.3 million, reflecting growth in mortgage banking, insurance, other income, and wealth\nmanagement revenue\nRevenue in the first quarter totaled $188.2 million, an increase of 0.9% from the prior quarter and a decrease of 0.4% from the same quarter in the prior year. The linked-\nquarter increase primarily reflects higher noninterest income offset in part by lower net interest income while the year-over-year decrease is attributed to lower net interest\nincome offset in part by growth in noninterest income.\nNet interest income (FTE) in the first quarter totaled $136.2 million, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.21%, down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The decrease\nin the net interest margin was primarily due to increased costs of interest-bearing liabilities.\nNoninterest income in the first quarter totaled $55.3 million, an increase of $5.5 million, or 11.1%, from the prior quarter and $4.0 million, or 7.7%, year-over-year. The\nlinked-quarter increases in mortgage banking, insurance, other income, and wealth management revenue were offset in part by declines in bank card and other fees and\nservice charges on deposit accounts. The increase in noninterest income year-over-year is broad-based, reflecting increases in mortgage banking, insurance, other income,\nservice charges of deposit accounts and wealth management revenue which were offset in part by declines in bank card and other fees.\nMortgage loan production in the first quarter totaled $274.0 million, up 0.8% from the prior quarter and down 24.1% year-over-year. Mortgage banking revenue totaled\n$8.9 million in the first quarter, an increase of $3.4 million linked-quarter and $1.3 million year-over-year. The linked-quarter increase was principally attributable to\nincreased gain on sales of mortgage loans, improvement in net negative hedge ineffectiveness, and reduced servicing asset amortization. The year-over-year increase was\nprincipally due to increased gain on sales of mortgage loans.\nInsurance revenue totaled $15.5 million in the first quarter, up $2.3 million, or 17.2%, from the prior quarter and $1.2 million, or 8.1%, year-over-year. The linked-\nquarter and year-over-year increases primarily reflected growth in commercial property and casualty commissions. Wealth management revenue in the first quarter totaled\n$9.0 million, an increase of $295 thousand, or 3.4%, from the prior quarter and $172 thousand, or 2.0%, year-over-year. The linked-quarter growth reflected higher trust\nmanagement revenue while the year-over-year growth reflected increased brokerage revenue.\nOther income, net totaled $3.6 million in the first quarter, up $1.1 million from both the prior quarter and year-over-year. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled\n$11.0 million in the first quarter, reflecting a seasonal decrease of $353 thousand, or 3.1%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $622 thousand, or 6.0%, year-over-\nyear. Bank card and other fees totaled $7.4 million in the first quarter, down $1.1 million from the prior quarter due principally to lower customer derivative revenue. Year-\nover-year, bank card and other fees declined $375 thousand.\nNoninterest Expense\n• Total noninterest expense declined $5.3 million, or 3.9%, linked-quarter\n• Salary and employee benefit expense declined $2.5 million, or 3.3%, linked-quarter\n• Total services and fees declined $3.1 million, or 11.0%, linked-quarter\nNoninterest expense in the first quarter totaled $131.1 million, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 3.9%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $2.8 million, or 2.2%, year-\nover-year. Salary and employee benefit expense totaled $75.5 million in the first quarter, a decline of $2.5 million, or 3.3%, linked-quarter and an increase of $1.4 million,\nor 1.9%, year-over-year. The linked-quarter decline reflected reductions in incentives, severance, medical insurance, and salary expense, which were offset in part by a\nseasonal increase in payroll taxes and restricted stock compensation expense. Services and fees in the first quarter totaled $24.8 million, a decrease of $3.1 million, or\n11.0%, from the prior quarter and $587 thousand, or 2.3%, year-over-year. The linked-quarter decline is attributable principally to lower professional fees and data\nprocessing software expense.\nAdditional Information\nAs previously announced, Trustmark will conduct a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, April 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Central Time to discuss the Corporation’s\nfinancial results.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS\nMarch 31, 2024\n($ in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nNote 3 – Yields on Earning Assets and Interest-Bearing Liabilities (continued)\nReflected in the table above are yields on earning assets and liabilities, along with the net interest margin which equals reported net interest income-FTE, annualized, as\na percent of average earning assets.\nThe net interest margin decreased four basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, totaling 3.21% for the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to increased\ncosts of interest-bearing deposits which resulted from the higher interest rate environment.\nNote 4 – Mortgage Banking\nTrustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that\noffsets the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) attributable to interest rates. These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not\notherwise qualify for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Changes in the fair value of these exchange-traded derivative instruments,\nincluding administrative costs, are recorded in noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the MSR. The MSR fair\nvalue represents the present value of future cash flows, which among other things includes decay and the effect of changes in interest rates. Ineffectiveness of hedging\nthe MSR fair value is measured by comparing the change in value of hedge instruments to the change in the fair value of the MSR asset attributable to changes in interest\nrates and other market driven changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. The impact of this strategy resulted in a net negative hedge ineffectiveness of $1.1 million\nduring the first quarter of 2024.\nThe following table illustrates the components of mortgage banking revenues included in noninterest income in the accompanying income statements:\nQuarter Ended\n3/31/2024 12/31/2023 9/30/2023 6/30/2023 3/31/2023\nMortgage servicing income, net $ 6,934 $ 6,731 $ 6,916 $ 6,764 $ 6,785\nChange in fair value-MSR from runoff (1,926) (2,972) (3,203) (2,710) (1,145)\nGain on sales of loans, net 5,009 3,913 3,748 3,887 3,797\nMortgage banking income before hedge\nineffectiveness 10,017 7,672 7,461 7,941 9,437\nChange in fair value-MSR from market changes 5,123 (10,224) 6,809 5,898 (3,972)\nChange in fair value of derivatives (6,225) 8,071 (7,812) (7,239) 2,174\nNet positive (negative) hedge ineffectiveness (1,102) (2,153) (1,003) (1,341) (1,798)\nMortgage banking, net $ 8,915 $ 5,519 $ 6,458 $ 6,600 $ 7,639\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS\nMarch 31, 2024\n($ in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nNote 5 – Other Noninterest Income and Expense\nOther noninterest income consisted of the following for the periods presented:\nQuarter Ended\n3/31/2024 12/31/2023 9/30/2023 6/30/2023 3/31/2023\nPartnership amortization for tax credit purposes $ (1,834) $ (2,013) $ (1,995) $ (2,019) $ (1,961)\nIncrease in life insurance cash surrender value 1,844 1,825 1,784 1,716 1,693\nOther miscellaneous income 3,622 2,767 2,610 3,998 2,782\nTotal other, net $ 3,632 $ 2,579 $ 2,399 $ 3,695 $ 2,514\nTrustmark invests in partnerships that provide income tax credits on a Federal and/or State basis (i.e., new market tax credits, low-income housing tax credits and historical\ntax credits).

Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Trustmark’s Common Equity\nTier 1 capital includes common stock, capital surplus and retained earnings, and is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated net deferred tax\nliabilities as well as disallowed deferred tax assets and threshold deductions as applicable.\nTrustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation\nof these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark’s capitalization to other organizations. These ratios differ from capital measures defined by\nbanking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders’ equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across\norganizations. In Management’s experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare\ncapital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting\nmethod in accounting for mergers and acquisitions.\nThese calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators. Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures,\nTrustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios. Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark,\nthere are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark’s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. Also, there may be limits in the\nusefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto\nin their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS\nMarch 31, 2024\n($ in thousands except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nNote 6 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures (continued)\nQuarter Ended\n3/31/2024 12/31/2023 9/30/2023 6/30/2023 3/31/2023\nTANGIBLE EQUITY\nAVERAGE BALANCES\nTotal shareholders' equity $ 1,676,521 $ 1,592,493 $ 1,582,885 $ 1,580,291 $ 1,523,828\nLess: Goodwill (384,237) (384,237) (384,237) (384,237) (384,237)\nIdentifiable intangible assets (2,920) (3,044) (3,174) (3,301) (3,523)\nTotal average tangible equity $ 1,289,364 $ 1,205,212 $ 1,195,474 $ 1,192,753 $ 1,136,068\nPERIOD END BALANCES\nTotal shareholders' equity $ 1,682,599 $ 1,661,847 $ 1,570,351 $ 1,571,193 $ 1,562,099\nLess: Goodwill (384,237) (384,237) (384,237) (384,237) (384,237)\nIdentifiable intangible assets (2,845) (2,965) (3,093) (3,222) (3,352)\nTotal tangible equity (a) $ 1,295,517 $ 1,274,645 $ 1,183,021 $ 1,183,734 $ 1,174,510\nTANGIBLE ASSETS\nTotal assets $18,376,612 $18,722,189 $18,390,839 $18,422,626 $18,877,178\nLess: Goodwill (384,237) (384,237) (384,237) (384,237) (384,237)\nIdentifiable intangible assets (2,845) (2,965) (3,093) (3,222) (3,352)\nTotal tangible assets (b) $17,989,530 $18,334,987 $18,003,509 $18,035,167 $18,489,589\nRisk-weighted assets (c) $15,257,385 $15,153,263 $15,143,531 $14,966,614 $14,793,893\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ADJUSTED FOR INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION\nNet income (loss) $ 41,535 $ 36,123 $ 34,029 $ 45,037 $ 50,300\nPlus: Intangible amortization net of tax 90 96 96 97 216\nNet income (loss) adjusted for intangible amortization $ 41,625 $ 36,219 $ 34,125 $ 45,134 $ 50,516\nPeriod end common shares outstanding (d) 61,178,366 61,071,173 61,070,095 61,069,036 61,048,516\nTANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY MEASUREMENTS\nReturn on average tangible equity (1) 12.98% 11.92% 11.32% 15.18% 18.03%\nTangible equity/tangible assets (a)/(b) 7.20% 6.95% 6.57% 6.56% 6.35%\nTangible equity/risk-weighted assets (a)/(c) 8.49% 8.41% 7.81% 7.91% 7.94%\nTangible book value (a)/(d)*1,000 $ 21.18 $ 20.87 $ 19.37 $ 19.38 $ 19.24\nCOMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL (CET1)\nTotal shareholders' equity $ 1,682,599 $ 1,661,847 $ 1,570,351 $ 1,571,193 $ 1,562,099\nCECL transition adjustment 6,500 13,000 13,000 13,000 13,000\nAOCI-related adjustments 227,154 219,723 287,888 265,704 242,381\nCET1 adjustments and deductions:\nGoodwill net of associated deferred\ntax liabilities (DTLs) (370,205) (370,212) (370,219) (370,227) (370,234)\nOther adjustments and deductions\nfor CET1 (2) (2,588) (2,693) (2,803) (2,915) (3,275)\nCET1 capital (e) 1,543,460 1,521,665 1,498,217 1,476,755 1,443,971\nAdditional tier 1 capital instruments\nplus related surplus 60,000 60,000 60,000 60,000 60,000\nTier 1 capital $ 1,603,460 $ 1,581,665 $ 1,558,217 $ 1,536,755 $ 1,503,971\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio (e)/(c) 10.12% 10.04% 9.89% 9.87% 9.76%\n(1) Calculation = ((net income (loss) adjusted for intangible amortization/number of days in period)*number of days in year)/total average tangible equity.\n(2) Includes other intangible assets, net of DTLs, disallowed deferred tax assets (DTAs), threshold deductions and transition adjustments, as applicable.\nTRUSTMARK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS\nMarch 31, 2024\n($ in thousands except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nNote 6 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures (continued)\nTrustmark discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures because Management uses these measures for business planning purposes, including to manage Trustmark’s\nbusiness against internal projected results of operations and to measure Trustmark’s performance.

They are a world-class agency that is committed to their culture, customers, communities, and associates, and we look forward to joining their team.” \n\nPeter Krause, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan Agency’s Southeast region, commented, “**FBBI** NSURANCE’s strong regional presence, client-focused approach, and terrific leadership were very attractive as we looked for a high-quality agency to expand our presence in the Southeast. I look forward to working with Scott and the entire **FBBI** NSURANCE team in delivering best-in-class solutions that address the growing risk management and benefit needs of businesses and individuals in the region.” \n\n**FBBI** NSURANCE anticipates that the transaction, which is subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approval, will close by the end of the second quarter of 2024.

You should be aware that the occurrence of the events described under the caption “Risk Factors” in Trustmark’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should any such underlying assumptions prove to be significantly different, actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated, estimated, projected or expected. \n\nRisks that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations of Management include, but are not limited to, actions by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) that impact the level of market interest rates, local, state, national and international economic and market conditions, conditions in the housing and real estate markets in the regions in which Trustmark operates and the extent and duration of the current volatility in the credit and financial markets, changes in the level of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, an increase in unemployment levels and slowdowns in economic growth, changes in our ability to measure the fair value of assets in our portfolio, material changes in the level and/or volatility of market interest rates, the impacts related to or resulting from bank failures and other economic and industry volatility, including potential increased regulatory requirements, the demand for the products and services we offer, potential unexpected adverse outcomes in pending litigation matters, our ability to attract and retain noninterest-bearing deposits and other low-cost funds, competition in loan and deposit pricing, as well as the entry of new competitors into our markets through de novo expansion and acquisitions, economic conditions, changes in accounting standards and practices, including changes in the interpretation of existing standards, that affect our consolidated financial statements, changes in consumer spending, borrowings and savings habits, technological changes, changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers, greater than expected costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquisitions or new products and lines of business, cyber-attacks and other breaches which could affect our information system security, natural disasters, environmental disasters, pandemics or other health crises, acts of war or terrorism, and other risks described in our filings with the SEC. \n\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as the result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240423522949r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Trustmark Investor Contacts:** Thomas C.
