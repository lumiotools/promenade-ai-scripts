These forward-looking statements are frequently identified by the use of forward-looking terminology,\nincluding the terms “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “plan,”\n“possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or other similar terms or expressions that\nrelate to our future performance, expectations, strategy, plans or intentions, and include statements in the section\ntitled “Financial Outlook” and statements regarding the use and impact of our IPO proceeds.\nOur actual results could differ materially from those stated in or implied by the forward-looking statements in this\npress release due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: the impact of our go-to-market transformation\nand ability to attract and retain customers, including increasingly larger customers and the continued growth of data\nstored by our customers; realizing the anticipated benefits relating to cost savings initiatives; market competition,\nincluding competitors that may have greater size, offerings and resources; effectively managing growth; ability to\noffer new features and other offerings on a timely basis, including geographic expansion, and achieve desired\nmarket adoption; disruption in our service or loss of availability of customers’ data; cyberattacks; continued growth\nconsistent with historical levels; the impact of pricing and other product offering changes; material defects or errors in\nour software; supply chain disruption; ability to maintain existing relationships with partners and to enter into new\npartnerships; ability to remediate and prevent material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting;\nhiring and retention of key employees; the impact of war or hostilities, and other significant world or regional events\non our business and the business of our customers, vendors, supply chain and partners; litigation and other\ndisputes; and general market, political, economic, and business conditions. Further information on these and\nadditional risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ\nmaterially from those included in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this release are included\nunder the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other filings and reports\nwe make with the SEC from time to time.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this release reflect our views as of the date of this press release. We\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this press release, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP), we use non-GAAP adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures exclude certain items and are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not\nnecessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We present these non-GAAP\nmeasures because management believes they are a useful measure of the company’s performance and provide an\nadditional basis for assessing our operating results. Please see the appendix attached to this press release for a\nreconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable\nGAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a\nforward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of,\nexpenses and other factors in the future. For example, stock-based compensation expense-related charges are\nimpacted by the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our\nfuture hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict with reasonable accuracy and subject to constant\nchange.\nAdjusted Gross Profit (and Margin)\nWe believe adjusted gross profit (and margin), when taken together with our GAAP financial results, provides a\nmeaningful assessment of our performance and is useful to us for evaluating our ongoing operations and for internal\nplanning and forecasting purposes.\nWe define adjusted gross margin as gross profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and\namortization within cost of revenue, as a percentage of adjusted gross profit to revenue. We exclude stock-based\ncompensation, which is a non-cash item, because we do not consider it indicative of our core operating performance.\nWe exclude depreciation expense of our property and equipment and amortization expense of capitalized\ninternal-use software because these may not reflect current or future cash spending levels to support our business.\nWe believe adjusted gross margin provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and\nfacilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this metric eliminates the effects of depreciation and\namortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based\ncompensation, interest expense, investment income, income tax provision, realized and unrealized gains and losses\non foreign currency transactions, impairment of long-lived assets, and other non-recurring charges. We use adjusted\nEBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that\nadjusted EBITDA, when taken together with our GAAP financial results, provides meaningful supplemental\ninformation regarding our operating performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our\nbusiness, results of operations, or outlook. We consider adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it\nhelps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent\nbasis.\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss)\nWe define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and other\nitems we deem non-recurring. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss), when taken together with our GAAP\nfinancial results, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance by excluding\ncertain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nWe define adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property\nand equipment, capitalized internal-use software costs, and principal payments on finance leases and lease\nfinancing obligations, as reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, and excluding other\nnonrecurring charges.\nKey Business Metrics:\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR)\nWe define annual recurring revenue (ARR) as the annualized value of all Backblaze B2 and Computer Backup\narrangements as of the end of a period. Given the renewable nature of our business, we view ARR as an important\nindicator of our financial performance and operating results, and we believe it is a useful metric for internal planning\nand analysis. ARR is calculated based on multiplying the monthly revenue from all Backblaze B2 and Computer\nBackup arrangements, which represent greater than 98% of our revenue for the periods presented (and excludes\nPhysical Media revenue), for the last month of a period by 12. Our annual recurring revenue for Computer Backup\nand B2 Cloud Storage is calculated in the same manner as our overall annual recurring revenue based on the\nrevenue from our Computer Backup and B2 Cloud Storage solutions, respectively.\nNet Revenue Retention Rate (NRR)\nOur overall net revenue retention rate (NRR) is a trailing four-quarter average of the recurring revenue from a cohort\nof customers in a quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year. We calculate our overall net revenue\nretention rate for a quarter by dividing (i) recurring revenue in the current quarter from any accounts that were active\nat the end of the same quarter of the prior year by (ii) recurring revenue in the current corresponding quarter from\nthose same accounts. Our overall net revenue retention rate includes any expansion of revenue from existing\ncustomers and is net of revenue contraction and customer attrition, and excludes revenue from new customers in the\ncurrent period. Our net revenue retention rate for Computer Backup and B2 Cloud Storage is calculated in the same\nmanner as our overall net revenue retention rate based on the revenue from our Computer Backup and B2 Cloud\nStorage solutions, respectively.\nGross Customer Retention Rate\nWe use gross customer retention rate to measure our ability to retain our customers. Our gross customer retention\nrate reflects only customer losses and does not reflect the expansion or contraction of revenue we earn from our\nexisting customers. We believe our high gross customer retention rates demonstrate that we serve a vital service to\nour customers, as the vast majority of our customers tend to continue to use our platform from one period to the\nnext. To calculate our gross customer retention rate, we take the trailing four-quarter average of the percentage of\ncohort of customers who were active at the end of the quarter in the prior year that are still active at the end of the\ncurrent quarter. We calculate our gross customer retention rate for a quarter by dividing (i) the number of accounts\nthat generated revenue in the last month of the current quarter that also generated recurring revenue during the last\nmonth of the corresponding quarter in the prior year, by (ii) the number of accounts that generated recurring revenue\nduring the last month of the corresponding quarter in the prior year.\nBACKBLAZE, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSeptember December\n30, 31,\n2024 2023\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,950 $ 12,502\nShort-term investments, net 17,931 16,799\nAccounts receivable, net 2,762 800\n8,254 8,413\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nTotal current assets 31,897 38,514\nRestricted cash, non-current 4,682 4,128\nProperty and equipment, net 41,532 45,600\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 15,729 9,980\nCapitalized internal-use software, net 41,037 32,521\n1,367 944\nOther assets\n$ 136,244 $ 131,687\nTotal assets\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 1,670 $ 1,973\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities(1) 7,016 8,768\nFinance lease liabilities and lease financing obligations, current 16,520 18,492\nOperating lease liabilities, current 3,853 1,878\n30,139 25,976\nDeferred revenue, current\nTotal current liabilities 59,198 57,087\nDebt facility, non-current 4,682 4,128\nDeferred revenue, non-current 5,210 4,073\nFinance lease liabilities and lease financing obligations, non-current 11,881 13,310\n12,442 8,151\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current\n$ 93,413 $ 86,749\nTotal liabilities\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ Equity\nClass A common stock, $0.0001 par value; 113,000,000 shares authorized as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; 44,265,173 and 39,150,610 shares issued\nand outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 4 4\nAdditional paid-in capital 224,435 192,388\n(181,608) (147,454)\nAccumulated deficit\n42,831 44,938\nTotal stockholders’ equity\n$ 136,244 $ 131,687\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity\n(1) As of September 30, 2024, the company reclassified certain current liabilities from accounts payable to accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities.

Our annual recurring\nrevenue for each of Computer Backup and B2 Cloud Storage is calculated in the same manner as our overall annual recurring\nrevenue based on the revenue from our Computer Backup and B2 Cloud Storage solutions, respectively.\n● “Gross Customer Retention” is used to measure our ability to retain our customers and is based on the trailing four-quarter\naverage of the percentage of cohort of customers who were active at the end of the quarter in the prior year that are still active\nat the end of the current quarter. We calculate our gross customer retention rate for a quarter by dividing (i) the number of\naccounts that generated revenue in the last month of the current quarter that also generated recurring revenue during the last\nmonth of the corresponding quarter in the prior year, by (ii) the number of accounts that generated recurring revenue during\nthe last month of the corresponding quarter in the prior year.\n● “NRR” means Net Revenue Retention and is based on a trailing four-quarter average of the recurring revenue from a cohort of\ncustomers in a quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year. Our net revenue retention rate for each of Computer\nBackup and B2 Cloud Storage is calculated in the same manner as our overall net revenue retention rate based on the revenue\nfrom our Computer Backup and B2 Cloud Storage solutions, respectively.\n● “Customer” means a customer at the end of any period as a distinct end user, as identified by a unique account identifier,\nwhich makes up substantially all of our user base.In Q4 2023, we refined our customer definition to include end-user customers\nthat purchase through a reseller. This resulted in no impact to previously reported metrics other than a 1% decrease to the 120%\nNRR metric reported for Q3 2023.\nBackblaze ©2024 | 17\nDefinitions\n● Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest\nexpense, investment income, income tax provision, realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions,\nimpairment of long-lived assets, and other non-recurring charges. We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and\nfor internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with our GAAP financial\nresults, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance by excluding certain items that may not\nbe indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. We consider adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it\nhelps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent\nbasis.\n● Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and\nequipment, capitalized internal-use software costs, and principal payments on finance leases and lease financing obligations, as\nreflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, and excluding other nonrecurring charges.\n● Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income adjusted to exclude stock-based\ncompensation and other items we deem non-recurring. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss), when taken together with\nour GAAP financial results, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance by excluding\ncertain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook.\n● Adjusted Gross Profit (and Margin) We define adjusted gross margin as gross profit, exclusive of stock-based compensation\nexpense, depreciation expense of our property and equipment, and amortization expense of capitalized internal-use software\nincluded within cost of revenue, as a percentage of adjusted gross profit to revenue. We exclude stock-based compensation,\nwhich is a non-cash item, because we do not consider it indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude depreciation\nexpense of our property and equipment and amortization expense of capitalized internal-use software, because these may not\nreflect current or future cash spending levels to support our business. We believe adjusted gross margin provides consistency\nand comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this metric\neliminates the effects of depreciation and amortization\nBackblaze ©2024 | 18\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: Gross Margin\nAdjusted Gross Profit Q3’24 Q3’23\nGross Profit $17.800 $11.753\nGross Margin 55% 46%\nAdjustments for Cost of Revenue:\nStock Based Compensation 0.478 0.653\nDepreciation and Amortization 7.191 6.336\nAdjusted Gross Profit $25.469 $18.742\nAdjusted Gross Margin 78% 74%\nDollars in Millions\nBackblaze ©2024 | 19\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: Net Income\nQ3’24 Q3’23\nNet Loss $(12.753) $(16.055)\nNet Loss Margin -39% -63%\nAdjustments:\nTotal Stock Based Compensation 8.438 7.958\nNon-recurring professional services — .282\nWorkforce reduction and related severance\n— 0.012\ncharges\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) $(4.315) $(7.803)\nNon-GAAP Net Income Margin -13% -31%\nNon-GAAP Diluted Shares 43.515 36.665\nNon-GAAP Net Loss per Diluted Share $(0.10) $(0.21)\nDollars and Shares in Millions\nBackblaze ©2024 | 20\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: Adjusted EBITDA\nQ3’24 Q3’23\nNet Loss $(12.753) $(16.055)\nNet Loss Margin -39% -63%\nAdjustments:\nTotal Depreciation & Amortization 7.331 6.473\nTotal Stock Based Compensation 8.438 7.958\nInterest expense and investment income 0.555 0.489\nNon-recurring professional services — .282\nForeign exchange loss (gain) 0.178 -.006\nWorkforce reduction and related severance\n— .012\ncharges\nAdjusted EBITDA $3.749 $(0.847)\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 12% -3%\nDollars in Millions\nBackblaze ©2024 | 21\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nQ3’24 Q3’23\nNet Cash Provided by (Used In)\n$4.629 ($0.170)\nOperating Activities\nCapital Expenditures (3.598) (4.310)\nPrincipal Payments on Finance\nLeases and Lease Financing (5.044) (5.144)\nObligations\nWorkforce Reduction and Related\n— 0.610\nSeverance Charges\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow ($4.013) ($9.014)\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Margin -12% -36%\nDollars in Millions\nBackblaze ©2024 | 22"

Our annual recurring\nrevenue for each of Computer Backup and B2 Cloud Storage is calculated in the same manner as our overall annual recurring\nrevenue based on the revenue from our Computer Backup and B2 Cloud Storage solutions, respectively.\n● “Gross Customer Retention” is used to measure our ability to retain our customers and is based on the trailing four-quarter\naverage of the percentage of cohort of customers who were active at the end of the quarter in the prior year that are still active\nat the end of the current quarter. We calculate our gross customer retention rate for a quarter by dividing (i) the number of\naccounts that generated revenue in the last month of the current quarter that also generated recurring revenue during the last\nmonth of the corresponding quarter in the prior year, by (ii) the number of accounts that generated recurring revenue during\nthe last month of the corresponding quarter in the prior year.\n● “NRR” means Net Revenue Retention and is based on a trailing four-quarter average of the recurring revenue from a cohort of\ncustomers in a quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year. Our net revenue retention rate for each of Computer\nBackup and B2 Cloud Storage is calculated in the same manner as our overall net revenue retention rate based on the revenue\nfrom our Computer Backup and B2 Cloud Storage solutions, respectively.\n● “Customer” means a customer at the end of any period as a distinct end user, as identified by a unique account identifier,\nwhich makes up substantially all of our user base.In Q4 2023, we refined our customer definition to include end-user customers\nthat purchase through a reseller. This resulted in no impact to previously reported metrics other than a 1% decrease to the 120%\nNRR metric reported for Q3 2023.\nBackblaze ©2024 | 17\nDefinitions\n● Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest\nexpense, investment income, income tax provision, realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions,\nimpairment of long-lived assets, and other non-recurring charges. We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and\nfor internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with our GAAP financial\nresults, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance by excluding certain items that may not\nbe indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. We consider adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it\nhelps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent\nbasis.\n● Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and\nequipment, capitalized internal-use software costs, and principal payments on finance leases and lease financing obligations, as\nreflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, and excluding other nonrecurring charges.\n● Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income adjusted to exclude stock-based\ncompensation and other items we deem non-recurring. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss), when taken together with\nour GAAP financial results, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance by excluding\ncertain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook.\n● Adjusted Gross Profit (and Margin) We define adjusted gross margin as gross profit, exclusive of stock-based compensation\nexpense, depreciation expense of our property and equipment, and amortization expense of capitalized internal-use software\nincluded within cost of revenue, as a percentage of adjusted gross profit to revenue. We exclude stock-based compensation,\nwhich is a non-cash item, because we do not consider it indicative of our core operating performance. We exclude depreciation\nexpense of our property and equipment and amortization expense of capitalized internal-use software, because these may not\nreflect current or future cash spending levels to support our business. We believe adjusted gross margin provides consistency\nand comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this metric\neliminates the effects of depreciation and amortization\nBackblaze ©2024 | 18\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: Gross Margin\nAdjusted Gross Profit Q3’24 Q3’23\nGross Profit $17.800 $11.753\nGross Margin 55% 46%\nAdjustments for Cost of Revenue:\nStock Based Compensation 0.478 0.653\nDepreciation and Amortization 7.191 6.336\nAdjusted Gross Profit $25.469 $18.742\nAdjusted Gross Margin 78% 74%\nDollars in Millions\nBackblaze ©2024 | 19\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: Net Income\nQ3’24 Q3’23\nNet Loss $(12.753) $(16.055)\nNet Loss Margin -39% -63%\nAdjustments:\nTotal Stock Based Compensation 8.438 7.958\nNon-recurring professional services — .282\nWorkforce reduction and related severance\n— 0.012\ncharges\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) $(4.315) $(7.803)\nNon-GAAP Net Income Margin -13% -31%\nNon-GAAP Diluted Shares 43.515 36.665\nNon-GAAP Net Loss per Diluted Share $(0.10) $(0.21)\nDollars and Shares in Millions\nBackblaze ©2024 | 20\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: Adjusted EBITDA\nQ3’24 Q3’23\nNet Loss $(12.753) $(16.055)\nNet Loss Margin -39% -63%\nAdjustments:\nTotal Depreciation & Amortization 7.331 6.473\nTotal Stock Based Compensation 8.438 7.958\nInterest expense and investment income 0.555 0.489\nNon-recurring professional services — .282\nForeign exchange loss (gain) 0.178 -.006\nWorkforce reduction and related severance\n— .012\ncharges\nAdjusted EBITDA $3.749 $(0.847)\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 12% -3%\nDollars in Millions\nBackblaze ©2024 | 21\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures: Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nQ3’24 Q3’23\nNet Cash Provided by (Used In)\n$4.629 ($0.170)\nOperating Activities\nCapital Expenditures (3.598) (4.310)\nPrincipal Payments on Finance\nLeases and Lease Financing (5.044) (5.144)\nObligations\nWorkforce Reduction and Related\n— 0.610\nSeverance Charges\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow ($4.013) ($9.014)\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Margin -12% -36%\nDollars in Millions\nBackblaze ©2024 | 22"
