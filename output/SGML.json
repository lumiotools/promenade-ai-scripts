During this month we achieved continuous production of over 850 tonnes per day of lithium oxide for several consecutive days, reaching peak days of 900 tonnes per day, demonstrating the enhanced production capabilities of the Greentech Industrial Plant. As a result, the annualized production run rate reached full capacity of 270,000 tonnes and the Company expects to maintain this annualized production level going forward.\n\n“ _Our ability to maintain a consistent monthly shipment cadence is a clear reflection of our operational excellence, and reliability as a mature producer. It also highlights the stability we have achieved in the use of our proprietary dense media separation technology to produce lithium oxide at our Greentech Industrial Plant,_ ” said Ana Cabral, CEO of Sigma Lithium. _“We are delighted with ongoing partnership with IRH in Abu Dhabi which enhances our commercial flexibility to effectively navigate lithium demand seasonality. This collaboration enables us to capitalize on every opportunity to maximize business performance and secure better lithium pricing, even in the current market environment. With Phase 1 now operating at full capacity, we are working relentlessly to replicate this industrial success as we move forward with the construction of our second Greentech Industrial Production Plant._“\n\n**ABOUT SIGMA LITHIUM** Sigma Lithium (TSXV/NASDAQ: SGML, BVMF: S2GM34) is a leading global lithium producer dedicated to powering the next generation of electric vehicle batteries with carbon-neutral, socially and environmentally sustainable chemical-grade lithium concentrate.\n\nSigma Lithium is one of the world’s largest lithium producers.

We also benefited from our shifted commercial strategy to navigate industry seasonality, enabling us to secure higher average realized prices compared to benchmarks._\n\n_“Over the last year we are proud to have transformed Sigma from an emerging producer into an industry leader, demonstrating the operational and financial resilience of a mature producer, with dependability and consistency. Meanwhile we have delivered on all of our climate goals, reaching Net Zero one year in advance of our target and 27 years ahead of the industry, with our Quintuple Zero Green Lithium. We are confident that over the lithium cycles, our capabilities to execute to strategy will deliver long-term value for Sigma and all of its stakeholders_ _“, Ms. Cabral concluded._\n\n**_Key Performance Metrics for Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 _**_(US$)_\n\n**Unit** |  **3Q24** |  **2Q24**  \n---|---|---  \nSales Revenue for Shipents in Quarter |  $ 000s |  44,210 |  54,418  \nProvisional Price Adjustment |  $ 000s |  (23,316) |  (8,498)  \nTotal Sales Revenue |  $ 000s |  20,894 |  45,920  \nConcentrate Sold |  tonnes |  57,483 |  52,572  \nConcentrate Grade Sold |  % |  5.2 % |  5.5 %  \nAverage Reported Selling Price CIF (1) |  $/t |  820 |  1,056  \nAverage Revenue per Tonne CIF (2) |  $/t |  415 |  894  \nUnit Operating Cost CIF (3) |  $/t |  513 |  515  \nCash and Cash Equivalents |  $ 000s |  65,594 |  75,330  \n  \nRevenues in the third quarter totaled US$44.2 million or US$20.9 million net of provisional price adjustments.\n\nThe Company has undergone a significant evolution in its commercial relationship with trading companies, strengthening commercial conditions. As a result of this change in strategy the Company concluded the final settlement of provisional sales invoices from previous quarters conducted through our traders, generating an accounting adjustment of US$(23.3) million. Importantly, these are primarily non-cash accounting closing settlements and do not have an effect on the future earnings potential of the Company.\n\nIn 3Q, Sigma Lithium maintained one of the lowest cash unit operating costs in the industry, with CIF China averaging US$ 513/t, down from US$ 515/t in 2Q24, in line with target levels. \n\n  * Cash unit operating costs(3) for lithium concentrate produced at the Company’s Grota do Cirilo operations in the third quarter averaged US$ 395/t (including a temporary US$25/t for mobile crushers).\n  * On an FOB Vitoria(3) basis (which includes transportation and port charges) costs averaged US$449/t.\n  * On a CIF China basis(3) (includes ocean freight, insurance and royalties) costs averaged US$513/t.\n\n\n\nRobust operating cash flow generation of US$ 34 million in the third quarter enabled the Company to maintain a healthy cash position of US$ 66 million, ultimately reflecting the non-cash nature of the accounting adjustments to the quarter.\n\n  * The Company delivered third quarter cash adjusted EBITDA(4) of US$(10.6) million. Reported EBITDA for the third quarter totaled US$(12.8) million.\n  * The cash adjusted EBITDA number excludes US$0.8 million of non-recurring expenditures, primarily related to capital markets and cost initiatives, and US$1.4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\n\n\nNet income in the quarter totaled US$(25.1) million or US$(0.23) per diluted share outstanding. These reported results were affected by the aforementioned US$(23.3) million in accounting adjustments.\n\n**Operational Update**\n\nSigma Lithium achieved strong operational performance at its Greentech industrial plant in the third quarter. Production of Sigma Lithium’s Quintuple Zero Lithium Concentrate totaled 60,237t, up 22% from 2Q24 and ahead of the 60,000t guidance. This includes numerous daily production records and periods of sustained operations above 860t per day. The Company expects 4Q24 production of lithium concentrate to reach at least 60,000 tonne.\n\n**Commercial Strategy Update**\n\nSigma Lithium sold 57,483 tonnes of its Quintuple Zero Green Lithium concentrate in the third quarter, when its operational performance enabled it to further increase shipping cadence to quasi monthly volumes sold of 22,000t. As a result, the Company made two full 22,000t shipments during the quarter and supplemented these volumes with 13,483t sold at the Port customs warehouse.\n\nOperational reliability and a consistent shipment pattern lowered the Company’s export credit risk, increasing the availability and lowering the interest rate of its trade finance lines. This generated direct benefits for Sigma’s commercial strategy, enabling the Company to further geographically diversify its accounts receivables, shipping to three distributors across the world: Glencore AG (Europe), Mitsubishi Corporation RtM International Pte. Ltd (Japan/ Singapore), and International Resources Holdings (UAE/Abu Dhabi).\n\nThe interest rate cost of the Company’s trade finance export credit lines decreased substantially over the year from nearly 15.5% in 4Q23 to 9.0% in 3Q24. In parallel, the amount of available export trade lines exceeded US$ 100 million in the year.\n\nThe increased financial flexibility enabled the Company to strengthen its commercial strategy and change its distribution relationship with trading companies from “traders as principals” to “traders as distributors”. This strategy shift allows Sigma to capitalize on annual restocking trends of chemical refiners, weather seasonality more effectively and outperform market price benchmarks, achieving average CIF sales price for the third quarter of US$ 820/t.\n\nWhile Sigma Lithium ships and sells monthly to its trading partners, its goal is to build maximum flexibility in the final re-sale to clients to benefit from the established seasonality of refiners’ restocking periods. When combined with its superior metallurgical properties and the associated value-in-use driven cost savings to customers, Sigma believes it has positioned itself to drive superior price realizations over time.\n\nThis commercial strategy of “trader as a distributor” was not yet in place __during Company’s second through seventh shipments,__ when trading partners served as the principals to the transaction. The accounting provisional price adjustment booked in this quarter was mainly a result of the booking of final invoice settlement and closing of these trades.\n\n**Phase 2 Expansion**\n\nRecall, on April 1, 2024, the Board of Directors announced a Final Investment Decision for the Company’s Phase 2 Greentech Plant expansion. The project is expected to add 250,000 tonnes of production capacity to the current Phase 1 operation. Importantly, the Company has already received all relevant licenses to build and operate this second Greentech Plant. \n\nIn 3Q, Sigma Lithium initiated earthworks by completing clearing of the terrain for arid and semi-arid vegetation suppression (including fauna capture and classification) for the entire industrial project, including future phase 3 construction of production plant. Total building and commissioning are expected to occur over a 12-month period, with budgeted capex for Phase 2 of BRL492 million (approximately US$90mm at current exchange rates).\n\nOn August 29, the National Brazilian Bank for Economic and Social Development (**BNDES**) delivered a binding commitment to Sigma for a BRL 487mm development loan to finance this expansion.\n\nOn October 10, Sigma and the BNDES signed the final binding loan agreement, concluding the closing of the loan package**.** The first disbursement of the development loan is pending the Company posting bank guarantees with BNDES. This disbursement shall reimburse the capex already disbursed by the Company since first approval of the development bank loan.\n\nThe key terms and conditions of the development loan are:\n\n  * Amount: BRL 487 million\n  * Term: 192 months (16 years)\n  * Interest Rate: BRL 7.53% per year (US$ at approximately 2.5% at prevailing swap rates).\n  * Amortization Grace Period: 18 months – Calendarized Amortization: 174 months\n  * Assets in Collateral: Not required. Development Loan shall be secured by letter of credit (“fianca bancaria”) issued by a BNDES registered financial institution.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet & Liquidity **\n\nRobust operating cash flow generation of US$ 34 million during the third quarter enabled the Company to maintain a healthy cash position. Sigma Lithium ended the third quarter with US$65.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFree cash flow in the quarter totaled US$32 million primarily related to a reduction in working capital associated with the collection of accounts receivable.\n\nCash generation in the third quarter enabled the Company to repay certain export credit debt, reducing outstanding trade line balances. At the end of the quarter, the Company had US$181 million in short-term and long-term debt. This included US$59 million in drawn and available, but unutilized, additional liquidity through trade finance lines.\n\nCapital expenditures during the third quarter totaled US$2.5 million (C$3.1 million) directed towards maintenance, mining, Phase 2 expansion work, and incremental investments in the Greentech Plant. \n\n**ABOUT SIGMA LITHIUM**\n\nSigma Lithium (NASDAQ: SGML, TSXV: SGML, BVMF: S2GM34) is a leading global lithium producer dedicated to powering the next generation of electric vehicle batteries with carbon neutral, socially and environmentally sustainable chemical-grade lithium concentrate.\n\nSigma Lithium is one of the world’s largest lithium producers.

All statements that address future plans, activities, events, estimates, expectations or developments that the Company believes, expects or anticipates will or may occur is forward-looking information, including statements regarding the potential development of mineral resources and mineral reserves which may or may not occur. Forward-looking information contained herein is based on certain assumptions regarding, among other things: general economic and political conditions; the stable and supportive legislative, regulatory and community environment in Brazil; demand for lithium, including that such demand is supported by growth in the electric vehicle market; the Company’s market position and future financial and operating performance; the Company’s estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves, including whether mineral resources will ever be developed into mineral reserves; and the Company’s ability to operate its mineral projects including that the Company will not experience any materials or equipment shortages, any labour or service provider outages or delays or any technical issues. Although management believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that these assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking information inherently involves and is subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to that the market prices for lithium may not remain at current levels; and the market for electric vehicles and other large format batteries currently has limited market share and no assurances can be given for the rate at which this market will develop, if at all, which could affect the success of the Company and its ability to develop lithium operations. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

These non-IFRS financial measures are a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to, the Company’s results presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures presented by the Company may be different from non-GAAP/IFRS financial measures presented by other companies. Specifically, the Company believes the non-IFRS information provides useful measures to investors regarding the Company’s financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-U.S. GAAP/IFRS financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP/IFRS. A reconciliation of these financial measures to IFRS results is included herein._\n\n_1: Average selling price, CIF represents revenues associated with shipments invoiced during the reporting period netted out against total volume shipped.__The final price may be higher or lower than the invoiced price based on future price movements._\n\n_2: Reported revenue per tonne, CIF equivalent reflects net revenues for the quarter and tonnes shipped. Given a change in accounting policy in 3Q, the Company is not realizing the ocean freight and insurance costs associated with its 3Q shipments until product has been received by the final customer. Thus, this exercise is grossing up the reported revenues for these costs to create a more peer and market comparable figure.__The final price may be higher or lower than the estimated realized price based on future price movements._\n\n**Revenue Bridge – Unaudited** |  **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \n_$000 USD_  \n**3Q24 Invoiced Revenues – CIF** |  $44,550  \nProvisional price adjustment for shipments: 3Q24 |  2,607  \n**3Q24 Revenues – CIF** |  **$47,157**  \nAdjustment for CIF Accounting |  (2,947)  \n**3Q24 Revenues – FOB** |  **$44,210**  \nProvisional price adjustment for shipments: 1Q24 – 2Q24 |  (15,611)  \nProvisional price adjustment for shipments: 3Q23 – 4Q23 |  (7,705)  \n**Reported Revenues – FOB** |  **$20,894**  \nAdjustment for CIF Accounting |  2,947  \n**Reported Revenues – CIF** |  **23,841**  \nLithium Concentrate Sales Volumes |  57,483  \n_$ / tonne_  \n**3Q24 Invoiced Price – CIF** |  $775  \nProvisional price adjustment for shipments: 3Q24 |  45  \n**3Q24 Price – CIF** |  **$820**  \nAdjustment for CIF Accounting |  (51)  \n**3Q24 Price – FOB** |  **$769**  \n  \n_3. Cash u_ _nit operating costs include mining, processing, and site based general and administration costs. It is calculated on an incurred basis, credits for any capitalised mine waste development costs, and it excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization of mine and processing associated activities. When reported on an FOB basis, this metric includes road freight, and port related charges. When reported on a CIF basis it includes ocean freight, insurance and royalty costs. Royalty costs include a 2% government royalty and a 1% private royalty._\n\n_For CIF production cost analysis purposes, Sigma is considering the ocean freight costs of product that sailed in the month of reporting. However, for accounting purposes, and thus in this quarter’s reported cost of good sold and revenues, the ocean freight cost is to be recognized the moment material is delivered to the customer. Overtime, this will even out as a consistent pattern of boats are shipped and delivered, but as it is a newly adopted accounting policy, it is translating to a lower reported dollar revenue and cost for 3Q24 than what is implied by our CIF production and revenue accounting above._\n\n_4. Adjusted Cash EBITDA is a measure of recurring core earnings profile of the company. It is calculated as revenues minus cash operating and selling expenses. The calculation excludes non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expenses as well as certain non-recurring cash expenses such as legal expenses associated with capital markets or strategic initiatives._\n\n**_Adjusted Cash EBITDA Bridge_**\n\n**EBITDA Bridge – Unaudited** |  **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024** |  **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n---|---|---  \n_**($ 000)**_ |  **CAD** |  **USD**  \nSales Revenues |  59,887 |  44,210  \nProvisional price adjustments |  (31,612) |  (23,316)  \n**Revenues** |  **28,275** |  **20,894**  \nCost of goods sold & distribution |  (39,733) |  (29,232)  \n**Gross Profit** |  **(11,458)** |  **(8,338)**  \nSales expenses |  (535) |  (392)  \nG&A expense |  (7,163) |  (5,252)  \nStock-based compensation |  (1,871) |  (1,369)  \nESG & other operating expenses, net |  (416) |  (304)  \n**EBIT** |  **(21,444)** |  **(15,655)**  \nDepreciation & Amortization |  3,912 |  2,876  \n**EBITDA** |  **(17,532)** |  **(12,779)**  \n**_EBITDA (%)_** |  _**-62 %**_ |  _**-61 %**_  \nNon-recurring expenses (1) |  1,089 |  798  \nStock-based compensation |  1,871 |  1,369  \n**Adjusted Cash EBITDA** |  **(14,571)** |  **(10,612)**  \n**_Adjusted EBITDA (%)_** |  _**-52 %**_ |  _**-51 %**_  \n  \n(_1)_ |  _Non-recurring expenses include certain legal and advisory costs and severance costs associated with ongoing productivity initiatives._  \n---|---  \n  \n[ ![Plant 2 Construction at Grota do Cirilo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2558921/ground_clearing_1.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2558921/ground_clearing_1.html)\n\n[ ![Sigma Lithium Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Sigma Lithium Corporation\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1702124/Sigma_Lithium_Logo2.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1702124/Sigma_Lithium_Logo2.html)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=DE58067&sd=2024-11-15) View original content to download multimedia:[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sigma-lithium-announces-3q24-results-production-beats-guidance-maintained-low-costs-at-target-generated-robust–34-million-operating-cash-flow-302306928.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sigma-lithium-announces-3q24-results-production-beats-guidance-maintained-low-costs-at-target-generated-robust--34-million-operating-cash-flow-302306928.html)\n\nSOURCE Sigma Lithium Corporation\n\n## Contact us\n\n[ Send us a message ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/contact-us/)\n\nSign up for our newsletter:\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nCompany\n\nEmail*\n\nPress Releases\n\nAll SEC Filings\n\nUnsubscribe from all email communications.\n\nSign up for our newsletter:\n\nName \n\nE-mail \n\nSend\n\n[ ![](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/logo-SigmaBranco-footer.svg) ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com)\n\nSigma Lithium (NASDAQ: SGML, TSXV: SGML) is a company dedicated to powering the next generation of electric vehicle batteries with environmentally sustainable and high-purity lithium. \n\nRegistered Office\n\nSuite 2200, HSBC Building, 885 West Georgia St.Vancouver, BC, V6C 3E8, Canada\n\nContact\n\n+55 11 2985 0089contact@sigmalithium.com.br\n\n[Corporate](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/about-us/)\n\n  * [ About us ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/about-us/)\n  * [ Board of Directors ](/about-us/#board-directors)\n  * [ Management ](/about-us/#management)\n\n\n\n[Grota do Cirilo](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/?page_id=5356)\n\n  * [ Project Summary ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/?page_id=5356)\n  * [ Timeline ](/grota-do-cirilo/#timeline)\n  * [ Project Details ](/grota-do-cirilo/#project-details)\n  * [ Reserves and Resources ](/grota-do-cirilo/#reserves-esources)\n\n\n\n[Sustainability](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/sustainability/)\n\n  * [ ESG Approach ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/sustainability/)\n  * [ Environment ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/environmental/)\n  * [ Social ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/social/)\n  * [ Governance ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/governance/)\n  * [ Sustainable Lithium ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/sustainable-lithium/)\n  * [ ESG Reports ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/esg-reports/)\n  * [ Media Gallery ](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/media-gallery/)\n\n\n\n[Investors](https://ir.sigmalithiumresources.com/)\n\n[Contact us](https://sigmalithiumresources.com/contact-us/)\n\nCopyright 2023 Sigma Lithium \n\nPrivacy Policy \n\n[ Linkedin ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sigma-lithium-resources/) [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/SigmaLithium) [ Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/sigmalithium/) [ Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/@sigmalithiumresources9649)\n"

When\nalternative accounting methods exist, management has chosen those it deems most appropriate\nin the circumstances. Financial statements are not exact, as they include certain amounts based\non estimates and judgments. Management has determined such amounts on a reasonable basis\nto ensure that the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects.\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial\nreporting and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the financial statements. The\nBoard carries out this responsibility principally through its Audit, Finance and Risk Committee.\nThe Audit, Finance and Risk Committee is appointed by the Board, and all of its members are\nindependent directors. The Audit, Finance and Risk Committee meets at least four times a year\nwith management and the external auditors to discuss internal controls over the financial reporting\nprocess, auditing matters, and financial reporting issues to satisfy itself that each party is properly\ndischarging its responsibilities. It also reviews the quarterly and annual reports, the unaudited\ninterim consolidated financial statements, and the external auditor’s reports. The Audit, Finance\nand Risk Committee reports its findings to the Board for consideration when approving the\nunaudited interim consolidated financial statements for issuance to the shareholders. The Audit,\nFinance and Risk Committee also considers, for review by the Board and approval by the\nshareholders, the engagement or reappointment of the external auditors.\n\"Ana Cabral Gardner\"\nChief Executive Officer and Co-Chairperson\n\"Rogério Marchini Santos\"\nChief Financial Officer\n- 2 -\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nUnaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars)\nNotice of Non-Review of Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nIn accordance with National Instrument 51-102 Part 4, subsection 4.3(3)(a), if an auditor has not\nperformed a review of these consolidated interim financial statements, they must be accompanied\nby a notice indicating that these consolidated interim financial statements have not been reviewed\nby an auditor.\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have\nbeen prepared by and are the responsibility of the Company's management.\nThe Company’s independent auditor has not performed a review of these unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements for the three-month period and for the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, in accordance with standards established by the Canadian Institute of\nChartered Accountants for a review of interim financial statements by the entity’s auditor.\n- 3 -\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nUnaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars)\nNotes 9/30/2024 12/31/2023\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents 5 88,645 64,403\nTrade accounts receivable 6 20,109 29,693\nInventories 7 22,394 19,442\nAdvance to suppliers 8 11,323 7,062\nAccounts receivable from related parties 13 12 14\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 2,532 4,380\nRecoverable VAT and other taxes 9 11,029 17,682\nTotal current assets 156,044 142,676\nNon-current assets\nLoan and accounts receivable from related parties 13 16,760 13,160\nPrepaid expenses and other assets -

Corporate information\nSigma Lithium Corporation (the “Company” or “Sigma Lithium” or “Sigma”), together with its direct and\nindirect subsidiaries, is a commercial producer of lithium concentrate.\nThese unaudited consolidated financial statements include the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Sigma\nLithium Holdings Inc. (“Sigma Holdings”), which is domiciled in Canada and incorporated under the\nBusiness Corporations Act (British Columbia), and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries incorporated in\nBrazil, Sigma Mineração S.A. (“Sigma Brazil”) and Sigma Industrial de Lítio S.A (“Sigma Industrial”).\nSigma Brazil holds a 100% interest in four mineral properties: Grota do Cirilo, São Jose, Santa Clara, and\nGenipapo, located in the municipalities of Araçuaí and Itinga, in the Vale do Jequitinhonha region (referred\nas thereafter as “Jequitinhonha Valley”) in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil (together, the “Lithium\nProperties”), where our operating assets are located.\nThe Company’s common shares commenced trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”) on May\n9, 2018, under the symbol “SGML” (formerly “SGMA”) and on September 13, 2021 on Nasdaq Capital\nMarket (“Nasdaq”), the symbol was unified to “SGML”. On July 24, 2023, Sigma Lithium began trading its\nunsponsored Brazilian Depositary Receipts (“BDR’s”) on B3, the Brazilian Stock Exchange. Unsponsored\nBDRs are issued by depository institutions without the participation of the foreign companies that issued\nthe backing securities, being classified only as Level I Unsponsored BDRs.\n2. Basis of preparation\nThe Company prepares its unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards\nBoard (“IASB”) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).\nThe unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared and are presented in\naccordance with IAS 34 - “Interim Financial Reporting”.\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost\nmethod, except for certain financial instruments measured at fair value.\nSignificant accounting judgments and estimates used by management in the preparation of unaudited\ninterim consolidated financial statements are presented in Note 3.\nAll the amounts presented in $ have been translated from the Company's functional currency and may\ncontain immaterial rounding.\nThe unaudited interim consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on\nNovember 14, 2024.\n2.1. Subsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed\nto, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those\nreturns through its power over the entity. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of\nsubsidiaries are included in the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements from the date on which\ncontrol commences until the date on which control ceases.\n2.2. Transactions eliminated on consolidation\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group\ntransactions, are eliminated.\n-9-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\n2.3. Functional currency\nThe Company's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it\noperates and that best reflects its business and operations. The Company’s operations are held by the\nBrazilian subsidiary, Sigma Mineração S.A., which provides the entirety of the inflows and outflows of the\nCompany, including any dividends to be remitted. The Parent Company in Canada is a pure holding with\nno operations and depends on the Brazilian subsidiary to provide its cash flow. The prices of the lithium\ncommodity are globally referenced in U.S. dollars to provide reference to the market players located in\ndifferent countries and different currencies. Consequently, the Company’s revenues are translated into the\nBrazilian Real, which is the currency that most of the costs for supplying products or services are incurred\nand which the costs are normally expressed and settled. Accordingly, the Company’s functional currency\nis the Brazilian Real (\"R$\").\n2.4. Presentation currency of the financial statements\nThe presentation currency is the currency in which the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements\nare presented and is usually defined according to the Company's legal obligations and the currency where\nthe reporting entity is located. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are presented in\nCanadian Dollars (“$” or “CAD$”), translating the statements prepared in the functional currency of the\nBrazilian subsidiaries into Canadian Dollars, using the following criteria:\n• Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position date presented are translated at the\nclosing rate at the date of that statement of financial position;\n• Income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss are translated at the average monthly\nexchange rates for each month;\n• Shareholders' equity at historical cost, and\n• All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive loss.\n2.5. Material accounting policies\nAs to the recognition and measurement basis applied in the preparation of the financial statements, the\nmaterial accounting practices are presented in each of the Notes to which they refer.\n3. Use of judgments and estimates\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments throughout and\nestimates about the future that affect the application of the Company’s accounting policies and the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nJudgments\nJudgments have been made in applying accounting policies that have significant effects on the amounts\nrecognized in the financial statements when preparing these financial statements. The judgement\nconsidered in these financial statements is the classification as non-current liability of the long-term export\nprepayment agreement repayable by December 2026 since the amortization of principal is dependent upon\nthe sum of net cash from operating and investing activities.\nEstimates\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are consistent with the\nCompany’s risk management and commitments where appropriate. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\n-10-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nThe areas which require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions in\ndetermining carrying amounts, as follows:\nNote 6 and 24 – Provisional pricing adjustments: The Company’s products may be provisionally priced\nat the date revenue is recognized and a provisional invoice issued. Provisionally priced receivables are\nsubsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”. The final\nselling price for all provisionally priced products is based on the estimated price for the quotational period\nstipulated in the contracts. The change in value of the provisionally priced receivable is based on relevant\nforward market prices and is included in sales revenue. For contracts with variable pricing dependent on\nthe content of mineral in the product delivered, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to\nwhich it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the products.\nNote 11 - Mineral reserves and mineral resources: Proven and probable mineral reserves of the\nCompany are those measured and indicated mineral resources demonstrated by at least a preliminary\nfeasibility study and commercial viability. The Company estimates its proven and probable mineral reserves\nand measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources based on the work done and compiled by qualified\npersons. The estimation of future cash flows related to proven and probable mineral reserves is based upon\nfactors such as estimates of commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and\nproduction costs along with geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade\nof the mineral ore body. Changes in the proven and probable mineral reserves or measured, indicated and\ninferred mineral resources estimates may impact the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment,\nasset retirement obligations, recognition of deferred tax amounts and depreciation and depletion.\nNote 11 – Impairment of non-financial assets: Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions are\nrequired to determine whether an impairment trigger event has occurred and to prepare the Company’s\ncash flows. Management uses the budgets approved as a starting point and key assumptions are, but not\nlimited to: (i) mineral reserves and mineral resources measured by internal experts; (ii) costs and\ninvestments based on the best estimate of projects; (iii) sale prices consistent with projections available in\nreports published by industry considering the market price when appropriate; (iv) the useful life of the\nCompany’s cash generating unit; and (v) discount rates that reflect specific risks relating to the relevant\nassets in the cash-generating unit. These assumptions are susceptible to risks and uncertainties and may\nchange the Company’s projection and, therefore, may affect the recoverable value of assets.\nNote 20 - Assets retirement obligation: The Company assesses its provision for assets retirement\nobligation on an annual basis or when new material information becomes available. Mining and exploration\nactivities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. In\ngeneral, these laws and regulations are continually changing, and the Company has made, and intends to\nmake in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Accounting for restoration,\nrehabilitation, and environmental remediation obligations requires management to make estimates of the\nfuture costs the Company will incur to complete the restoration, rehabilitation, and environmental\nremediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations at each mining operation. Actual\ncosts incurred may differ from those amounts estimated. Also, future changes to environmental laws and\nregulations could increase the extent of restoration, rehabilitation, and environmental remediation work\nrequired to be performed by the Company. Increase in future costs could materially impact the amounts\ncharged to operations for restoration, rehabilitation, and environmental remediation. The provision\nrepresents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future restoration, rehabilitation, and\nenvironmental remediation obligation. The actual future expenditures may differ from the amounts currently\nprovided.\nNote 28 - Measurement of share-based payment transactions: The valuation of the Company’s share-\nbased payment transactions requires the use of estimates and valuation techniques. Measurement of the\nCompany’s restricted share units (“RSU’s”) that contain market-based conditions is based on a Monte Carlo\npricing model which uses various inputs and assumptions. Changes in these assumptions result in changes\nin the fair value of these instruments and a corresponding change in the amount recognized in profit or\n-11-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nloss. Judgement is also required in determining grant date and in estimating when non-market performance\nconditions are expected to be met.\n4. New accounting standards and interpretations\n4.1. Effective as from January 1st, 2024\n• Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to IAS 1 Non-current\nLiabilities with Covenants – Amendments to IAS 1\nAmendments made to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements in 2020 and 2022 clarified that\nliabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the end\nof the reporting year. Classification is unaffected by the entity’s expectations or events after the\nreporting date (e.g. the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant).\nCovenants of loan arrangements will not affect classification of a liability as current or non-current at\nthe reporting date if the entity must only comply with the covenants after the reporting date. However,\nif the entity must comply with a covenant either before or at the reporting date, this will affect the\nclassification as current or non-current even if the covenant is only tested for compliance after the\nreporting date.\nThe amendments require disclosures if an entity classifies a liability as non-current and that liability is\nsubject to covenants that the entity must comply with within 12 months of the reporting date. The\ndisclosures include:\n• the carrying amount of the liability,\n• information about the covenants, and\n• facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate that the entity may have difficulty complying with the\ncovenants.\n• The amendments also clarify what IAS 1 means when it refers to the ‘settlement’ of a liability.\nTerms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the\ntransfer of the entity’s own equity instrument can only be ignored for the purpose of classifying\nthe liability as current or non-current if the entity classifies the option as an equity instrument.\nHowever, conversion options that are classified as a liability must be considered when\ndetermining the current/non-current classification of a convertible note. The amendments must\nbe applied retrospectively in accordance with the normal requirements in IAS 8 Accounting\nPolicies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Special transitional rules apply if an entity\nhad early adopted the 2020 amendments regarding the classification of liabilities as current or\nnon-current. There were no financial effects of adoption of this Standard.\n• Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback – Amendments to IFRS 16\nIn September 2022, the IASB finalized narrow-scope amendments to the requirements for sale and\nleaseback transactions in IFRS 16 Leases which explain how an entity accounts for a sale and\nleaseback after the date of the transaction.\nThe amendments specify that, in measuring the lease liability subsequent to the sale and leaseback,\nthe seller-lessee determines ‘lease payments’ and ‘revised lease payments’ in a way that does not\nresult in the seller-lessee recognizing any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right-of-use\nthat it retains. This could particularly impact sale and leaseback transactions where the lease\npayments include variable payments that do not depend on an index or a rate. There were no financial\neffects of adoption of this Standard.\n-12-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\n• Supplier finance arrangements – Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7\nThe IASB has issued new disclosure requirements about supplier financing arrangements (‘SFAs’),\nafter feedback to an IFRS Interpretations Committee agenda decision highlighted that the information\nrequired by IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures falls short\nof meeting user information needs.\nThe objective of the new disclosures is to provide information about SFAs that enables investors to\nassess the effects on an entity’s liabilities, cash flows and the exposure to liquidity risk. The new\ndisclosures include information about the following:\nThe terms and conditions of SFAs.\na) The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are part of SFAs and the line items in which those\nliabilities are presented.\nb) The carrying amount of the financial liabilities in (b) for which suppliers have already received payment\nfrom the finance providers.\nc) The range of payment due dates for both the financial liabilities that are part of SFAs, and comparable\ntrade payables that are not part of such arrangements.\nd) Non-cash changes in the carrying amounts of financial liabilities in(b).\ne) Access to SFA facilities and concentration of liquidity risk with finance providers.\nThe IASB has provided transitional relief by not requiring comparative information in the first year, and\nalso not requiring disclosure of specified opening balances. Further, the required disclosures are only\napplicable for annual periods during the first year of application. Therefore, the earliest that the new\ndisclosures will have to be provided is in annual financial reports for December 2024 year-ends, unless\nan entity has a financial year of less than 12 months. There were no financial effects of adoption of\nthis Standard.\n4.2. Standards issued in 2024\n• Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements – IFRS 18\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued new requirements for the\npresentation and disclosure of information in general purpose financial statements to ensure they\nprovide relevant and faithful representations of an entity's assets, liabilities, equity, income, and\nexpenses. The objective is to offer financial information that helps users assess the prospects for\nfuture net cash inflows and evaluate management’s stewardship of the entity’s economic resources.\nThese financial statements comply with IFRS Accounting Standards, adhering to both general and\nspecific requirements for presenting information in the statement of financial performance, the\nstatement of financial position, and the statement of changes in equity. The requirements include\naggregation and disaggregation of information to ensure clarity, a comprehensive statement of profit\nor loss, and the presentation of totals and subtotals for key financial metrics. This standard, issued in\nApril 2024, is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027.\n5. Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include the following:\n9/30/2024 12/31/2023\nCash 87,816 52,888\nShort-term investments 829 11,515\n88,645 64,403\n-13-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nIn 2024 short-term investments refer to fixed income investments indexed to 91.4% p.a. of the Brazilian\ninterbank deposit certificate (CDI) with immediate liquidity (94.78% p.a on December 31,2023). Additionally,\nthe Company has short-term investments in Canada (denominated in United States Dollars) with an\napproximate yield of 5% p.a. on September 30, 2024, and 5.5% p.a. December 31, 2023.\nAccounting policy\nCash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash in banks and\non hand, and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are readily\nconvertible into a known amount of cash. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are\ntranslated at the dates prevailing on each date the transactions occur, and the cash balances are translated\nat the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Any translation differences are\nrecognized in other comprehensive loss.\n6. Trade accounts receivable\n9/30/2024 12/31/2023\nAccounts receivable with customers 16,753 95,922\nPrice adjustment 3,356 (66,229)\n20,109 29,693\nThe Company's operations include accounts receivable where the final selling price is established days\nafter initial revenue recognition and product delivery.\nThe trade accounts receivable is subject to significant market price changes until the final selling price is\nsettled. The Company monitors the futures market for lithium to estimate the final prices when the\nquotational periods of the contracts close. As a result, accounts receivable on September 30, 2024, have\nbeen estimated and adjusted to the relevant forward market prices (see Note 24). Any fluctuations in the\nvalue of these receivables are reflected in the Company's sales revenue.\nAccounting policy\nTrade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold performed in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Trade receivables are recognized initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional,\nunless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognized at fair value.\nTrade receivables include provisionally priced invoices. The related revenue is initially based on forward\nmarket selling prices for the quotational periods stipulated in the contracts with changes between the\nprovisional price and the final price recorded in revenues. For contracts with variable pricing dependent on\nthe content of mineral in the product delivered, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to\nwhich it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the products.\nFinal invoices are typically issued after the commodities have been received and analyzed (with customer\napproval of quantities, moisture, and mineral content). Accounts receivables are then remeasured in\naccordance with each contract.\nThe fair value of the sale price adjustment is reassessed at each reporting date, based on all variable\npricing elements.\nThe Company periodically measures expected credit losses. The Company considers the history and\nfinancial conditions of its customer. The Company did not recognize any credit losses in these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n-14-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\n7.

The cost is determined using the\nweighted average cost method for the purchase of materials. The cost of finished goods and work in\nprogress comprises of consumable materials, labor and other direct costs (based on normal production\ncapacity). The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, minus\nthe estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to realize the sales.\n8.

The Company continuously operated with positive margins during the nine-month\nperiod ended September 30, 2024, and, accordingly, no impairment loss was recognized.\nAccounting policy\nThe property, plant and equipment are recorded at acquisition, formation or construction cost less accumulated\ndepreciation or depletion and impairment. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the\nremaining useful life of the assets, whichever is the shorter. Mining rights are calculated based on the volume of\nore extracted.\nAn item of equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise\nfrom the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising from an asset disposal, determined as the difference\n-17-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nbetween the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, is recognized in the consolidated\nstatements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nWhere an item of equipment consists of major components with different useful lives, the components are\naccounted for as separate items of equipment. Expenditures incurred to replace a component of an item of\nequipment that is accounted for separately, including major inspection and overhaul expenditures, are capitalized.\nNon-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by\nwhich the asset´s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. For the purposes of assessing impairment,\nassets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGU).\nAssets under construction\nAssets under construction are capitalized as work-in-progress until the asset is available for use. The cost of work-\nin-progress includes costs transferred from Deferred exploration and evaluation expenditure and any costs directly\nattributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. Directly attributable costs are\ncapitalized until the asset is in a location and condition necessary for operation as intended by management.\nThese costs include: the purchase price, installation costs, site preparation costs, research and development\ncosts, freight charges, transportation insurance costs, duties, testing and preparation charges, borrowing costs\nand estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.\nCosts incurred on mineral properties in the development stage are included in the carrying amount of the\ndevelopment project in assets under construction. Development stage expenditures are costs incurred to obtain\naccess to proven and probable mineral reserves or mineral resources and provide facilities extracting, treating,\ngathering, transporting, and storing the minerals. All expenditures incurred during the development stage until the\nasset is ready for its intended use are capitalized.\nAssets under construction are not depreciated. When an asset becomes available for use, its costs are transferred\nfrom assets under construction into the appropriate asset classification such as mineral properties, buildings,\nmachinery, fixture, and plant. Depreciation commences once the asset is complete and available for use.\n12.

Such costs include,\namong others, geological, geophysical studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, feasibility studies and technical\nreports. The carrying value of the Company’s Deferred exploration and evaluation expenditure is assessed for\nimpairment when indicators of such impairment exist. Indicators may include the loss of the right to explore in the\narea; the Company deciding not to continue exploring or incurring substantial additional expenditures on the\nproject; or it being determined that the carrying amount of the project is unlikely to be recovered by its development\n-18-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nor sale. If any indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount is calculated to\ndetermine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.\nDeferred exploration and evaluation expenses represent mineral rights developed by the Company, which have\nnot been confirmed as technically and commercially viable through technical reports. When confirmed, deferred\nexploration and evaluation expenses will be transferred to each operating asset they pertain in accordance with\ntheir nature.\nThe Company capitalizes the depreciation of lease contracts on certain properties in order to explore and evaluate\nthe mineral properties as part of the exploration and evaluation expenditures.\n13.

On\nDecember 13, 2022, Sigma Brazil drew down US$60 million (equivalent to $82 million). The balance of US$40\nmillion (equivalent to $54 million) was disbursed in two subsequent drawdowns of US$20 million each, on\nFebruary 28, 2023, and on March 16, 2023.\nThe Company paid at inception of the agreement $15,761 (Note 10) as collateral, based on an amount equal to\ntwelve months of interest accrual for the first interest period, and an upfront fee of $3,665. Principal repayments\nof the Loan are due 48 days after the end of the Company’s first and third quarters ending March 31 and\nSeptember 30, respectively, each year, being the first measurement date, the third quarter ended September 30,\n2023. Repayments will be determined based on an amount\nequivalent to 50% of the Company’s net cash generated from operating activities plus 50% of the net cash\ngenerated from investing activities for the prior six-month period ended March 31 and September 30. In the six-\nmonth period ended March 31, 2024, the Company presented net cash that determined the repayment in the\namount of $3,114 paid in May 2024. During the six-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company had\nno net cash generated that could have triggered repayment of principal on November 18th.\nThe loan contains an embedded prepayment feature, whereby the Company must pay an early prepayment\npremium of 4% during the first year of the loan, reducing proportionately from 4% to 1% after the first anniversary,\nfinishing at 1% at the end of the fourth year. The fair value of this embedded derivative has been estimated and\ndoes not differ significantly from the nominal amount and, accordingly, no adjustments were made, since it is\nclosely related to the primary indexation of the loan.\nThe loan is guaranteed by the Company's assets, rights, licenses, receivables, contracts (with flexibility to\nenter/terminate/amend offtake agreements) and a pledge of 100% of Sigma Lithium Holdings Inc’s share interest\nin Sigma Brazil. The security will rank first in respect to all existing and future indebtedness of the Company,\nexcept in relation to permitted indebtedness of up to USD100 million and R$100 million.\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized interest expense on this\nagreement in the amount of $4,259\nb) Banco de Desenvolvimento de Minas Gerais - BDMG\nThe Company entered into a financing agreement with BDMG Bank. The first tranche of $3,084 was received on\nJanuary 13, 2023, and $768 on November 14, 2023. This financing entails quarterly interest payments and\nincludes a 24-month grace period for principal amortization. Principal repayment occurs over 60 monthly\ninstallments, with the first installment due on December 15, 2024. The financing carries an annual interest rate of\n3.75%.\nOn October 24, 2023, the Company entered into another financing agreement with BDMG Bank for $9,449, the\nfirst tranche of $8,607 was received in December 2023 and secund tranche of $789 received in May 2024. Like\nthe previous agreement, this financing involves quarterly interest payments and a 24-month grace period for\nprincipal amortization. Principal repayment is scheduled over 60 monthly installments, with the first installment\ndue on December 7, 2025. The interest of this loan is 3.88% per annum.\nAdditionally on May 9, 2024, the Company entered into another financing agreement with BDMG Bank for $8,234.\nLike the previous agreement, this financing involves quarterly interest payments and a 24-month grace period for\nprincipal amortization. Principal repayment is scheduled over 60 monthly installments, with the first installment\ndue on Mayl 30, 2026. The interest of this loan is 3.93% + SELIC per annum.\nAccounting policy\nBorrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently\nmeasured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption\namount is recognized in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees\n-23-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\npaid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as loan transaction costs of the facility amount drawn\ndown.\nBorrowings are derecognized from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract\nis discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has\nbeen extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any noncash assets\ntransferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss as other income or finance costs.\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement\nof the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.\nThe Company also analyses whether there are embedded derivatives in its sales and purchase contracts, as well\nas in its loan agreements. Changes in the fair value of any of these derivative instruments are recognized\nimmediately in the statement of loss, unless they are closely related to the primary indexation of the contracts and\nagreements.\n16. Lease liability\nThe lease liabilities are primarily related to land leases of surface properties owned by Miazga Participações S.A.\n(“Miazga”), a related party and Arqueana, a related party (note 13) being the remaining lease contracts for land,\napartments and houses, commercial rooms and vehicle leases with third parties.\nThe lease agreements have terms between 1 year to 12 years and the liability was measured at the present value\nof the lease payments discounted using interest rates with a weighted average rate of 8.37% (8.37% on December\n2023) which was determined to be the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.\nThe changes in lease liabilities are shown in the following table:\nDescription 9/30/2024 12/31/2023\nOpening balances 5,727 3,669\nAdditions - 4,823\nInterest expense 258 456\nDisposal (6) (1,738)\nPayments (1,284) (1,423)\nOthers (22) (356)\nForeign currency translation adjustment of subsidiary (470) 296\nLease Liability total 4,203 5,727\nCurrent 1,658 2,132\nNon-Current 2,545 3,595\nMaturity analysis - contractual undiscounted cash flows\nAs of September 30, 2024\nLess than one year 1,658\nYear 2 1,241\nYear 3 401\nYear 4 235\nYear 5 203\nMore than 5 years 465\nTotal contractual undiscounted cash flows 4,203\nAccounting policy\n-24-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nAt inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease by determining\nwhether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for\nconsideration, except for:\n• Leases of low value assets;\n• Leases with a duration of twelve months or less; and\n• Leases to explore for minerals, oil, natural gas, or similar non-regenerative resources.\nA right-of-use \"ROU\" asset and lease liability is recognized at the lease commencement date.\nThe ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for\nany lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any\nlease incentives received. The ROU asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the\ncommencement date to the end of the lease term, including periods covered by an option to extend the lease if\nthe Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. In addition, the ROU asset is periodically reduced by\nimpairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The Company presents\nROU assets within property, plant and equipment.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the\ncommencement date. The lease payments are discounted using the implicit interest rate in the lease. Variable\nlease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability.\nIf the interest rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental interest rate of borrowing is used.\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method whereby the\nbalance is increased by interest expense and decreased by lease payments. It is remeasured when there is a\nchange in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Company’s\nestimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Company changes its\nassessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n17. Prepayment from customer\nRefers to payments made in excess due to the provisional pricing applied at the time of invoicing, with the final\namount subject to adjustments based on all variable pricing elements outlined in the sales contract. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the outstanding balance was $8,247. The outstanding balance of $2,154 on December 31,\n2023, referred to a prepayment of the first sale of the Company which was returned to the customer in February\n2024. That amount had to be returned to the customer since it was in excess due to the price decrease of lithium\nafter the sale was recognized.\nAccounting policy\nPrepayment from customers consists of amounts received in advance when purchasing the products. Advances\nreceived are recorded as a liability, represented by the contractual obligation to deliver the products.\n18.

Management\nperiodically assesses the positions taken in the tax calculations with respect to situations where applicable tax\nregulations are open to interpretation. The Company recognizes provisions where appropriate, based on the\nestimated payments to tax authorities. The income tax and social contribution expense comprises current and\ndeferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless they are related to items\nrecognized directly in shareholders’ equity.\nCurrent tax expense is the expected payment of taxable income for the year, using the nominal rate approved or\nsubstantially approved on the balance sheet date, and any adjustment of taxes payable related to previous years.\nCurrent income tax and social contribution are presented net as liabilities when there are amounts payable, or in\nassets when the amounts paid in advance exceed the total due on the date of the report.\nDeferred tax is recognized in relation to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and\ntheir book values in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not recognized when it is probable that it will not\nrevert in a foreseeable future in accordance with IAS 12 – Taxes on Profit. The amount of the deferred tax\ndetermined is based on the expectation of realization or settlement of the temporary difference and uses the\nnominal rate approved or substantially approved.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented net in the balance sheet whenever there is a legal right\nand the intention to offset them upon the calculation of current taxes, usually related to the same legal entity and\nthe same taxation authority.\nDeferred income tax and social contribution assets are recognized on recoverable balances of tax loss\ncarryforward and social contribution negative basis, tax credits and deductible temporary differences. Such assets\nare reviewed at each year-end date and will be reduced to the extent that their realization is less likely to occur.\n20. Asset retirement obligations (“ARO”)\nIn December 2023 the Company updated the appraisal that resulted in a decrease of the provision by $3,279,\nmainly due to:\n• review of the affected area;\n• cash outflow estimate update; and\n• updating the discount rate.\nThe Company has estimated its asset retirement obligation amounting to $3,630 on September 30, 2024 ($3,836\non December 31, 2023), representing the present value of estimated future retirement costs to remediate\nenvironmental damages on September 30, 2024. It is based on estimated future retirement costs of $6,035 a real\ndiscount rate of 5.96% (December 31, 2023, was 5.96%).\nOf the $3,630 of asset retirement obligation recognized as of September 30, 2024, $2,370 is related to Phase I\n(Xuxa mine) which was classified within property, plant and equipment, and the remaining $1,260 relating to\nPhase II (Barreiro mine) was classified within Deferred exploration and evaluation expenditure.\n-27-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nDescription 9/30/2024 12/31/2023\nOpening balances 3,836 6,547\nReversal of present value adjustment 163 414\nReversal of fixed assets - (758)\nReversal of exploration assets - (2,821)\nForeign currency translation adjustment of subsidiary (369) 454\nAsset retirement obligation total 3,630 3,836\nAccounting Policy\nMining processing activities normally give rise to legal or constructive obligations for environmental rehabilitation\nand the decommissioning of facilities. These activities can include, among others, removal or treatment of waste\nmaterials and land rehabilitation, according to environmental regulations. The extent of costs associated with the\nretirement of assets are based on the requirements of authorities and environmental policies.\nThe provision reflects the risks and probability of future cash flows required to settle the obligation. The expected\nrehabilitation costs are estimated based on the cost of external contractors performing the work. This provision is\nupdated each reporting period for changes to expected cash flows and for the effect of changes in the discount\nrate, and the change in estimate is added or deducted from the related asset and depreciated over the expected\neconomic life of the operation to which it relates. The unwinding of the discount, referred to as accretion expense,\nis included in finance costs and results in an increase in the amount of the provision.\nWhen provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognized, the corresponding cost is capitalized as an\nasset, representing part of the cost of the future economic benefits of the operation.

Financial instruments\na) Identification and measurement of financial instruments\nThe Company enters into transactions involving various financial instruments, mainly cash and cash equivalents,\nincluding short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable to suppliers, and loans and export\nprepayment, which may contain embedded derivatives.\nThe amounts recorded in current assets and current liabilities have immediate liquidity or short-term maturity,\nmostly less than three months. Considering the maturities and features of such instruments, their carrying\namounts approximate their fair values.\n• Classification of financial instruments (consolidated)\n9/30/2024 12/31/2023\nMeasured Fair value Measured Fair value\nat through at through\nNote\namortized profit and amortized profit and\nDescription cost loss (1) cost loss(*)\nAssets\nCurrent\nCash and cash equivalents 5 88,645 - 64,403 -\nTrade accounts receivable 6 - 20,109 - 29,693\nA Nc oc no -u cn ut rs\nr\nere nc\nt\neivable from related parties 13 12 - 14 -\nLoan and accounts receivable from related parties 13 16,760 - 13,160 -\nCash held as collateral 10 15,564 - 15,269 -\n120,981 20,109 92,846 29,693\nLiabilities\n-28-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nCurrent\nSuppliers 14 47,645 - 59,826 -\nLoans and export prepayment 15 94,573 - 28,907 -\nAccounts payable 9,951 - 11,326 -\nPrepayment from customer 17 - 8,247 - -\nNon-current\nLoans and export prepayment 15 150,274 - 141,999 -\n302,443 8,247 242,058 -\n(1) Fair Value through profit and loss is classified as Level 2.\nb) Financial risk management:\nThe Company uses risk management strategies in which the nature and general position of financial risks are\nregularly monitored and managed to assess results and the financial impact on cash flow.\nThe Company is exposed to exchange rates, interest rates, market price, credit risk and liquidity risks.\n• Foreign Exchange rate risk\nThe exposure arises from the existence of assets and liabilities generated in Dollar, since the Company's\nfunctional currency is the Brazilian Real.\nThe consolidated exposure as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nDescription 9/30/2024 12/31/2023\nCanadian dollars\nCash and cash equivalents 47 68\nSuppliers (770) (779)\nAccount payables (6,151) (6,136)\nOther current liabilities (43) (67)\n(6,917) (6,914)\nUnited States dollar\nCash and cash equivalents 57,340 4,557\nTrade accounts receivable 14,880 22,400\nPrepayment from customer (6,103) (1,624)\nInterest on export prepayment agreement (11,197) (11,689)\nExport prepayment agreement (155,759) (109,644)\n(100,839) (96,000)\n• Sensitivity analysis\nWe present below the sensitivity analysis for foreign exchange risks.

Provisionally priced receivables are subsequently measured at fair\nvalue through profit and loss under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”. The final selling price for all provisionally\npriced products is based on forward market price based on the contract terms stipulated. The change in value of\nthe provisionally priced receivable is based on relevant forward market prices. For contracts with variable pricing\ndependent on the content of mineral in the product delivered, the Company estimates the amount of consideration\nto which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the products. The fair value of the final sale price adjustment\nis reassessed at each reporting date, based on all variable pricing elements and any changes are recognized as\noperational revenue in the statement of loss.\nThe sensitivity of the Company’s risk related to the final settlement of provisional pricing accounts receivable\nexpected to be determined during the second quarter of 2024 is detailed below:\nProvisional Effect on\nVolume (kt (3)) Price Variation Sales Revenue\nCAD\nHigh grade lithium concentrate (Probable) (1) 74,753\nUSD 757 / (USD 52) /\n5,300\n$1,022 ($71)\nHigh grade lithium concentrate (+20%) (2) 74,753\nUSD 809/ USD 162 /\n16,346\n$1,093 $219\nHigh grade lithium concentrate (-20%) (2) 74,753\nUSD 809/ (USD 162) /\n(16,346)\n$1,093 ($219)\n(1) The sensitivity analysis for the probable scenario was measured using October 31, 2024, futures price from the Guangzhou\nFutures Exchange as a reference, with an exchange rate of USD 1.00 to $1.3514.\n(2) Provisional price on September 30, 2024.\n(3) Total volume of contracts with exposure to market price fluctuation\n• Credit risk\nThe credit risk management policy aims to minimize the possibility of not receiving sales made and amounts\ninvested, deposited or guaranteed by financial institutions and counterparties, through analysis, granting and\nmanagement of credits, using quantitative and qualitative parameters.\nThe Company manages its credit risk by receiving in advance a substantial portion of its sales or by being\nguaranteed by letters of credit.\nCredit granted to financial institutions is used to accept guarantees and invest cash surpluses.\n• Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The\nCompany’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due.\nThe Company’s management of cash is focused on funding ongoing capital needs for operating the Greentech\nPlant, developing the Company’s growth opportunities (including Phase 2) and for general corporate\n-31-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nexpenditures. Management intends to use cash generated by its operating activities to meet its obligations. To\nthe extent the Company does not believe it has sufficient liquidity to meet obligations, it will consider securing\nadditional equity or debt funding.\nThe Company continuously monitors its cash outflows and seeks opportunities to minimize all costs, to the extent\npossible, as well as its general and administrative expenses.\nThe following table shows the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including accrued interest.\nMore than\nContractual obligations Up to 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years 5 years Total\nSuppliers 47,645 - - - 47,645\nAccounts payable 9,951 - - - 9,951\nLoans and export prepayment 94,573 133,793 8,544 7,937 244,847\nLease liabilities 1,658 1,642 438 465 4,203\na) Capital Management\nThe Company seeks to optimize its capital structure in order to reduce its financial costs and maximize the\nreturn to its shareholders.

The fair values of other long-term assets\nand liabilities do not differ significantly from their carrying amounts, including the export prepayment agreement\nand BDMG loan, since both are based on floating interest rates such as BSBY and SELIC, respectively. Given\nthe very specific condition of the export prepayment loan, the Company was not able to quantify an equivalent\nloan with similar condition for the same borrower that could be considered to measure the fair value for this facility.\nAccounting Policy\nRecognition\nThe Company recognizes a financial asset or financial liability on the consolidated statement of financial position\nwhen it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Financial assets are initially\nmeasured at fair value and are derecognized either when the Company has transferred substantially all the risks\nand rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or when cash flows expire. Financial liabilities are initially\nmeasured at fair value and are derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled\nor expired.\nA write-off of a financial asset (or a portion thereof) constitutes a derecognition event. Write-offs occur when the\nCompany has no reasonable expectations of recovering the contractual cash flows of a financial asset.\nClassification and Measurement\n-32-\nSigma Lithium Corporation\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nNine-month Period Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nThe Company determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition. Financial assets and\nfinancial liabilities are classified according to the following measurement categories:\n• those to be measured subsequently at fair value, either through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) or through other\ncomprehensive loss (“FVTOCI”); and,\n• those to be measured subsequently at amortized cost.\nThe classification and measurement of financial assets after initial recognition at fair value depends on the\nbusiness model for managing the financial asset and the contractual terms of the cash flows. Financial assets\nthat are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have\ncontractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding, are generally\nmeasured at amortized cost at each subsequent reporting period. All other financial assets are measured at their\nfair values at each subsequent reporting period, with any changes recorded through profit or loss or through other\ncomprehensive income (which designation is made as an irrevocable election at the time of recognition).\nAfter initial recognition at fair value, financial liabilities are classified and measured at either:\n(a) amortized cost.\n(b) FVTPL, if the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of recognition, or when required or,\n(c) FVTOCI, when the change in fair value is attributable to changes in the Company’s credit risk.\nTransaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of a financial asset or financial liability\nclassified as amortized cost are included in the fair value of the instrument on initial recognition.\nTransaction costs for financial assets and financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss are\nexpensed in profit or loss.\nThe Company’s financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, loan and accounts receivable from related\nparties, which are classified as amortized cost, and trade accounts receivable which are measured at fair value\nthrough profit and loss. The Company’s financial liabilities consist of suppliers, accounts payable and loan and\nexport prepayment agreements, which are classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the\neffective interest method.\nAll financial instruments recognized at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position are classified\ninto one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy as follows:\nLevel 1 – Valuation based on quoted prices (unadjusted) observed in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 2 – Valuation techniques based on inputs that are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets;\nquoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices\nused in a valuation model that are observable for that instrument; and inputs that are derived from or corroborated\nby observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 – Valuation techniques with significant unobservable market inputs.\nImpairment\nThe Company assesses all information available, including on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses\nassociated with any financial assets carried at amortized cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on\nwhether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. To assess whether there is a significant increase in\ncredit risk, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the\nrisk of default as at the date of initial recognition based on all information available, and reasonable and supportive\nforward-looking information.\n22.

Consequently, the final settlement value may differ from the initial\nrecorded value. Changes in this value are permanently monitored during the quotational period of each shipment\nand any provisional pricing adjustments are recognized as revenue in the statement of loss. Sales at the outset\nare booked net of grade and moisture adjustments based on the assessment at the Brazilian port.\nAccounting Policy\nThe Company’s primarily generates revenue from the sales of lithium oxide concentrate to customers and\nrecognizes its revenues once all the following conditions are satisfied:\n• Identification of the contract for sale of goods or provision of services.\n• Identification of the performance obligations.\n• Determination of the contract value.\n• Determination of the value allocated to each performance obligation included int the contract; and\n• At the time performance obligation is completed.\nThe Company recognizes revenues from export sales when control of the product is transferred to customers,\nwhich occurs when the product is either loaded on the ship or delivered in a customs warehouse under control of\nthe clients.\nThe export is primarily realized pursuant to the Incoterm Cost, Insurance and Freight (“CIF”) and Freight On Board\n(“FOB”), under which the performance obligation for product sales is satisfied when the products are loaded on\nthe ship and the performance obligation for the transportation service is satisfied when the products are delivered\nto the destination port. Cost, Insurance and Freight (“CIF”) and Cost and Freight (“CFR”) are also regularly\nassessed. CIF and CFR include sea freight service embedded in the same invoice. In this case, the performance\nobligation of the sea freight service is considered separately from the shipment of lithium and the Company\nrecognizes revenue from the provision of this service upon delivery of the goods to the destination specified by\ncustomers.\nOperating revenue from the sale of goods in the regular course of business is measured at the fair value of the\nconsideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the delivery of the goods or services promised to\nthe customers. Accordingly, the Company’s sales are subject to provisional pricing adjustments and revenues are\nestimated based on prices for lithium expected until the agreed upon settlement date.\nFor the portion of the Company’s lithium export sales pursuant to the Incoterms “Cost, Insurance and Freight –\nCIF” and “Cost and Freight – CFR”, the obligation to pay for the goods and the sea freight service, which is\nembedded in the same invoice, generally arises when the product is loaded on the ship.

Legal claim contingency\nThe Company is a party to arbitration filed on November 4, 2022. The Company’s management, advised by its\nlegal counsel assessed, as of September 30, 2024, the likelihood of loss as partially remote and partially probable.\nThe probable loss connected to this arbitration amounts to $370 as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company is a party to a labor dispute filed in Ontario’s Superior Court of Justice on March 18, 2024. The\nCompany’s management, advised by its legal counsel, assessed the likelihood of loss as probable, amounting to\n$2.136 million, as of September 30, 2024.\nAdditionally, the Company is a party to other proceedings classified by legal advisors as possible loss, therefore\nrepresenting present obligations whose cash outflow is not probable. Thus, no provision has been made for any\nliabilities in these consolidated financial statements.\nNature 9/30/2024 12/31/2023\nRegulatory 193 -\nCivil (1) 3,046 -\nLabor 504 497\n3,743 497\n(1) Sigma Brazil is a party to an arbitration filed on June 26, 2024, amounting to $7,947.37, out of which\n$4,903.47 is recognized in the Company's statement, as per note 14 (suppliers’ costs). The Company’s\nmanagement, advised by its legal counsel, assessed the likelihood of loss as possible.\nOn March 18, 2024, the Company received an Initiation Letter of Arbitration by LG Group subsidiary, LG Energy\nSolution, Ltd. (“LG-ES“) from the International Centre for Dispute Resolution of the American Arbitration\nAssociation. LG-ES is alleging that Sigma Lithium is in breach of certain provisions in connection with the Term-\nSheet dated October 5, 2021, relating to offtake arrangements for the purchase of lithium concentrate from the\nCompany. The Term-Sheet was subject to, amongst other things, completion of the negotiation of definitive written\nagreements between the parties. The Company believes the claims are without merit. The legal counsel of the\nCompany has formally attributed the probability of LG prevailing in this arbitration as remote.\nAccounting Policy\nA provision is recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past\nevent, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount\nof the obligation can be reliably estimated, If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the\nexpected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money\nand, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. A provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the\nexpected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting\nits obligations under the contract.\n31.

Subsequent Events\nGovernment grants\nOn October 4th, the Superintendence of SUDENE approved Sigma Lithium for the tax benefit of a 75% reduction\nin CIT (a federal tax), also known as Profit from Exploration, and issued the Constitutive Report. This tax benefit\nwill allow the company to reduce its current CIT expenses by approximately 75%, starting in 2024, for the next\nten years. The tax incentive received by Sigma can be granted to new ventures located in the SUDENE, SUDAM\nareas, Espírito Santo, and cities in northern Minas Gerais (such as Araçuaí and Itinga) and applies to projects for\nimplementation, modernization, expansion, or diversification of these companies. The amount saved cannot be\ndistributed to the partners and will be added to a reserve account for tax incentives within the equity accounts.\nWe estimate that the benefit to be recognized by Sigma in 2024 is, to date, approximately BRL 14,0 million\nLoans and financing – BNDES\nOn October 10, 2024, Sigma Lithium signed the final agreement securing a BRL486.8 million development loan\nfrom the National Brazilian Bank for Economic and Social Development (“BNDES”) to fund the construction of a\nsecond Greentech carbon neutral industrial plant for lithium concentrate at Vale do Jequitinhonha in Brazil. The\nCompany is required to provide a letter of credit (“bank guarantee”) issued by a BNDES registered financial\ninstitution in advance of first drawdown.\n* * *\n-43-"

The\nCompany’s existing Phase 1 operations and planned tripling of capacity through Phase 2 and 3 expansions\nrepresent one of the largest hard rock lithium mining and beneficiation complexes in the world. Our assets are\nlocated in the municipalities of Araçuaí ́and Itinga in the northeastern part of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The\nCompany owns 100% of the operating assets indirectly through its wholly-owned subsidiary Sigma Mineração\nS.A. (“Sigma Brazil”), with the leasehold area comprised of 29 mineral rights (which include mining concessions,\napplications for mining concessions, exploration authorizations, applications for mineral exploration\nauthorizations) spread over 185 km2, located within the broader 19,000-hectare land package held by Sigma\nBrazil (containing the Grota do Cirilo, Sao Jose, Genipapo and Santa Clara properties).\nSigma’s operations are vertically integrated, with the Company’s mines supplying spodumene bearing material to\nits lithium production and processing plant (the “Greentech Plant”). The Greentech Plant is designed and\noperated to produce a 5.1% to 6.0% high purity lithium concentrate (“Green Lithium”), engineered to the\n| 1\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\nspecifications of the Company’s customers in the rapidly expanding lithium-ion battery supply chain for electric\nvehicles (“EVs”), in an environmentally friendly way through a fully automated and digital dense medium\nseparation (“DMS”) technology process. The Greentech Plant was built after the completion of engineering to the\nlevel of Front-End Loading Level 3 (“FEL-3”) stage precision and extensive testing at the Company’s on-site\ndemonstration pilot plant, which had been in operation since late 2018 and ceased operations upon\ncommissioning of the Company’s Phase 1 Greentech Plant.\nSigma is taking a phased approach to its operations, with production at its Phase 1 Greentech Plant and\nassociated mine commencing in April 2023. At 270,000 tonnes per annum of 5.5% lithium oxide concentrate\nproduction capacity, Phase 1 has positioned the Company as a globally relevant, Tier-1, concentrate producer.\nThe Company is active in expanding its production footprint having issued a Final Investment Decision (“FID”) on\nits Phase 2 project on April 1, 2024. Phase 2 would take consolidated capacity to 520,000 tonnes per annum of\n5.5% concentrate. The existing shared infrastructure built with the Phase 1 Greentech Plant is expected to support\ntwo additional production lines, with each of the eventual 3 phases designed to follow a similar flowsheet as\ndemonstrated at Phase 1.\nThe Sigma Greentech Plants also produce a low-grade, high-purity, zero-chemical, hypofine by-product (“Green\nBy-Products”) at approximately 1.3% lithium oxide (“Li2O”). Depending on market conditions, these Green By-\nProducts can be sold to strengthen Sigma’s ESG-centric approach to pioneer a “zero tailings” environmental\nsustainability strategy, minimizing the environmental footprint of tailings storage with a positive ecosystem impact,\nwhile also generating an additional revenue stream to the Company.\nAs the Company’s mission statement has been guided by adhering to the highest level of environmental, social\nand governance (“ESG”) practices since inception in 2012, the Company has developed in a sustainable way.\nAdditionally, the Company is focused on social programs promoting sustainable development, inclusion (including\non the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”)), and upskilling local people in the region where we operate.\nAs a result, the Company has committed to the strategies outlined in Table 1 below, to advance the development\nof its operations in a responsible and sustainable way. The Company is proud to report that it has successfully\ndelivered on its “net zero carbon” program through the purchase of carbon credit “in-setting”, achieving “quintuple\nzero” production from the onset. Over the longer term, Sigma plans to build upon its ESG commitments through\nmore innovative programs including increasing its trucking fleet's fuel consumption to a target of 50% biofuels.\nTable 1: Summary of Sigma’s ESG-Driven Decisions & Strategies\nSustainable\nGovernance Greentech Plant\nDevelopment\nCEO / Co- Chairpersons: 100% / 50% female (1) Zero net carbon, tailings\nPhase 1 built as two pits to\ndams and hazardous\nBoard Independence: 60% independent (2) preserve seasonal stream\nchemicals\nBoard Committees: Members Independence: 75%\nindependent (3) Social programs / Zero potable water use\ncommitment to local hiring\nBoard Diversity: 40% female representatives / LGBTQ\nand training 100% green hydro power\nrepresentation (4)\n(1) The Company’s CEO is female (100%); and the Board of Directors has two chairpersons whose one (50%) is female.\n(2) The Board of directors has five members, and three of them (60%) are independent.\n(3) Three of the four Board Committees are chaired by independent directors (75%).\n(4) The Board of directors has two members (40%) that represent women and LGBTQ community.\nCORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS\nYear to date 2024 the Company notes the following corporate highlights:\n▪ Sigma Lithium’s Board of Directors issued a FID on the Phase 2 expansion project on April 1, 2024;\n▪ The site team has begun wildlife and flora suppression in preparation for broader earthworks;\n▪ The Company has completed eight shipments of its quintuple zero green lithium concentrate;\n| 2\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\n▪ On July 9, 2024, the Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders (“ASM”) took place, where the\nshareholders approved: (i) the election of the Board, to be comprised of Ana Cristina Cabral, Marcelo\nPaiva, Bechara S.

The final value at settlement may differ from initial book value, and changes in said\nvalue are permanently monitored in the lithium market and any provisional pricing adjustments are recognized as\nrevenue in the statement of loss.\nCost of Goods Sold\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s cost of goods sold for the nine-month period ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023.\nCost of goods sold For the nine-month ended\n(in C$ 000s) 9/30/2024 9/30/2023 Change\nMining costs\nSalaries and benefits (3,010) (259) (2,751)\nMining service providers (31,201) (9,022) (22,179)\nBlasting and fuels (17,453) (4,603) (12,850)\nEquipment rental (429) (568) 139\nOthers (4,913) 6 (4,919)\nTotal (57,006) (14,446) (42,560)\nProcessing costs\nSalaries and benefits (10,201) (1,781) (8,420)\nFuels (1,317) (1,775) 458\nConsumables (2,732) (7,568) 4,836\nEquipment rental (1,260) (2,315) 1,055\nTaxes and fees (6) (294) 288\nUtilities (1,225) (105) (1,120)\nPlant Services (4,864) - (4,864)\nEquipment services (638) - (638)\nInsurance (1,282) - (1,282)\n| 23\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\nMobile Crusher (1,984) - (1,984)\nOthers (4,200) (915) (3,285)\nTotal (29,709) (14,753) (14,956)\nDistribution costs\nFreight (8,094) (8,814) 720\nInsurance (57) - (57)\nWarehouse (634) - (634)\nPort Operations (2,400) (1,090) (1,310)\nExpedition (658) - (658)\nFreight Maritime (3,292) - (3,292)\nDemurrage (436) - (436)\nOthers (90) - (90)\nTotal (15,661) (9,904) (5,757)\nRoyalties\nRoyalties (4,202) (3,726) (476)\nTotal (4,202) (3,726) (476)\nDepletion and Depreciation\nDepletion (5,148) (1,737) (3,411)\nDepreciation (7,441) (2,530) (4,911)\nTotal (12,589) (4,267) (8,322)\nCost of goods sold total (119,167) (47,096) (72,071)\nTotal costs of goods sold increased by $72.0 million, or 153.0%, to $119.2 million for the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $47.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to an\nincrease of 131.8% in sales volume since the Company had only three months of sales activities in the nine-month\nperiod ended September 30, 2023 compared to nine months in 2024.

This includes the communication of the\nCompany’s whistleblower policy and the preparation and selection of appropriate methods for communicating\nexternal information;\n▪ An ineffective monitoring process to ensure controls are periodically evaluated, results of testing are\ncommunicated to senior management and the board of directors and the control deficiencies are tracked for\nremediation on a timely basis; and\n▪ Ineffective control activities due to the (i) failure to deploy general control activities over information\ntechnology (ii) failure to document policies and procedures and (iii) failure to document control activities to\nmitigate risks.\nThe control deficiencies resulted in immaterial misstatements to the consolidated financial statements.\nFurthermore, the control deficiencies described above created a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nTherefore we concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company engaged KPMG Auditores Independentes Ltda. (“KPMG Ltda.”) to perform an “integrated audit”\nwhich encompassed an opinion on the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, as well as an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s ICFR as of\nDecember 31, 2023.

These remediation\nefforts are ongoing, and the Company intends to sustain its initiatives aimed at enhancing the internal control\nenvironment, a task that will demand significant efforts throughout 2024 and possibly into 2025.\nThroughout 2023 and to the present, we conducted a comprehensive review of our internal control procedures\nand have been actively pursuing steps to address and remediate the identified material weaknesses. The\nCompany:\n(i) engaged external consultants to assist Management in assessing its internal control over financial\nreporting, mapping all existing control deficiencies, defining remediation plans and formed a team\nresponsible for redesigning processes and developing process automation, including those related to\naccounting and reporting;\n| 30\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\n(ii) strengthened the accounting and reporting team by hiring more experienced people, which resulted\nin replacement of key-personnel as well as the reducing reliance on third parties engaged in the\naccounting, tax and reporting activities;\n(iii) implemented new procedures to enhance accuracy in the interim and annual filings. This includes\ndeveloping a detailed financial statement closing schedule to oversee preparation, completion, and\nquality control. Additionally, we introduced the Disclosure and Content Guide, a comprehensive\nchecklist ensuring compliance with all financial reporting requirements. Although is not documented\nas a control, senior management now conducts additional layers of review to ensure the accuracy of\nthe filings;\n(iv) took steps to improve our information technology (IT) controls and infrastructure. These efforts include\naddressing IT general control (ITGC) activities, establishing relevant policies and procedures, and\nengaging external SAP developers to implement IT system improvements and address gaps in the IT\nstructure. Additionally, measures have been implemented in 2024 involved collaborating with SAP\ndevelopers to map existing gaps, enhance ITGC, and establish policies and procedures for the IT\norganization structure. This included the development of a Data Security Policy and an Access Control\nPolicy;\n(v) approved a new version of the Company’s Code of Ethics in Portuguese on March 18, 2024. This\nupdated Code of Ethics will be disseminated to all employees and accompanied by training sessions\nthroughout 2024. Sigma is committed to operating with integrity and is strengthening its Code of Ethics\nacross all levels and jurisdictions, as part of efforts to foster a culture of controls and compliance;\n(vi) approved a supplier’s code of ethics on March 18, 2024, establishing rules for the relationship of the\nsuppliers with our employers, authorities, and communities.\nFurther steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above that the Company is pursuing including the\nfollowing:\na. Control environment: We are committed to continuously identifying, training, and retaining personnel\nwith the necessary skills and experience in designing, operating, and documenting internal controls over\nfinancial reporting. Additionally, we plan to expand our finance staff to enhance the segregation of duties\nand responsibilities.\nb. Risk assessment: The Company is redesigning all financial reporting that will enhance risk assessment\nprocess, document the process understanding, creating flowchart, identifying process risk point and\ncontrol to address it;\nc. Information and communication: The Company is redesigning its whistleblower channel to make it user\nfriendly and stimulate the usage thereof as a tool for important external and internal communication. We\nwill continue enhancing data reliability and internal controls, harmonizing our IT controls, and addressing\ncurrent system limitations.\nd. Monitoring activities: The financial and accounting team will work with external specialists to bring in\nexpertise and expedite the remediation of control deficiencies at the process level during 2024 with a focus\non the controls matrix for process underlying all significant accounts and disclosures. The external\nspecialists with expertise in internal controls implementation are assisting with the development and\ndocumentation of the following workstreams related to the internal controls over financial reporting needed\nto be in compliance with SOX (“Sarbanes Oxley”): (i) prepare and review the risks and controls matrix; (ii)\nestablish a Project Management Office to manage the control deficiencies and remediation; (iii) develop\nand document structured policies and procedures; (iv) test the design, implementation and operating\neffectiveness of the internal controls after remediation to support the CEO and CFO certifications; and (v)\nsupport training content development and conducting training sessions across the Company.\n| 31\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\ne. Control activities: We will continue to refine our control activities to mitigate risks and ensure the\nachievement of objectives, designing and implementing controls activities and IT general controls over all\nthe processes in order to address the process risk point.\nWe are confident that our remediation plan will adequately address the identified material weaknesses\nand bolster our internal control over financial reporting. Management will continue to review and make\nnecessary changes to the overall design and operation of the Company’s internal control environment, as\nwell as the policies and procedures to improve the overall effectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate\nfor a sufficient period of time and management concludes, through testing, that these controls are\noperating effectively. The Company is taking steps toward remediation during the 2024 fiscal year, but still\ncannot ensure our internal controls environment will be free of material weaknesses by the end of fiscal\nyear 2024.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND REMEDIATION\nAs described above under Remediation Efforts to Address the Material Weaknesses”, we are taking actions\nto remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes\nin our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company’s related parties include:\nRelated Party Nature of relationship\nA10 Group A10 Group is composed of:\n(a) A10 Investimentos Ltda.;\n(b) A10 Finanças e Capital Ltda.

Classification is unaffected by the entity’s expectations or events after the reporting date (e.g. the\nreceipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant).\nCovenants of loan arrangements will not affect classification of a liability as current or non-current at the\nreporting date if the entity must only comply with the covenants after the reporting date. However, if the\nentity must comply with a covenant either before or at the reporting date, this will affect the classification\nas current or non-current even if the covenant is only tested for compliance after the reporting date.\nThe amendments require disclosures if an entity classifies a liability as non-current and that liability is\nsubject to covenants that the entity must comply with within 12 months of the reporting date. The\ndisclosures include:\n• the carrying amount of the liability,\n• information about the covenants, and\n| 34\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\n• facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate that the entity may have difficulty complying with the\ncovenants.\nThe amendments also clarify what IAS 1 means when it refers to the ‘settlement’ of a liability. Terms of a\nliability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the transfer of the entity’s\nown equity instrument can only be ignored for the purpose of classifying the liability as current or non-\ncurrent if the entity classifies the option as an equity instrument. However, conversion options that are\nclassified as a liability must be considered when determining the current/non-current classification of a\nconvertible note. The amendments must be applied retrospectively in accordance with the normal\nrequirements in IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Special\ntransitional rules apply if an entity had early adopted the 2020 amendments regarding the classification of\nliabilities as current or non-current. There were no financial effects of adoption of this Standard.\n.\n• Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback – Amendments to IFRS 16\nIn September 2022, the IASB finalized narrow-scope amendments to the requirements for sale and\nleaseback transactions in IFRS 16 Leases which explain how an entity accounts for a sale and leaseback\nafter the date of the transaction.\nThe amendments specify that, in measuring the lease liability subsequent to the sale and leaseback, the\nseller-lessee determines ‘lease payments’ and ‘revised lease payments’ in a way that does not result in\nthe seller-lessee recognizing any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use that it retains.\nThis could particularly impact sale and leaseback transactions where the lease payments include variable\npayments that do not depend on an index or a rate. There were no financial effects of adoption of this\nStandard.\n• Supplier finance arrangements – Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7\nThe IASB has issued new disclosure requirements about supplier financing arrangements (‘SFAs’), after\nfeedback to an IFRS Interpretations Committee agenda decision highlighted that the information required\nby IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures falls short of meeting\nuser information needs.\nThe objective of the new disclosures is to provide information about SFAs that enables investors to assess\nthe effects on an entity’s liabilities, cash flows and the exposure to liquidity risk. The new disclosures\ninclude information about the following:\nThe terms and conditions of SFAs.\na) The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are part of SFAs and the line items in which those\nliabilities are presented.\nb) The carrying amount of the financial liabilities in (b) for which suppliers have already received payment\nfrom the finance providers.\nc) The range of payment due dates for both the financial liabilities that are part of SFAs, and comparable\ntrade payables that are not part of such arrangements.\nd) Non-cash changes in the carrying amounts of financial liabilities in(b).\ne) Access to SFA facilities and concentration of liquidity risk with finance providers.\nThe IASB has provided transitional relief by not requiring comparative information in the first year, and\nalso not requiring disclosure of specified opening balances. Further, the required disclosures are only\napplicable for annual periods during the first year of application. Therefore, the earliest that the new\ndisclosures will have to be provided is in annual financial reports for December 2024 year-ends, unless\nan entity has a financial year of less than 12 months. There were no financial effects of adoption of this\nStandard.\nStandards issued in 2024\n| 35\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\n• Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements – IFRS 18\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued new requirements for the presentation\nand disclosure of information in general purpose financial statements to ensure they provide relevant and\nfaithful representations of an entity's assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses. The objective is to\noffer financial information that helps users assess the prospects for future net cash inflows and evaluate\nmanagement’s stewardship of the entity’s economic resources.\nThese financial statements comply with IFRS Accounting Standards, adhering to both general and specific\nrequirements for presenting information in the statement of financial performance, the statement of\nfinancial position, and the statement of changes in equity. The requirements include aggregation and\ndisaggregation of information to ensure clarity, a comprehensive statement of profit or loss, and the\npresentation of totals and subtotals for key financial metrics. This standard, issued in April 2024, is effective\nfor annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe Company is subject to numerous risk factors at any given time (many of which are beyond its control) which\ncould materially adversely impact upon its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to\nobtain financing and prospects and, as a result, the trading price of the Common Shares. For risk factors faced by\nSigma, please refer to its Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the section titled\n“Risk Factors” filed on the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca and EDGAR at www.sec.gov, as\nrevised or supplemented as follows:\nRisks Related to Resource Development\n▪ Development of the Company: The Company’s business strategy depends in large part on maintaining\nthe Company as a commercially viable mining operation. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially\nviable depends on numerous factors, including: (i) the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size,\ngrade and proximity to infrastructure; (ii) commodity prices, which are highly volatile; and (iii) government\nregulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and\nexporting of minerals, environmental protection and capital and operating cost requirements. The\ncontinuous development and operation of the Company is subject to the Company securing the necessary\nfunding and other resources and is also subject to numerous development and operational risks.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain as a commercial mining\noperation.\n▪ Achieving and managing growth: The Company began its operations in the third quarter of 2023 and\nhas faced a substantial increase in skilled personnel and operational support as it transitions to a more\nconsolidated operating stage. The Company’s ability to succeed in its commercial operations depends on\na number of factors, including management’s ability to manage this transition, the availability of working\ncapital, and the ability to recruit and train additional qualified personnel (and, where appropriate, to engage\nthird party contractors with qualified personnel).\nRisks Related to the Company’s Business and Securities\n▪ Risks of future losses and going concern: The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is\ndependent upon the ability to ultimately generate future profitable operations and obtain the necessary\nfinancing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when\nthey come due. The Company has reported net losses and comprehensive losses for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company had a cash balance of $88.6 million as of September 30,\n2024 and believes it will be capable of generating more cash from its operations and considers it will\ncontinue as a going concern at least for the next twelve months. The Company’s business does not\ncurrently operate on a self-sustaining basis and until it is successfully able to fund its expenditures from\nits revenues, its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on obtaining additional debt financing\nto fund long-term expenditures related to the construction of the forthcoming Phase 2 Greentech Plant.\n| 36\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\n▪ Significant shareholder influence: To the Company’s knowledge, as of the date hereof, A10\nInvestimentos Fundo de Investimento de Ações - Investimento No Exterior (“A10 Fund”) holds\napproximately 43.01% of the outstanding Common Shares. For as long as it directly or indirectly maintains\na significant interest in the Company, A10 Fund may be in a position to affect the Company’s governance\nand operations. As a result of its shareholdings, A10 Fund has the ability, among other things, to approve\nsignificant corporate transactions and delay or prevent a change of control of the Company that could\notherwise be beneficial to minority shareholders. A10 Fund generally will have the ability to control the\noutcome of any matter submitted for the vote or consent of the Company’s shareholders. In some cases,\nthe interests of A10 Fund may not be the same as those of the other minority shareholders, and conflicts\nof interest may arise from time to time that may be resolved in a manner detrimental to the Company or\nminority shareholders (including conflicts of interests that result from certain officers and directors being\ninvolved with the A10 Fund). The effect of this influence may be to limit the price that investors are willing\nto pay for Common Shares.\nIn addition, the potential that A10 Fund may sell Common Shares in the public market or in private\ntransactions, as well as any actual sales of Common Shares in the public market or in private transactions,\ncould adversely affect the market price of the Common Shares.\nRisks Related to cyber-security\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with its information technology systems and cyber-security, such as\nthe misappropriation of the Company’s confidential information noted above, the disclosure of which could have\nan adverse effect on the Company.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates about the\nfuture that affect the application of the Company’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nJudgements\nJudgements are made in relation to the application of accounting policies that have significant effects on the\namounts recognized in the financial statements as well as the extent and significance of the disclosure given,\nwhether the circumstances affecting the Company has been adequately considered when preparing the financial\nstatements. The judgement considered in the financial statements is the classification as non-current liability of\nthe long-term export prepayment agreement repayable by December 2026 since the amortization of principal is\ndependent upon the sum of net cash from operating and investing activities.\nEstimates\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are consistent with the Company’s\nrisk management and commitments where appropriate. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively.\nThe areas which require management to make significant judgements, estimates and assumptions in determining\ncarrying amounts include, but are not limited to:\nMeasurement of stock-based payment transactions: The valuation of the Company’s stock-based payment\ntransactions requires the use of estimates and valuation techniques. Measurement of the Company’s restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) that contain market-based conditions is based on a Monte Carlo pricing model which uses\nvarious inputs and assumptions. Changes in these assumptions result in changes in the fair value of these\ninstruments and a corresponding change in the amount recognized in profit or loss. Judgment is also required in\ndetermining grant date and in estimating when non-market performance conditions are expected to be met.\nMineral reserves and mineral resources: Proven and probable mineral reserves of the Company are those\nmeasured and indicated mineral resources demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study and commercial\n| 37\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\nviability. The Company estimates its proven and probable mineral reserves and measured, indicated and inferred\nmineral resources based on the work done and compiled by qualified persons. The estimation of future cash flows\nrelated to proven and probable mineral reserves is based upon factors such as estimates of commodity prices,\nforeign exchange rates, future capital requirements and production costs along with geological assumptions and\njudgements made in estimating the size and grade of the mineral ore body. Changes in the proven and probable\nmineral reserves or measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources estimates may impact the carrying amount\nof the property, plant and equipment, asset retirement obligations, recognition of deferred tax amounts and\ndepreciation and depletion.\nAssets retirement obligation: The Company assesses its provision for assets retirement obligation on an annual\nbasis or when new material information becomes available. Mining and exploration activities are subject to various\nlaws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. In general, these laws and regulations are\ncontinually changing, and the Company has made, and intends to make in the future, expenditures to comply with\nsuch laws and regulations. Accounting for restoration, rehabilitation, and environmental remediation obligations\nrequires management to make estimates of the future costs the Company will incur to complete the restoration,\nrehabilitation, and environmental remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations at each\nmining operation. Actual costs incurred may differ from those amounts estimated. Also, future changes to\nenvironmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of restoration, rehabilitation, and environmental\nremediation work required to be performed by the Company. Increase in future costs could materially impact the\namounts charged to operations for restoration, rehabilitation, and environmental remediation. The provision\nrepresents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future restoration, rehabilitation, and\nenvironmental remediation obligation. The actual future expenditures may differ from the amounts currently\nprovided.\nImpairment of non-financial assets: Significant judgments, estimates and assumptions are required to\ndetermine whether an impairment trigger event has occurred and to prepare the Company’s cash flows.\nManagement uses the budgets approved as a starting point and key assumptions are, but not limited to: (i) mineral\nreserves and mineral resources measured by internal experts; (ii) costs and investments based on the best\nestimate of projects; (iii) sale prices consistent with projections available in reports published by industry\nconsidering the market price when appropriate; (iv) the useful life of the Company’s cash generating unit; and (v)\ndiscount rates that reflect specific risks relating to the relevant assets in the cash-generating unit. These\nassumptions are susceptible to risks and uncertainties and may change the Company’s projection and, therefore,\nmay affect the recoverable value of assets.\nProvisional pricing adjustments: The Company’s products may be provisionally priced at the date revenue is\nrecognized and a provisional invoice issued. Provisionally priced receivables are subsequently measured at fair\nvalue through profit and loss under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”. The final selling price for all provisionally priced\nproducts is based on the estimated price for the quotational period stipulated in the contracts. Final prices are\nnormally determined after delivery to the customer. The change in value of the provisionally priced receivable is\nbased on relevant forward market prices and is included in sales revenue. For contracts with variable pricing\ndependent on the content of mineral in the product delivered, the Company estimates the amount of consideration\nto which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the products.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of the date of this MD&A, the Company does not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are\nreasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the financial performance or financial condition of the\nCompany, including, and without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital resources.\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nThe Company manages its capital with the following objectives:\n| 38\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\n▪ To ensure sufficient financial flexibility to achieve its ongoing business objectives, namely funding future\ngrowth opportunities (including potential production expansions through the development of the Project’s\nPhase 2 and Phase 3 deposits); and\n▪ To maximize shareholder returns through enhancing its share value, the Company monitors its capital\nstructure and adjusts according to market conditions to meet its objectives, given the current outlook of\nthe business and industry in general. The Company may manage its capital structure by issuing new\nshares, raising debt, repurchasing outstanding shares, adjusting capital spending, or disposing of assets.\nThe capital structure is reviewed by management and the Board on an ongoing basis.\nThe Company’s shareholders’ equity is comprised of share capital, stock-based compensation reserve, other\ncomprehensive income (loss) and accumulated losses, which on September 30, 2024 totaled $147.9 million\n(December 31, 2023: $214.3 million). The Company’s capital management objectives, policies, and processes\nremained unchanged during the three-month period ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company manages capital through its financial and operational forecasting processes. The Company reviews\nits operating expenditures and other investing and financing initiatives based on its activities.\nFINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks such as credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including\ninterest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price risk.\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, export prepayment trade finance and credits from\nrelated parties approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.\nCredit Risk\nThe credit risk management policy aims to minimize the possibility of not receiving sales made and amounts\ninvested, deposited or guaranteed by financial institutions and counterparties, through analysis, granting and\nmanagement of credits, using quantitative and qualitative parameters.\nThe Company manages its credit risk by receiving in advance a substantial portion of its sales or by letters of\ncredit.\nCredit granted to financial institutions is used to accept guarantees and invest cash surpluses.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The\nCompany’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due.\nThe Company’s management of cash is focused on funding ongoing capital needs for operating the Greentech\nPlant, developing the Company’s growth opportunities (including Phase 2) and for general corporate expenditures.\nManagement intends to use cash generated by its operating activities to meet its obligations. To the extent the\nCompany does not believe it has sufficient liquidity to meet obligations, it will consider securing additional equity\nor debt funding.\nThe Company continuously monitors its cash outflows and seeks opportunities to minimize all costs, to the extent\npossible, as well as its general and administrative expenses.\nThe following table shows the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest:\nContractual obligations Up to 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years Total\n| 39\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\nMore than 5\n(in C$ 000s) years\nSuppliers 47,645 - - - 47,645\nAccounts payable 9,951 - - - 9,951\nLoans and export prepayment 108,597 138,481 9,517 8,072 264,667\nLease liabilities 1,658 1,676 708 564 4,606\nMarket Risk\nProvisional pricing adjustments – The Company’s products may be provisionally priced at the date revenue is\nrecognized and a provisional invoice issued. Provisionally priced receivables are subsequently measured at fair\nvalue through profit and loss under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”. The final selling price for all provisionally priced\nproducts is based on the estimated price for the quotational period stipulated in the contracts. The change in value\nof the provisionally priced receivable is based on relevant market prices and is included in sales revenue. For\ncontracts with variable pricing dependent on the content of mineral in the product delivered, the Company\nestimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the products.\nThe sensitivity of the Company’s risk related to the final settlement of provisional pricing accounts receivable\nexpected to be determined for the shipments outstanding on September 30, 2024 is detailed below:\nProvisional Effect on\nSales Revenue\nVolume (kt)(3) price Variation\n(CAD)\nHigh grade lithium concentrate USD 757/ (USD 52)/\n74,753 (5,300)\n(Probable)(1) $1,022 ($ 71)\nHigh grade lithium concentrate USD 809/ USD 162/\n74,753 16,346\n(+20%)(2) $1,093 $219\nHigh grade lithium concentrate (- USD 809)/ (USD 162)/\n74,753 (16,346)\n20%)(2) $1,093 $(219)\n(1) The sensitivity analysis of the probable scenario was measured using October 31, 2024, futures price from the Guangzhou Futures\nExchange as a reference, with an exchange rate of USD 1.00 to $1.3514.\n(2) Provisional price on September 30, 2024.\n(3) Total volume of contracts with exposure to market price fluctuation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThis risk arises from short- and long-term financial investments, financing and export prepayment linked to fixed\nand floating interest rates of the CDI, Selic and BSBY, exposing these financial assets and liabilities to interest rate\nfluctuations as shown in the sensitivity analysis framework.\nThe Company considered probable scenarios 1 and 2 of changes in interest rates volatility as of September 30,\n2024.\nThe interest rates used in the sensitivity analysis in their respective scenarios are shown below together with the\neffects on the profit and loss balances for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024:\nProbable\nNotional scenario (1) Scenario 1 Scenario 2\nAssets\nRate 10.65% p.a 10.65% p.a 9.59% p.a 8.52% p.a\nShort-term investments CDI (-10% and -20%) 829 42 38 34\n| 40\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\n(Expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts or unless stated otherwise)\nProbable\nNotional scenario (1) Scenario 1 Scenario 2\nLiabilities\nRate 10.65% p.a 10.65% p.a 11.72% p.a 12.78% p.a\nBDMG Selic (+10% and +20%) 21,614 (1,106) (1,217) (1,327)\nRate 5.04% p.a 5.04% p.a 5.16% p.a 5.29% p.a\nExport prepayment BSBY (+2,5% and\n132,050 (3,239) (3,319) (3,485)\nagreement +5,0%)\n(1) Sensitivity analysis of the scenario probable was measured using as reference the rates on October 15, 2024.\nIn the second quarter, the Company entered into swap operations with the objective of exchanging the interest\nexposure of an advance on foreign exchange contract calculated in USD, which are originally calculated on the\nnotional amount in USD, to DI plus an interest rate calculated on the notional amount in BRL.

position to affect the Company’s governance, operations and the market price of the\nCommon Shares.\n▪ As the Company is a Canadian corporation but many of its directors and officers are not citizens

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2024 earnings\nconference call. On the call with me today are company's CEO and Co-Chairperson, Ana Cabral; and CFO,\nRogerio Marchini. Earlier this morning, we published our 3Q press release and posted our financial results,\nwhich are available through both SEC and SEDAR. Before we begin, I'd like to cover 2 items. First, during\nthe presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations.\nWe note that actual events or results could differ materially from changes in market conditions in our\noperations. And additionally, earnings referenced in this presentation may exclude certain noncore and\nnonrecurring items. Reconciliations to the most comparable IFRS financial measures and other associated\ndisclosures, including descriptions of adjustments can be found in the back of the release.\nWith that, I will pass the call over to Ana. Ana?\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nGood morning, everyone. Well, this quarter, we achieved a production in low industry cost targets. We\ngenerated robust free cash flow, and we demonstrated our operational resilience to lithium cycles. We\nalso benefited from a shift in our commercial strategy, which helped us navigate industry seasonality and\nprice volatility, enabling us to secure final higher average realized prices compared to the price bulleting\nbenchmarks.\nOver the last year, you followed us on this journey, and we are very proud to have transformed Sigma\nfrom an margin producer into this industry leader, demonstrating the operational and financial resilience of\na mature producer showing dependability and consistency. Meanwhile, we have managed to deliver all of\nour climates, and we reached net zero one year in advance of our target, 27 years ahead of the industry\nwith our into Triple Zero Green Lithium, which became a brand.\nWell, we're very confident that over the lithium cycles, our capabilities to deliver on the execution of our\nstrategy will ensure long-term value for Sigma in all of its stakeholders. So without further ado, I will\ninitiate this presentation going through the highlights of our quarter.\nWell, on the operational aspect of our operations, we continue to deliver operational excellence. We\nfirst further increased the cadence of quasi monthly volumes to 22,000 tonnes sold per month. We also\nmanaged to surpass third quarter production targets set initially at 60,000 tonnes, we've done better than\nour targets. We successfully executed a shift in commercial strategy that helped us weather seasonality,\nmeaning we achieved higher realized prices versus the industry and increased substantially our resilience\nto lithium cycles.\nMore importantly, we keep on working on our Greentech plan technology perfecting it. We successfully\nconcluded the Plant 1 efficiency revamp we talked about in our Investor Day, which has the potential\nto increase production by 10% to 15% just like we said. More importantly, we continue to advance\nthe construction of the second plant, and we're going to show you quite a lot of pictures here of our\nconstruction side.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nI think more importantly to all of us partner employees, we created this culture of ownership and\noperational excellence, which continue to deliver in the 0 accidents with our lost time achievement. We've\ngone out 43 days without accidents, without lost time to work and 0 fatalities, staying at the very top of\nthe ICMM rankings.\nI'll pass it on now to Rogerio, our CFO.\nRogerio Marchini\nCFO & Executive VP of Corporate Finance\nGood morning, all. So Sigma delivered robust financial performance. The principal financial highlights that\nwe have in Q3, we signed the BNDES Development loan agreement, fully funded construction of Phase 2.\nWe maintained low CIF cash cost at target $513 per tonne, lowest [indiscernible] industry, $34.5 million in\ngenerated operational cash flow, [indiscernible] million cash in the bank, continue to lower interest rate of\nexport credit rate lines something around 9%.\nSo we will [indiscernible] execution deliver operational performance on targets. Production volumes 6,237\nGLT, sales volume, 57,483 GLT, cash costs 449 per tonne, CIF in China 413 per tonne; sales revenue $44.2\nmillion; operational cash flow $34.5 million; cash in the bank $65.7 million; provisional price adjustment\n$23.3 million. This provision of price adjustments is final account settlement of sale open invoice. And we\ncreate -- we had a cash gross margin of 38%.\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nI'll talk a bit about the superior industrial performance of our Greentech industrial plan. So on production,\nwe delivered on very, very ambitious targets. The strong performance of the plant basically achieved\nresults that were never before achieved in DMS. Basically, it is a result of our unique Greentech\ntechnology. So we delivered production above targets of 60,237 dry metric tonnes. We achieved plant\nDMS recoveries of 70%, which is a record for this type of technology in lithium. And we achieved global\nrecoveries of 55%, demonstrating what we're going to say next. By concluding the optimization project\nin record time, we are going to boost global recoveries to near the levels of DMS recoveries by increasing\nthis plant efficiency in this quarter and in all the quarters thereafter.\nMore importantly, this is going to allow us -- these changes are going to allow us to reprocess our tailings\nbasically or upcycling [indiscernible] contained in the tailings into more lithium concentrate. Now in a clear\ndemonstration of operational readiness, our team managed to execute the shutdown in only 4 days and\nimplemented and installed all the equipment necessary for this optimization project. So the team is very\nready to build Plant 2.\nNow I would highlight here something that sometimes we missed. We use a different technology than the\nrest of the industry. We use dense media separation versus flotation. For many reasons, environmentally,\nour technology together with the dry stacking doesn't create a tailings dam. Also importantly, for our other\nstakeholders, for our shareholders, these technologies will allow us in great part to achieve some of the\nlowest cost in the industry as a result of the more -- the simplicity of the processing of lithium that takes\nplace in a DMS. So demonstrating that, when we saw total production cost at [indiscernible] at $395 a\ntonne, only $113 a tonne come from the processing DMS costs.\nIn fact, I want to use this point here to highlight another cost savings that will take place in the next\nquarter. We installed mobile crushers as part of this optimization project, which are temporary costs. So\n$25 a tonne are going to drop from this cost in the next quarter. So in the next slide is the demonstration\nof that operational performance. So we were able then to resume our trajectory of increasing production\nlevels.\nSo the increased production performance has also translated into higher sales volumes for the company\nas you can see here, over the last 5 quarters and when you look at the last 4 quarters, you have then our\nannualized sales volumes. We are expecting to be able to continue on this trend and sell 60,000 tonnes\nin the fourth quarter of this year. As we said, this culture -- the strong culture of safety and processes is\nwhat drives this operational excellence.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nI mean, our team works motivated, knowing that we have the processes and the safety culture to allow\nthem to return to their families safely every day. So again, we continued on our trend of 0 fatalities, 443\ndays without lost time to accidents or injuries achieving a TRIFR, which is the index through which we\ncalculate this of 1.24, which is the second lowest in all of the ICMM rankings, among all of the global\nmetals and mining companies, some of them much bigger than ours.\nRogerio Marchini\nCFO & Executive VP of Corporate Finance\nSo talking about BNDES. As I mentioned, we signed BNDES low on transaction. This is a very fantastic\ntarget that we got. The total amount is $487 million, that files 99% of our CapEx, the expansion on Phase\n2. The first loan disbursement is pending a bank guarantee. And this lining will reimburse CapEx spend\nsince one quarter of 2024. The terms is pretty good. The maturity is 16 years, the grace period is 18\nmonths and fixed rate, it's a really, really good rate, $2.5, and there is no requirement of collateral in\nassets. So with BNDES, we are creating a long-term partnership for developing new funds to finance our\nexpansions like to upcycling Phase III lithium intermediates and other expansions that we are planning.\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nSo with that, we got confidence to continue to plow through in advance through our Plant 2 construction.\nSo you can see the areas here, and this is kind of a different picture than what we used to show. We\nused to show in yellow the plant and then in green the infrastructure. So now we kind of switched over\nthe area so that you can see the whole construction area to the left of the plant going all the way in\nsomething around 2 to 3 square kilometers a year within our already licensed environmental areas. So\nwe're executing earthworks and engineering according to plan exactly as planned.\nWell, moving on to cost targets. Again, we delivered on all of our cost targets as always, mainly this is\nbecause we have a very strict cost discipline here at Sigma. So we just maintained what we've always\ndone. And therefore, we remain as one of the lowest cash costs in the whole industry. So this -- actually\nthese systems and [indiscernible] and consistency and discipline in maintaining low cost is what actually\ndemonstrates how resilient our company is to all the lithium cycles. We are always going to be in the\nblack. Now more importantly, that execution discipline of keeping a little of our cost and maintaining low\ncost levels generated positive cash flow in the third quarter. So again, we are weathering the floor, which\nhappened in the third quarter of the lithium cycles, which has been another data point.\nI mean, this -- a positive cash flow generation is not a data point about the resilience of our business. So\nas you can see in these 4 charts, the operational cash flow generated, which was USD 34.5 million, all the\nfigures here are in U.S. dollars, enable us to continue on delivering these earthworks and construction\nfor Phase 2 CapEx investments, which amounted to $5 million in the quarter. But more importantly, it will\nallow us to repay some of the existing credit debit lines because given the BNDES was signed and final,\nwe have now the confidence of not having to maintain such a large cash balance, given that we're not\nplanning to fund this construction with trade credit lines anymore, even though those trade payer lines are\nkind of cheap.\nSo we retired USD 40 million in export credit debt, again, in a clear sign of cash flow generation and\nfinancial resilience. All the while, though, we still managed to maintain a very healthy cash balance during\nthe year. So just for comparison purposes, we show the cash balance in December and then the cash\nbalance in September at the end of the third quarter.\nNow this page basically it's a very important page because in the quarter, we managed to further adapt\nour commercial strategy. So we pivoted from selling to the trader as a principle to sell into the trader\nas a distributor. So again, another data point that enabled us to weather the lithium market seasonality\nsignificantly strengthening our commercial position.\nAnd this is quantifiable. How so? First graphically, intuitively in a chart at the bottom, the light gray line\nshows the benchmark, fastmarkets spodumene index, right? These are bulletin price index since the\nbeginning of the year. And then in the fin bars here, you can see where we priced our boats with which\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\neach shipment. So you can see that by June, as we switched and adapted our commercial strategy, we\nstarted to manage to price our boats above the bulletin fastmarket prices. And we sent we consistently\ncontinue to achieve that throughout August.\nThen we were able to push back the final resale of the product by the traders distributed all the way to\nthe seasonality in October, concentrating these purchases seasonally and again, managing to price our\nboats above the benchmark price. Now in the chart above, you can see that in percentages and how these\ncontrasts to what happened, for example, during the winter seasonality and then the pickup in prices in\nthe spring. The change is quantifiable.\nIn the weaker seasonality, we were 25% below the benchmark index because we didn't pick up that\nseasonality as we were basically selling to the trader and the trader was the principal. He had full\ndiscretion on the resale. Now in the summer seasonality, the situation changed completely because\nseasonality is typically that sort of fluctuation, 25%-ish, 30%, right -- 20% to 25%, we inverted it. So\nwe picked up all the above benchmark pricing seasonality. We reached 119% of the benchmark price\nseasonality, meaning capturing more value for our business. Now this change is quantifiable also in the\nmark-to-market closing of some of these previous trades that we did in this quarter. So as a result of\nthese changes in commercial strategy, we also changed the way our commercial relationship with traders\nis conducted.\nSo essentially, we concluded this final accounting is a no-cash settlement of sales invoices from the\nprevious quarters just turning a page on a way to do business that we no longer engage in given the\nrobustness of our position today. Now this is important to understand our financial statements because\nwhen you look at the sales revenues booked, they have a provisional price adjustment which is essentially\nthe closeout of all of these trades.\nFor this quarter, we just have a residual value of USD 7.7 million from the trades shipped in the fourth\nquarter of last year and that arrived this year. And then we have $15.6 million from the trades shipped\nand arrived this year. But now when you look at the year-to-date, that's when you see how most of the\noverall effect of all of these provisional prices that we've been booking and marking our sales book to\nmarket throughout the year are concentrated in the boats, the ships, the boats that were shipped in the\nfourth quarter of last year. So it's a clear heavy function of how the fluctuations actually and how the\nsignificant decrease in lithium prices in the fourth quarter actually caused this mark-to-market of our open\nsales books and therefore, lead to about $20 million of the overall annual provisional price adjustment\nover $29 million of the total.\nWe can clearly see a concentration in the fourth quarter of 2023. But that basically concludes the way of\ndoing business that way, as you can see in how we are managing our commercial strategy in the present\nand going forward. Another data point on that is that this commercial assertiveness resulted in higher\nfinancial prices achieved in the third quarter. So you can clearly see it and you can basically calculate this\nback to our financials. Then in the third quarter, because we managed to concentrate our resales through\nthe traders and distributors post the winter seasonality in the fall of restocking cycles, we managed to\nachieve higher realized prices, actually. If you think about it just this week, we were managing to get\npricing indications for $900 for the October ship. Had we priced that boat when we shipped it, it would\nhave been $750, which was the bulleting price.\nSo it's, again, bigger point that indicate that we have made the perfect pivot in our commercial strategy\nby increasing the control of our resales or [indiscernible]. But again, this was just enabled by the cadence,\nthe performance of our business, which drove us to obtain higher -- larger trade finance credit lines and\ntherefore, managed to have this sort of commercial control over our trading partners.\nThis slide is a bit of a more detailed, but it's important because we talked about the cash generation. So\nwe want to dissect a bit how the cash position floated from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the\nquarter. So the first element here is that the sales revenue for the quarter before the nonprovisional price\nadjustments basically brought a positive inflow of USD 45 million. Then we had a working capital increase\nhere of $56 million. But then within that, there was a portion from the collection of account receivables\nfrom the previous quarter. So netting it out, we ended up with a $32 positive $1 million, right?\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nAn interesting item that generated quite a lot of questions in the previous quarter, but we're\ndemonstrating here now that it was basically mark-to-market of currency. We just had a small foreign\nexchange fluctuation. And again, it results from the Brazilian real volatility given that our costs are in\nBrazilian reals, our revenues are in dollars and so the small volatility. In fact, here, the currency is our ally\nbecause we have dollar revenues and we have emerging market currency denominated costs, right? And I\nthink lastly, you can see that this robust operational cash flow generated allow us to basically retire drawn\nbut non-use trade credit finance debt.\nSo we just repaid $40 million in trade credit finance debt. And again, going back to what Rogerio was\nsaying, this is because now we have the confidence that the MDS is signed, binding done. So essentially,\nwe will need to keep this large cash balance from drawn trade lines in order to fund our construction in\nthe next 12 months. Again, this is another slide just to reinforce our comfortable liquidity position. So you\ncan see our cash position at USD 65.6 million. Again, all numbers in this presentation are U.S. dollars. And\nthen when you look at the short-term debt, it offsets this USD 59.2 million, which are current short-term\ntrade lines, which are still in our balance sheet and we're actually gradually lowering that number as we\nadvance towards the first disbursement with BNDES. .\nThere's $10.8 million here, which refer to the short portion of the long-term debt with Synergy Capital,\none of our shareholders, which you can see here in the long term that portion of the slide. More\nimportantly, on this slide, it demonstrates that we have robust access to liquidity at improved interest\nrates which result from this consistent operational performance. So essentially, as for trade credit lines,\nour deliver and assessed and evaluated by banks based on performance risk. Performance risk is the\nability of the company to produce, sell, deliver the product, exporting every single month.\nNow as you've seen, our production in sales cadence now over 5 quarters, over a year, basically, more\nthan a year, has basically allowed us to have this robust access to export credit line facilities at much\nimproved interest rates because of this consistent operational performance. So at the bottom here, we\nactually break down our interest rate cost by type of that facility.\nSo you can see that our export credit lines with Banco do Brasil, Shanghai, one of our biggest export\ntrade partners, actually, the biggest at for trade partner is 5.5% in U.S. dollars fixed and that's incredibly\nattractive. The overall trade finance in the domestic Brazilian market, it's sitting at 9%, which again is a\nsubstantial decrease from the 15% where it used to be just at the beginning of this year when we haven't\nyet established this 1-year long operational performance cadence.\nJust to recap, the BNDES debt sits at a very comfortable 2.5% fixed in dollars and then our current long-\nterm debt with the Synergy Capital , our very esteemed shareholder sits at 12.3% for that current long-\nterm debt, which, again, is an extremely benign facility, and we're very grateful for Synergy Capital for\nhaving delivered as this vote of confidence in December 2022 in order to commission our front line.\nAnd again, speaking of that, where are we headed? We're going to continue to deliver on our strategy.\nI mean, again, we are low cost. We're generating operational cash flow. We managed to adjust our\ncommercial strategies to navigate lithium cycle. So we are going to deliver on a strategy to increase\nproduction capacity again.\nAnd so a quick recap here. We are expecting to reach 100,000 tonnes per year of LCE equivalent\nproduction capacity by the end of '26. And here, we kind of break it down in blocks how we're going to get\nthere. More importantly, we are going to build 20,000 tonnes equivalent of LCE, of concentration capability\nto fully back integrate into a potential lithium sulphate chemical plant. This is a key part of our strategy. If\nanything, because we'll be executing the metallurgical reduction of our own premium lithium concentrate.\nSo we're going to bank on our own metallurgical premium pricing for our shareholders, which is in the\norder of 20% to 30%.\nSo looking at this page, so where are we? We're here entering 2025. This is where we are headed. We are\ncompleting -- we're executing the plant to construction. So that -- the capacity there in LCE equivalent is\nshown in 34,000 tonnes. Then we have the Phase 1, which is delivering a 37,000 tonnes equivalent. Now\nwe continue on this construction project, and we have more pictures from the book posted online to show\nyou that we've really cleared the area to prepare for earthworks throughout.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nSo basically, we'll clear it for the Phase III as well, which will be essentially approximately 35,000 tonnes\nout of the 54,000 tonnes over here. It's important to notice that, that's not yet funded. So the blue are\nthe portions that are not yet funded. So when we look at the overall, when you look at the full-on capacity\nincrease here, we see that we're going to have 105,000 tonnes of lithium concentrate capacity. And then\nwe're going to -- we plan to have 20,000 tonnes of integrated chemical lithium sulphate capacity by 2027.\nSo this is sort of how we set out our strategy, and we are going to execute in the typical prudent and\nconservative way that we've always done. And this is what enabled us to deliver on these industrial\nfacilities on budget and on target. And more importantly, with a financing structure that is conducive to\nthe company's cash generation and repayment capability. So that discipline is what enabled us to get here,\nand that discipline is what will enable us to get there.\nSo my closing comments. So over the year, we transformed Sigma. We're very proud of what we built\nbecause we transformed Sigma, and we placed this company as a leading global lithium producer. More\nimportantly, we demonstrated that we're one of the most resilient lithium companies to all the cycles. That\nis the result of the operational discipline, the low cost and obviously, the industrial prowess to allow us to\ndeliver this on a large scale.\nWe have a phenomenal team. We got [indiscernible] on the line. We have all of our technical general\nmanagers sitting on site. So we're very, very proud of the commitment of our team. Just recapping\nwhat we've done in 9 months out of this year. Essentially, we achieved the financial independent. So\nwe managed to basically adapt and strengthen our commercial strategy. We signed this transformative\ndevelopment bank loan with BNDES, building what we believe to be a lifelong partnership of progress\nin the lithium industry in Brazil together with BNDES. Then we managed to declare the final investment\ndecision on Phase II and mobilize to deliver the earthworks and the construction engineering you can see\nhappening.\nAlso, last semester, we increased our mineral resources by 40%. So demonstrating that we got an ample\nreservoir of mineral resources and mineral reserves to deliver on the production capacity targets we just\noutlined on the previous page. Again, we began Phase II construction and achieved the cost guidance we\nset out at the beginning of the year in one of the first conferences.\nAnd we surprised the market in our ability to be disciplined and to get there given that at the time, our\nfinancials were still cluttered from the commissioning expenses. So what's next? Well, it's going to be\nboring now. We're going to be executing on time, on budget, and we're planning to have a Phase II\ncommissioning in the third -- initiate commissioning in the third quarter of 2025.\nSo with that, I close the presentation, and we move on to the Q&A. Matt, on to you.\nMatthew Porter DeYoe\nExecutive Vice President for Corporate Affairs & Strategic Development\nThanks, Anna. I think Rob, we will pass it on to Q&A. I think we have a few questions on the line, if you'd\nlike to start moving to the list.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of\nAmerica.\nStephen V. Byrne\nBofA Securities, Research Division\nI have a couple of questions really directed at your commercial team. Are they perceiving any changes\nin interest level from your converter customers in your spodumene, is that interest level changing? Are\nthey seeing increased interest? Is it flattish? Is it slipping? And is there a change here because of any\nincreased interest in your product because it has the processing benefits? Or is there a sense out there\nthat supply and demand may be inflecting here? So a question on that. And then also, how far out do you\nbook orders? Is there anything there that you can comment on for us with respect to what you think net\nrealized pricing could go to from here in this quarter or next? Is there any inflection that you're seeing?\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nNo, these are 2 very good questions. The first question is you hit the nail in the head here. As we now\nhave basically a year of data points or at the time we decided to make this change, we had about 6\nmonths of data points on the performance of our material with the customers. It became clear to us\nthat because we haven't been able to fully monetize the metallurgical premium of our product, our\nproduct would always sell. But not only that, it would always sell and it was seen as a source of blending\nmaterial whereas a source of gross margin by the towing and the downstreamers that engage in towing\narrangements because that debt metallurgical premium is actually enabling a 20% to 30% cost savings to\nthe customers, which were not priced in the product.\nSo we had that confidence that we would always be able to sell our entire cargo loads. With that\nconfidence, we were able -- we decided to switch into, what we call, the traders distributor commercial\npolicy strategy. Why? Because that is how we managed to navigate the seasonality by essentially\norganizing with the trader to resell the product just after seasonality, which ties back to your second\nquestion.\nWe kept on taking orders in the order book throughout the year. And this is sort of how we get our own\ndata points on the ground of the switch in sentiment from the other element that is there, which is a\npickup in demand in China given the initial results of the stimulus in the new energy vehicle industries.\nAnd the auto sales increase of 44% in September showed that. So by collecting orders throughout the\ndown cycle of the low of the summer and then entering in the fall and then throughout the fall, we were\nable to ascertain what was the changing sentiment directed at? And that's very easily triangulated with\nthe GFEX and therefore, execute all the trade extremely well, basically at once almost like within very few\ndays of spacing out throughout some of those weeks in October.\nNow the second part of your question is also very important because as we were entering, we can't time\nthe market perfectly, obviously, but as we were just entering the period of restocking the seasonality, the\nbenchmark was showing 750, but we were able to collect orders and book trades at 820, 800. So a $70\nper tonne difference to benchmark, which is sizable, right? But then more interestingly, as we held back\nour -- the traders distributor was able to hold back part of the resale of the October cargo just now this\nweek, we've seen data points of $920. And again, now we're learning that this it is very easily triangulated\nwith the GFEX. So this ability to actually navigate the seasonality, meaning contrast that to us selling\nthese shipments on the water throughout the summer low cycle, we probably would have had shipments\npriced at $700 which were some of these benchmark indices showing at the time.\nSo -- and we unfortunately experienced that pain earlier in the year because our trader was the principle.\nSo we didn't have the ability to co-control final resale decisions that come with the relationship change\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\ninto traders distributors. So we're very proud of what we achieved. But again, it took us a month -- it took\nus a few months of being actively in the market, having our commercial team, we have commercial people\nin China now to be able to gather what we believe is a pretty good reading of the market dynamics in\nAsia.\nStephen V. Byrne\nBofA Securities, Research Division\nAnd Ana, maybe just one follow-up on that. With some shuttered capacity in Australia recently, are you\nholding back again? Or are you perceiving any increased interest in buying from your customers?\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nWell, I think there's a deeper issue behind this. And that's related to traceability, lithium source from\nartisanal mining, illegal lithium and all that we've been watching in the market this year. As we all know,\nthe volume of the shuttered capacity wasn't meaningful to actually have a real effect in the market. It had\na psychological effect in the market because it kind of demonstrated that some of the mines in higher-cost\njurisdictions are not economic at current lithium prices. But that leads to the question of who is economic\nin current lithium prices. And essentially, when you run the math, you have the 2 large-scale producers\nin Australia. They are economical because they have the scale and they're very efficient and then Latin\nAmerica and then Africa.\nBut then you examine some of the supply that comes from Africa, that's okay, it's industrial lithium, fair\ngame, excellent, lifting to people, but some of that supply is untraceable. So I think the market -- the real\nmarket dynamics we are experiencing on the ground in the industry this quarter is an increased scrutiny\nover the source of raw materials of that chemical. And some of the carmakers, they are very aligned to\nsustainability and ESG practices are actually leading that charge with their supply chain.\nSo we've been seeing joint procurement initiatives between battery makers and carmakers are clients,\nright? We see quite a lot of interesting developments. So the real development here is now there's\na spotlight in the industry, basically asking, well, do your employees wear helmets, are your minds\ntraceable, is this artisanal, are you ethically sourcing your lithium, which probably will displace a much\nlarger quantity from some of these materials mined and complete this regard to the 21st century and the\nnew era of valuing the individual and valuing human beings that we see taking place in the century.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Katie Lachapelle from Canaccord Genuity.\nKatie Lachapelle\nCanaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division\nCongrats on a good operational quarter. I do want to understand the provisional pricing adjustment a\nlittle bit more this quarter. It was quite a bit higher than what I was expecting. I noticed in the prepared\nremarks, you stated that it was related to a shipment from Q4. So I'm just trying to understand why such\na significant delay, like why was this only being reported now in Q3? And then going forward, are any of\nthese adjustments expected to continue into the fourth quarter? Or are we kind of through the worst of it\nnow?\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nNo. I mean, it's -- we closed out this open trades. And we -- this is basically an accounting closeout of the\ntrades. And essentially, you can see in the year-to-date -- yes, that's there. We can see in year-to-date,\nthat's why we did year-to-date. Every quarter, we've been getting these questions about this provisional\nprice adjustments. So I'll start with a picture in year-to-date. As you can see here, basically, most of it is\nrelated to the fourth quarter of last year, right? So $20 million of the $29 million is related to the fourth\nquarter last year. So why the delay? Because this trade stayed open, and they will be rolling into these\ncommercial relationships and sell with the previous -- with the unpaid portion of the previous shipments.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nAs we change the contracts and change the commercial relationships completely, we just closed out this\nin our books. So essentially, what we're showing here is basically the complete closeout of all these open\ntrades, G2, G3, G4, basically, all the trades -- the 6 boats all the way from the fourth quarter and the\nfirst quarter closed out completely on an accounting basis, right? So interestingly enough, this closeout\ngenerated a positive cash inflow of USD 7 million because that was the remained unpaid portion of those\ntrades that actually we got to receive, and we were no longer rolling out into the subsequent boat to\nabsorb either upward adjustment or negative cash adjustments.\nWe can go through that in quite a lot of detail with you in the call, we have a page in a posted material\nonline that kind of shows that Matt did that -- it was very good work. If we reallocate all these\nadjustments to each respective quarter, you can clearly see how they even each other out and show that\n-- the trades are actually accurately marked in our book. And again, this was a closeout of all the open\nbook trades, right? So mostly related to the fourth quarter.\nNow why the fourth quarter? Because that's when the price dropped precipitously. We had done the\nmarkup, it had been -- we suffered that cash hit throughout the year, but then the accounting books,\ngiven that these boats got shipped in the first quarter, we were evaluating whether those prices were\nactually correct because they seemed too low if compared to the benchmark in December. But as we all\nknow, the price actually fell lower than the benchmark could capture throughout the fourth quarter. So it\nwas what it was. So it took us a while because we were closely examining each one of the deliveries to be\nabsolutely sure that, that was the actual correct realized price.\nKatie Lachapelle\nCanaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division\nGot it. Maybe a follow-up question. I just want to pivot a bit to Phase 3 and 4. You are talking about those\nexpansions more. I know it's still early days, but how are you thinking about maybe the capital cost for\nboth of those or how you're thinking about funding those? Because we are sitting almost in 2025, so 2026\nand 2027 is pretty soon.\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nNo, I mean, we have obviously quite a competitive advantage in now this development bank relationship\nwith BNDES. What you see in front of you is what we presented BNDES with as our complete industrial\ndevelopment plant for processing lithium and for aggregating even more value to lithium in Brazil,\ndelivering the lithium chemical. So they've been an incredible partner for Sigma. And so essentially, the\nway we see the funding, well, first, the amount of funding. As you recall, and we posted that slide again\nonline, it's more of the same. We're going to build a third plant exactly like the second, which is exactly\nlike the first. Mine was the infrastructure.\nSo looking at the final CapEx for this second plant is going to cost us around USD 98 million -- USD 95\nmillion depending on the BRL rate, which works to our favor. Because about 70% of the equipment is\nactually nationalize is Brazilian, right? So that's Plant 2. Plant 3 will be the same. So our typical DMS\nGreentech plan costs about that much, $100 million. Now the current infrastructure supports 3 lines. And\nthis is why we highlight 105,000 LCEs, right? That's what's built in infrastructure on site. Well, in order to\nbuild a fourth concentrator there, what else do we need to do? Well, we need to add capacity in the water\ntreatment area and in the substation, adding more transformers to power the fourth line. That is not a\nwhole lot more infrastructure. That should be around up USD 15 million to USD 20 million in infrastructure\nversus the USD 50 million in infrastructure that we spent to put it all there.\nWhy? Because the industrial site is prepared, the pipeline that brings the water, the sewage water from\nthe [indiscernible] River to site is already there. It's a 6-kilometer pipeline. All of it is there, and that\ntakes care of 4 units. But operationally, we need more water treatment capacity and we need more power.\nNow the intermediate lithium chemical, we haven't concluded the studies. So we will be talking about the\nCapEx there once we conclude the studies. But again, I will advance that we will do this the Sigma way,\nwhich is the China way. We've demonstrated that we built it quite cheaply in Brazil.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nIn fact, we are looking to partner with the larger producer of [indiscernible] rotating kill equipment in\nChina, which is used by [indiscernible] in North Carolina, is used by everyone around the world in order\nto deliver this unit. It's a quite simple unit. I mean, it's a rotating kill and an acid leach unit, so formic\nacid leach unit. So better spodumene acid leach lithium sulphate. So it's not all the way down to specialty\nchemicals. Now with that, we plan to become the linchpin of a global chemical-to-chemical supply chain.\nAnd perhaps making life easier throughout the Northern Hemisphere for all of our potential customers that\nwould want to set up specialty chemicals in their own territories. We'll be shipping chemicals. We will be\nupcycling the waste here in our cement industries in Brazil, so zero waste. And therefore, we assume a\nclean chemical material and they don't have to deal with the waste generated in this reduction process,\nwhich is quite large. It's 12 tonnes of waste per tonne of chemical.\nRogerio Marchini\nCFO & Executive VP of Corporate Finance\nNot to belabor this because again, we will release more details in the study. But I think just to add, right,\nthe goal is to not compete against China in the carbonate or hydroxide markets, given what we see as a\nhighly subsidized business there and pretty competitive margins. Our goal is to still sell into that market\nand bank what we think is the value and use we have domestically as well as the local economics. Sorry,\nAna for chiming in.\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nYes. We will supply China. In fact, the litmus test for this strategic decision was that we received\nsignificant interest from our clients in China because I think the cherry on top is that we can deliver\nnegative carbon lithium sulphate to China. So perhaps we could even enable zero carbon lithium\ncarbonate chemicals in China and help decarbonize the entire lithium supply chain. So again, interest from\neverywhere, we're here to deliver a product that's going to be globally competitive. Half the market is\nChina, half the market is the rest of the world, so competitive all over. It isn't something we're doing just\nfor part of the market. It is, again, like our lithium oxide concentrate is a globally competitive product.\nAnd at that, we get the development bank financing because their mindset is to finance what we call\nthe industrial champion, the Brazilian winning companies that actually are gaining market share and\npositioning Brazil globally in key export industries, in this case, critical minerals lithium.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO.\nJoel Jackson\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\nI'm going to ask a few questions one by one, if that's okay. Just maybe following up on Katie's question.\nSo if we think of the Q4, should pricing be similar to Q3? Can I think about -- you've given production, so\ncan I think about grade and cost being similar? And you said you've closed out some of the Glencore stuff,\nbut again, for pricing, can we think about it being similar to Q3, better worse so far?\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nThis is basically third quarter. You can see on the screen. So we actually booked final trades at 820. We\nwill hover -- the market oscillated because it became very volatile for a while in October, but it's here. Can\nyou see this screen? Yes. Yes, there you go. Yes, that is -- so you can see -- yes, we're all seeing the same\nscreen, exactly. So this is third quarter, and it's pretty close to final. In fact, 820 was a trade we booked,\nfinal. So it's -- you're going to get the same ballpark. And we're showing you the great adjustment as well.\nSo from -- it's from 6% to 5.2%. So that's kind of the question now, right?\nSo essentially, how does grade work here at Sigma? We're probably one of the few companies that\ncould be delivering 6% without that much loss to volumes. But because nobody else is, and this is not\nappropriately priced, clearly, right, what we do, Joe, is we set our product to Australian quality. So we\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nharnessed what was being offered by our trading peers and what kind of grade they are offering in the\nmarket. And we adjust our plant down to that grade because it's very easy to adjust that, right, hard is to\nadjust up, so that we benefit from a rather exponential increase in volumes when we conduct that process\nor we bank that over as inventory.\nJoel Jackson\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research\nOkay. That's helpful. And then a couple of questions. So I wanted to ask about production of Phase I\nand then thinking about Phase II. So I'll ask a couple of questions at once here. So as recently as a few\nquarters -- a quarter ago, you were really talking about $22,000 a tonne production and sales run rate.\nNow you sell into $20,000 tonnes -- $20,000 a month. Now you seem like you've sell at $20,000 a month.\nSo the first part of the question is, what's kind of changed between the 22 and the 20? And second part of\nthe question is, I think you've maybe made a big contractor change for Phase 2. Can you talk about that?\nIt seems like you spent very little CapEx on Phase 2 in Q3. So talk about the contractor change, how much\nCapEx you spent on Phase 2 so far maybe October, November. So a couple of questions there.\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nWell, let me talk about the production first. 60,000 is guidance because essentially, we conducted our\nefficiency project this quarter. So we're hoping to guide and beat guidance again. But the cadence\nof 22,000 is actually a very good -- is a great observation. We've always -- we try to achieve that\ncadence. But what we -- the real accomplishment as we harnessed our operational capabilities here\nand increased the performance excellence was to shorten the space or the number of days intervals\nbetween each shipment. So as we announce each shipment, you can easily ascertain that by looking at\nthe announcement. They became shorter and shorter and now they're close to 30-day cadence, right?\nSo this kind of gives you an indication where we're going, meaning we're shifting 22,000 every month. So\nmultiply by 12, that's it. So as we haven't done that throughout the whole year, so we're basically guiding\nand hoping to be guidance. But ultimately here is that frequency decrease of the same volume that is\nactually the real accomplishment because with that, we are increasing the total quarterly production. So\nthat was your first question. Then your second question is about Phase 2.\nSo we are planning to publish a more comprehensive update on Phase II shortly, and that will have the\nCapEx disbursed total for the Phase II. But we estimate now that with the first BNDES disbursement,\nand that's an important point you made that I'm going to reiterate. The first is [indiscernible] BNDES is\nspending of the bank guarantees. So when it happens, when we get the first actual cash in the banking\nflow, that reimburses us for all the CapEx spent in arrears since the moment BNDES announced our loan\nwhich was February 9 of this year.\nSo everything we spent in CapEx screwed out gets reimbursed at once in that first disbursement by BNDS.\nSo it gives us sort of a boost because we've been using some of the cash generated to pay for CapEx, for\ninstance, this quarter, it was $5 million. But then we kind of get to recoup that at once as a boost of cash\ninflow. We estimate now that, that sits probably close to $25 million. And again, there are fluctuations\nhere because of the devaluation of the real currency, right? But just to give you guys a number in dollars,\nit should be around $20 million to $25 million, right?\nAnd again, it's mostly real expenditures. So that's the number that we have incurred on to date on\nthe CapEx. The third question was around the contractor change in Phase II and what have you. It\nwasn't really a change. What we've done -- and that's a very good question, too, because we wanted to\nclarify that point. We maintained the same engineering company, DRA, that actually worked on our filed\nfeasibility study in SEDAR in the 43-101, which we will be updating together with the annual filing.\nWell, we haven't changed, and that was a significant change, but it's a natural change, it's the way we're\ngoing to manage that construction. Because in the Phase I construction, we relied on a local engineering\ncompany with -- for safety for local management, local engineers for basically running construction\nbecause we didn't have a construction team in-house or project management capabilities in-house\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nor much of that. So we were entirely reliant on our engineering contractors to actually deliver that\nconstruction. That is the change.\nThis construction is being done in-house with our team, with our personnel because we have probably\none of the best project teams in the whole industry based on all that we've executed in the very Plant 1\nthroughout the last 12 months in terms of implementing operational efficiency. So essentially, that project\nteam has already been clearly demonstrating their incredible execution products. And this [indiscernible]\nwhich sits in the filed materials actually shows that we executed a full plant shutdown with 2 major pieces\nof equipment assembled and commissioned in 4 days.\nI mean -- and I even put here what the plan was and the real was and we were having like 3 daily calls\nwith the team to kind of follow the progress of how this was being executed, but essentially that we call\nthe efficiency project for the Greentech plant was -- has been executed over many months, but it was\nactually constructed in 4 days, right? We got all the equipment to site, we got it already. We shut down\nthe plant, put the equipment up, it was marvelous to see how well-oiled machine we have in terms of our\nmaintenance teams, project management, all of it, right?\nSo in fact, the result of that, I'm going to reiterate, we're already partly reflected in third quarter, but it's\ngoing to be mainly reflected now in the fourth quarter, and that will be the potential increasing production\nof another 10% to 15%. In another picture just to show that -- and I really want to show this picture.\nSo you see here the screens on the ground, 3 days later, they were up and running. This is the screens\nto upgrade the ultrafine circuit to improve the feed mix. So essentially, it's optimization of capacity\nwhere [indiscernible] and what have you so that we optimize our DMS capacity to 230 tonnes an hour to\nprobably 240 to 250 tonnes an hour.\nAnd here, the same with magnetic separator. So you see them on the ground and literally, in 3 days,\nthey were up and running, which is for all of you who know magnetic separators is an incredible\naccomplishment from our industrial team. So again, the purpose here is to clear out, again, the iron\noxide and also remove the ferrosilicon and recycle the ferrosilicon. So we're very proud, I mean, of the\ncommitment and the prowess of our teams and particularly our industrial team.\nOperator\nOur final question comes from the line of Shannon Gill from Cormark Securities.\nShannon Gill\nCormark Securities Inc., Research Division\nJust following on from Joe here. Can we expect increased recoveries in Q4 with the ongoing plant\noptimization and in Q1 of next year as you move from using mobile crushers to a fully optimized Phase 1\nplant crusher? Can we expect continued recovery increases? Can you just speak to recovery there?\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nAbsolutely. So you made 2 excellent questions, and I want to bring this point back again. Essentially,\nwe are indeed going to experience increase in global recoveries. And I want to take the opportunity to\nclarify a fallacy and a misunderstanding about our plant recoveries. I mean, we're basically getting to\nplant recoveries in a dense media separation. There are -- that is the highest in the world. This has never\never been achieved. It's 70% of DMS recoveries. But then you look at our global recoveries, meaning\ntotal recovery, it's 55%. So that gap is up for grabs. It's opportunity for operational improvement, also by\nmanaging to reprocess and to treat and concentrate the fines that are responsible -- ultrafines that are\nresponsible for this difference into that DMS Greentech plant.\nWe have 2 projects that we are planning to achieve that. The first one, we just executed. So absolutely\nyes. That's the answer. We expect these recoveries to kind of reach pretty close to 60% or perhaps more\nin global recoveries because what we put here was a circuit that in addition to optimizing the capacity of\nthe GMS itself, will actually improve the recoveries of the lithium mark side in the ultrafines, one.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\nSIGMA LITHIUM CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 15, 2024\nThen mobile crushers. Mobile crushes was a different matter. What happened to mobile crushers, it was\na design engineering change. In other words, we contracted mobile crushers in -- with a local Brazilian\nsupplier. And the method through which this crusher executed their tasks, instead of having the motor\nand the screen separate, sliding on each other, their design was one where the screens and the motor was\nconnected and they would slide together. So any issues in screens would mean we would have to stop the\ncrusher. We've been dealing with it most of the year.\nAnd then finally, we had enough of it, decided to put in 2 mobile crushers in June and July, to basically\npick up the balance of our main crushers so that we would run our crusher at a lower capacity and then\nchange the way that flow occurs. In other words, we went to the original parts manufacturer in South\nAfrica, it's called [indiscernible] and we're getting the new circuit, where screens and motor vibrate\nseparately so that the pressure is more resilient operationally. And therefore, we expect the crusher to be\na non-hinderance because, again, we have this incredible dense media separation Greentech plant, and\nwe're having issues with a crusher, which is kind of basic. It's the most basic part of our circuit.\nSo think about this, we fixed the Model 3, the dry stacking, which doesn't even exist in the industry. That\nwas last year. Then we perfected the dense media separation to process lithium like no other in the world.\nSo we basically evolved this technology, and we were getting stuck with lower production volumes because\nof the crusher. It was kind of sad, right? So we decided to tackle it at once and essentially put mobile\ncrushers, which are here temporarily. So they're costing an extra $25 a tonne. But then in December, we\ndecommissioned the first and then in February, we decommissioned the second, we built a nice stockpile\nto actually change that crusher flow sheet.\nRogerio Marchini\nCFO & Executive VP of Corporate Finance\nI'd say one more thing. All of these changes comes back on Phase 2. All this investment, all this work flow\nwill come [indiscernible] work we have to do again. So less [indiscernible] capitalized. Rob, if you want --\nAna, if you want to make any closing comments or...\nAna Cabral-Gardner\nCo-Chairperson & CEO\nNo, again, I want to thank you for your trust, for your confidence, for believing in us executing through\nthe lithium market ebbs and flows. As we demonstrated, we're one of the most resilient businesses in the\nindustry. We're in a low-cost environment. This is now being underwritten by some of our competitors in\nother parts of the world, which we're all welcoming here in Brazil. So again, I want to leave the quarter\ncall with a message of, what we call, sober optimism because one thing for sure, we reached the floor,\ngiven that so much of the traceable compliant production of lithium is not profitable at these levels, we\nare, but unfortunately, most of the production of traceable material isn't.\nAnd the industry is clearly increasing the game, raising the game on procurement and focusing on\nexamining traceability of the product. So we believe that with the removal of kind of a lot of untraceable\nmaterial, mainly coming from Africa, we're going to see -- we saw the floor being placed in the industry,\nand we're going to see a decent year in 2025. And I think from there, as you can see then in demand, the\ndynamics is there. China has been posting very, very robust EV growth numbers for a market than large\nand with a penetration that large. September was 44%. October is reaching 50%. EV uptake is over 50%,\nwhich is a record number. China will be probably almost 60% of the global in the industry by the next\nquarter. So it's extremely healthy there. One of the key recipients of the stimulus, the various stimulus\nbeing directed at the economy. So again, it's a message of sober, cautious optimists entering into the\nfourth quarter. Thank you.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

We also\nbenefited from our shifted commercial strategy to navigate industry seasonality, enabling us to secure higher\naverage realized prices compared to benchmarks.\n“Over the last year we are proud to have transformed Sigma from an emerging producer into an industry leader,\ndemonstrating the operational and financial resilience of a mature producer, with dependability and consistency.\nMeanwhile we have delivered on all of our climate goals, reaching Net Zero one year in advance of our target and\n27 years ahead of the industry, with our Quintuple Zero Green Lithium. We are confident that over the lithium\ncycles, our capabilities to execute to strategy will deliver long-term value for Sigma and all of its stakeholders”,\nMs. Cabral concluded.\nKey Performance Metrics for Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 (US$)\nUnit 3Q24 2Q24\nSales Revenue for Shipents in Quarter $ 000s 44,210 54,418\nProvisional Price Adjustment $ 000s (23,316) (8,498)\nTotal Sales Revenue $ 000s 20,894 45,920\nConcentrate Sold tonnes 57,483 52,572\nConcentrate Grade Sold % 5.2% 5.5%\nAverage Reported Selling Price CIF (1) $/t 820 1,056\nAverage Revenue per Tonne CIF (2) $/t 415 894\nUnit Operating Cost CIF (3) $/t 513 515\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 000s 65,594 75,330\nRevenues in the third quarter totaled US$44.2 million or US$20.9 million net of provisional price adjustments.\nThe Company has undergone a significant evolution in its commercial relationship with trading companies,\nstrengthening commercial conditions. As a result of this change in strategy the Company concluded the final\nsettlement of provisional sales invoices from previous quarters conducted through our traders, generating an\naccounting adjustment of US$(23.3) million. Importantly, these are primarily non-cash accounting closing\nsettlements and do not have an effect on the future earnings potential of the Company.\nIn 3Q, Sigma Lithium maintained one of the lowest cash unit operating costs in the industry, with CIF China\naveraging US$ 513/t, down from US$ 515/t in 2Q24, in line with target levels.\n• Cash unit operating costs(3) for lithium concentrate produced at the Company’s Grota do Cirilo operations\nin the third quarter averaged US$ 395/t (including a temporary US$25/t for mobile crushers).\n• On an FOB Vitoria(3) basis (which includes transportation and port charges) costs averaged US$449/t.\n• On a CIF China basis(3) (includes ocean freight, insurance and royalties) costs averaged US$513/t.\nRobust operating cash flow generation of US$ 34 million in the third quarter enabled the Company to maintain\na healthy cash position of US$ 66 million, ultimately reflecting the non-cash nature of the accounting\nadjustments to the quarter.\n• The Company delivered third quarter cash adjusted EBITDA(4) of US$(10.6) million. Reported EBITDA for\nthe third quarter totaled US$(12.8) million.\n• The cash adjusted EBITDA number excludes US$0.8 million of non-recurring expenditures, primarily\nrelated to capital markets and cost initiatives, and US$1.4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation\nexpenses.\nNet income in the quarter totaled US$(25.1) million or US$(0.23) per diluted share outstanding. These reported\nresults were affected by the aforementioned US$(23.3) million in accounting adjustments.\nOperational Update\nSigma Lithium achieved strong operational performance at its Greentech industrial plant in the third quarter.\nProduction of Sigma Lithium’s Quintuple Zero Lithium Concentrate totaled 60,237t, up 22% from 2Q24 and\nahead of the 60,000t guidance. This includes numerous daily production records and periods of sustained\noperations above 860t per day. The Company expects 4Q24 production of lithium concentrate to reach at least\n60,000 tonne.\nCommercial Strategy Update\nSigma Lithium sold 57,483 tonnes of its Quintuple Zero Green Lithium concentrate in the third quarter, when its\noperational performance enabled it to further increase shipping cadence to quasi monthly volumes sold of\n22,000t. As a result, the Company made two full 22,000t shipments during the quarter and supplemented these\nvolumes with 13,483t sold at the Port customs warehouse.\nOperational reliability and a consistent shipment pattern lowered the Company’s export credit risk, increasing\nthe availability and lowering the interest rate of its trade finance lines. This generated direct benefits for Sigma’s\ncommercial strategy, enabling the Company to further geographically diversify its accounts receivables, shipping\nto three distributors across the world: Glencore AG (Europe), Mitsubishi Corporation RtM International Pte. Ltd\n(Japan/ Singapore), and International Resources Holdings (UAE/Abu Dhabi).\nThe interest rate cost of the Company’s trade finance export credit lines decreased substantially over the year\nfrom nearly 15.5% in 4Q23 to 9.0% in 3Q24. In parallel, the amount of available export trade lines exceeded US$\n100 million in the year.\nThe increased financial flexibility enabled the Company to strengthen its commercial strategy and change its\ndistribution relationship with trading companies from “traders as principals” to “traders as distributors”. This\nstrategy shift allows Sigma to capitalize on annual restocking trends of chemical refiners, weather seasonality\nmore effectively and outperform market price benchmarks, achieving average CIF sales price for the third\nquarter of US$ 820/t.\nWhile Sigma Lithium ships and sells monthly to its trading partners, its goal is to build maximum flexibility in the\nfinal re-sale to clients to benefit from the established seasonality of refiners’ restocking periods. When combined\nwith its superior metallurgical properties and the associated value-in-use driven cost savings to customers,\nSigma believes it has positioned itself to drive superior price realizations over time.\nThis commercial strategy of “trader as a distributor” was not yet in place during Company’s second through\nseventh shipments, when trading partners served as the principals to the transaction. The accounting provisional\nprice adjustment booked in this quarter was mainly a result of the booking of final invoice settlement and closing\nof these trades.\nPhase 2 Expansion\nRecall, on April 1, 2024, the Board of Directors announced a Final Investment Decision for the Company’s Phase\n2 Greentech Plant expansion. The project is expected to add 250,000 tonnes of production capacity to the\ncurrent Phase 1 operation. Importantly, the Company has already received all relevant licenses to build and\noperate this second Greentech Plant.\nIn 3Q, Sigma Lithium initiated earthworks by completing clearing of the terrain for arid and semi-arid vegetation\nsuppression (including fauna capture and classification) for the entire industrial project, including future phase\n3 construction of production plant. Total building and commissioning are expected to occur over a 12-month\nperiod, with budgeted capex for Phase 2 of BRL492 million (approximately US$90mm at current exchange\nrates).\nOn August 29, the National Brazilian Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) delivered a binding\ncommitment to Sigma for a BRL 487mm development loan to finance this expansion.\nOn October 10, Sigma and the BNDES signed the final binding loan agreement, concluding the closing of the\nloan package. The first disbursement of the development loan is pending the Company posting bank guarantees\nwith BNDES. This disbursement shall reimburse the capex already disbursed by the Company since first\napproval of the development bank loan.\nThe key terms and conditions of the development loan are:\n• Amount: BRL 487 million\n• Term: 192 months (16 years)\n• Interest Rate: BRL 7.53% per year (US$ at approximately 2.5% at prevailing swap rates).\n• Amortization Grace Period: 18 months – Calendarized Amortization: 174 months\n• Assets in Collateral: Not required. Development Loan shall be secured by letter of credit (“fianca\nbancaria”) issued by a BNDES registered financial institution.\nPlant 2 Construction at Grota do Cirilo.\nBalance Sheet & Liquidity\nRobust operating cash flow generation of US$ 34 million during the third quarter enabled the Company to\nmaintain a healthy cash position. Sigma Lithium ended the third quarter with US$65.6 million in cash and cash\nequivalents.\nFree cash flow in the quarter totaled US$32 million primarily related to a reduction in working capital associated\nwith the collection of accounts receivable.\nCash generation in the third quarter enabled the Company to repay certain export credit debt, reducing\noutstanding trade line balances. At the end of the quarter, the Company had US$181 million in short-term and\nlong-term debt. This included US$59 million in drawn and available, but unutilized, additional liquidity through\ntrade finance lines.\nCapital expenditures during the third quarter totaled US$2.5 million (C$3.1 million) directed towards\nmaintenance, mining, Phase 2 expansion work, and incremental investments in the Greentech Plant.\nABOUT SIGMA LITHIUM\nSigma Lithium (NASDAQ: SGML, TSXV: SGML, BVMF: S2GM34) is a leading global lithium producer dedicated\nto powering the next generation of electric vehicle batteries with carbon neutral, socially and environmentally\nsustainable chemical-grade lithium concentrate.\nSigma Lithium is one of the world’s largest lithium producers.

These non-IFRS financial measures are\na supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to, the Company's results presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-\nIFRS financial measures presented by the Company may be different from non-GAAP/IFRS financial measures presented by\nother companies. Specifically, the Company believes the non-IFRS information provides useful measures to investors\nregarding the Company's financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that the Company believes are not\nindicative of its core operating results. The presentation of these non-U.S. GAAP/IFRS financial measures is not meant to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for results or guidance prepared and presented in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP/IFRS. A reconciliation of these financial measures to IFRS results is included herein.\n1: Average selling price, CIF represents revenues associated with shipments invoiced during the reporting period netted out against\ntotal volume shipped. The final price may be higher or lower than the invoiced price based on future price movements.\n2: Reported revenue per tonne, CIF equivalent reflects net revenues for the quarter and tonnes shipped. Given a change in accounting\npolicy in 3Q, the Company is not realizing the ocean freight and insurance costs associated with its 3Q shipments until product has\nbeen received by the final customer. Thus, this exercise is grossing up the reported revenues for these costs to create a more peer\nand market comparable figure. The final price may be higher or lower than the estimated realized price based on future price\nmovements.\nThree Months\nEnded September\nRevenue Bridge - Unaudited 30, 2024\n$000 USD\n3Q24 Invoiced Revenues - CIF $44,550\nProvisional price adjustment for shipments: 3Q24 2,607\n3Q24 Revenues - CIF $47,157\nAdjustment for CIF Accounting (2,947)\n3Q24 Revenues - FOB $44,210\nProvisional price adjustment for shipments: 1Q24 - 2Q24 (15,611)\nProvisional price adjustment for shipments: 3Q23 - 4Q23 (7,705)\nReported Revenues - FOB $20,894\nAdjustment for CIF Accounting 2,947\nReported Revenues - CIF 23,841\nLithium Concentrate Sales Volumes 57,483\n$ / tonne\n3Q24 Invoiced Price - CIF $775\nProvisional price adjustment for shipments: 3Q24 45\n3Q24 Price - CIF $820\nAdjustment for CIF Accounting (51)\n3Q24 Price - FOB $769\n3. Cash unit operating costs include mining, processing, and site based general and administration costs. It is calculated on an incurred\nbasis, credits for any capitalised mine waste development costs, and it excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization of mine and\nprocessing associated activities. When reported on an FOB basis, this metric includes road freight, and port related charges. When\nreported on a CIF basis it includes ocean freight, insurance and royalty costs. Royalty costs include a 2% government royalty and a\n1% private royalty.\nFor CIF production cost analysis purposes, Sigma is considering the ocean freight costs of product that sailed in the month of\nreporting. However, for accounting purposes, and thus in this quarter’s reported cost of good sold and revenues, the ocean freight\ncost is to be recognized the moment material is delivered to the customer. Overtime, this will even out as a consistent pattern of boats\nare shipped and delivered, but as it is a newly adopted accounting policy, it is translating to a lower reported dollar revenue and cost\nfor 3Q24 than what is implied by our CIF production and revenue accounting above.\n4. Adjusted Cash EBITDA is a measure of recurring core earnings profile of the company. It is calculated as revenues minus cash\noperating and selling expenses. The calculation excludes non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based\ncompensation expenses as well as certain non-recurring cash expenses such as legal expenses associated with capital markets or\nstrategic initiatives.\nAdjusted Cash EBITDA Bridge\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\nEBITDA Bridge - Unaudited September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\n($ 000) CAD USD\nSales Revenues 59,887 44,210\nProvisional price adjustments (31,612) (23,316)\nRevenues 28,275 20,894\nCost of goods sold & distribution (39,733) (29,232)\nGross Profit (11,458) (8,338)\nSales expenses (535) (392)\nG&A expense (7,163) (5,252)\nStock-based compensation (1,871) (1,369)\nESG & other operating expenses, net (416) (304)\nEBIT (21,444) (15,655)\nDepreciation & Amortization 3,912 2,876\nEBITDA (17,532) (12,779)\nEBITDA (%) -62% -61%\nNon-recurring expenses (1) 1,089 798\nStock-based compensation 1,871 1,369\nAdjusted Cash EBITDA (14,571) (10,612)\nAdjusted EBITDA (%) -52% -51%\n(1)Non-recurring expenses include certain legal and advisory costs and severance costs associated with ongoing productivity initiatives."
