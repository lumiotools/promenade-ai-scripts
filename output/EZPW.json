We also drove material growth on the bottom line, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 15% to over $150 million and adjusted diluted EPS increasing 20% to $1.12. This exceptional performance is a testament to our 8,000+ team members, whose dedication to delivering market-leading customer service has driven these outstanding operating and financial results. We continue to see strong consumer demand for immediate cash solutions and high-quality, cost-effective second-hand goods, fueled by what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. Customer participation in our EZ+ Rewards program continues to flourish, with 44% growth year over year, representing 76% of unique transactions during the quarter. Our online payments also increased 34% year over year, further reflecting robust customer engagement across our platforms.\n\n“During the quarter, we grew our footprint by adding 21 stores, including one acquired store in the U.S. and 20 de novo stores in Latin America. We continue to focus on strategic expansion and our fiscal 2024 results reflect the resurgence of our Latin American business, with adjusted segment contribution increasing 41% to $38.2 million. We now operate 1,279 stores across five countries. We remain excited by our inorganic pipeline and the scale of pawn opportunity in both our existing markets and globally.\n\n“As we enter the new fiscal year, we are fully committed to our core values of People, Pawn, and Passion. We will continue to invest in our people, technology, and store network to drive sustainable growth and enhance operational efficiency, and we are well-positioned to build upon our momentum and capitalize on new growth opportunities as we deliver long-term value for our shareholders,” concluded Given.\n\n**CONSOLIDATED RESULTS**\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30**| **As Reported**| **Adjusted****1**  \n---|---|---  \n _in millions, except per share amounts_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nTotal revenues| $| 294.6| $| 270.5| $| 300.9| $| 270.5  \nGross profit| $| 175.4| $| 159.4| $| 178.9| $| 159.4  \nIncome before tax| $| 26.3| $| 13.1| $| 27.4| $| 22.6  \nNet income| $| 15.2| $| 10.3| $| 18.9| $| 17.3  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 0.21| $| 0.15| $| 0.26| $| 0.23  \nEBITDA (non-GAAP measure)| $| 35.5| $| 22.4| $| 36.7| $| 31.9  \n  \n**Twelve Months Ended September 30**| **As Reported**| **Adjusted****1**  \n---|---|---  \n _in millions, except per share amounts_| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nTotal revenues| $| 1,161.6| $| 1,049.0| $| 1,153.8| $| 1,049.0  \nGross profit| $| 682.3| $| 609.8| $| 678.0| $| 609.8  \nIncome before tax| $| 115.6| $| 51.6| $| 114.9| $| 93.9  \nNet income| $| 83.1| $| 38.5| $| 84.7| $| 70.9  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| 1.10| $| 0.53| $| 1.12| $| 0.93  \nEBITDA| $| 151.7| $| 92.8| $| 150.8| $| 131.5  \n  \n  * PLO increased 12% to $274.1 million, up $28.3 million. On a same-store basis, PLO increased 11% due to improved operational performance and continued strong pawn demand.\n  * In the fourth quarter, total revenues increased 9%, and gross profit increased 10%, reflecting improved pawn service charge (PSC) revenues and merchandise sales as a result of higher average PLO. Similarly for the full year, total revenues increased 11% and gross profit increased 12%.\n  * PSC increased 10% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year as a result of higher average PLO.\n  * For the fourth quarter, merchandise sales gross margin remains within our target range at 35%, down from 36%. Aged general merchandise was 1.7% of total general merchandise inventory, a 150 bps improvement over the third quarter. For the full year, merchandise sales gross profit margin was flat at 36%.\n\n\n  * Net inventory increased 15%, as expected with the growth in PLO. Inventory turnover decreased to 2.6x for the quarter, from 2.7x and was flat at 2.8x for the year.\n  * For the fourth quarter, store expenses increased 7% and 5% on a same-store basis. For the full year, store expenses increased 10% and 9% on a same-store basis, primarily due to increased labor driven by inflationary and minimum wage increases, and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to rent.\n  * General and administrative expenses increased 11% in the fourth quarter and increased 12% for the full year, primarily due to labor including incentive compensation and, to a lesser extent, costs related to the implementation and ongoing support of Workday.\n  * For the fourth quarter, income before taxes was $26.3 million, up 100% from $13.1 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to $36.7 million. For the full year, income before taxes increased by 124% to $115.6 million from $51.6 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to $150.8 million.\n  * Diluted earnings per share was $0.21 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.15. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.26, up from $0.23. For the full year, diluted earnings per share was $1.10, compared to $0.53. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for the year was $1.12, compared to $0.93. The primary difference between GAAP and adjusted financial results for the prior year is attributable to our share of the one-time, non-cash goodwill impairment recognized by Cash Converters International.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $170.5 million, down 23% year-over-year. The decrease was due to the 2024 convertible debt maturity and payoff, an increase in PLO and inventory, strategic investments and acquisitions, and share repurchases, partially offset by cash from operating activities.\n\n\n\n**SEGMENT RESULTS**\n\nU.S. Pawn\n\n  * PLO ended the year at $214.3 million, up 12% on a total and same-store basis.\n  * In the fourth quarter, total revenues increased 9% and gross profit increased 10%, reflecting higher PSC and merchandise sales. Similarly for the full year, total revenues increased 10% and gross profit increased 10%.\n  * PSC increased 10% in the fourth quarter and increased 13% for the full year as a result of higher average PLO.\n  * During the fourth quarter, merchandise sales increased 7%, and gross margin decreased to 37% from 38%. For the full year, merchandise sales increased 6% and merchandise sales gross profit margin decreased 100 bps to 37%.\n  * Net inventory increased 8%, as expected with the growth in PLO. Inventory turnover increased to 2.5x for the quarter, from 2.4x and was flat at 2.6x for the full year. Aged general merchandise increased to 2.6%, or $1.2 million of total general merchandise inventory. Compared to the third quarter, this has decreased by 240 bps. Excluding luxury handbags in our three Max Pawn stores in Las Vegas, aged general merchandise remains under 1%.\n  * In the fourth quarter, store expenses increased 10% (7% on a same-store basis), primarily due to labor costs driven by inflation. Similarly for the full year, store expenses increased 9% (8% on a same store basis).\n  * Segment contribution increased 10% to $41.0 million in the fourth quarter and increased 13% to $165.3 million for the full year.\n  * Segment store count increased by 13 to 542 due to the acquisition of 13 stores, the addition of one de novo store and the consolidation of one store during the full year.\n\n\n\nLatin America Pawn\n\n  * PLO improved to $59.8 million, up 8% (18% on constant currency basis). On a same-store basis, PLO increased 7% (16% on a constant currency basis) due to improved operational performance and increased loan demand.\n  * In the fourth quarter, total revenues were up 9% (17% on constant currency basis), and gross profit increased 11% (20% on a constant currency basis), reflecting increased PSC, higher merchandise sales and improved merchandise sales gross profit. Similarly for the full year, total revenues were up 13% (11% on a constant currency basis), while gross profit increased by 18% (15% on a constant currency basis).\n  * PSC increased in the fourth quarter to $29.2 million, up 11% (19% on a constant currency basis) as a result of higher average PLO. Similarly for the full year, PSC increased 17% (14% on a constant currency basis).\n  * During the fourth quarter merchandise sales increased 6% and merchandise sales gross margin increased to 32% from 30%. For the full year merchandise sales increased 12% and merchandise gross margin increased 100 bps to 32%.\n  * Net inventory increased 42% (56% on a constant currency basis) due to increase in PLO, increase in store count and lower inventory turnover. Inventory turnover decreased to 2.8x, from 3.6x for the quarter. For the full year inventory turnover was 3.3x, down from 3.4x. Aged general merchandise remains less than 1% of total general merchandise inventory.\n  * In the fourth quarter, store expenses increased 1% (10% on a constant currency basis) and on a same-store basis decreased 1% (7% increase on a constant currency basis). Full year store expenses increased 13% (11% on a constant currency basis) and 12% (9% on a constant currency basis) on a same-store basis primarily due to increased labor headcount, in line with store activity and minimum wage increases and, to a lesser extent, rent associated with lease renewals.\n  * For the fourth quarter, segment contribution increased 59% (68% on a constant currency basis). For the full year, segment contribution was up 23% to $38.8 million (21% on a constant currency basis). On an adjusted basis, segment contribution for the fourth quarter was up 63% to $10.7 million and for the full year was up 41% to $38.2 million, with the primary prior year adjustment being the reversal of contingent consideration liability in connection with a previously completed acquisition.\n  * Segment store count increased by 35 to 737 due to the addition of 40 de novo stores and the consolidation of five stores during the full year.\n\n\n\n**FORM 10-K**\n\nEZCORP’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

accounting U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we provide certain other non-GAAP financial information on a constant currency (“constant currency”) and adjusted basis. We use constant currency results to evaluate our Latin America Pawn operations, which are denominated primarily in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and other Latin American currencies. We believe that presentation of constant currency and adjusted results is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of our GAAP consolidated financial statements. We use this non-GAAP financial information primarily to evaluate and compare operating results across accounting periods.\n\nReaders should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n\nConstant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations items denominated in local currency to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, we have an equity method investment that is denominated in Australian dollars and is translated into U.S. dollars. We used the end-of-period rate for balance sheet items and the average closing daily exchange rate on a monthly basis during the appropriate period for statement of operations items. The end-of-period and approximate average exchange rates for each applicable currency as compared to U.S. dollars as of and for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n\n**September 30,**| **Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Twelve****Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nMexican peso| 19.7| 17.4| 18.9| 17.1| 17.7| 18.3  \nGuatemalan quetzal| 7.6| 7.7| 7.6| 7.7| 7.6| 7.6  \nHonduran lempira| 24.6| 24.5| 24.4| 24.3| 24.4| 24.3  \nAustralian dollar| 1.4| 1.6| 1.5| 1.5| 1.5| 1.5  \n  \nOur statement of operations constant currency results reflect the monthly exchange rate fluctuations and so are not directly calculable from the above rates.

(NASDAQ:EZPW), a leading provider of pawn loans in the United States and Latin America, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 53 pawn stores in Mexico.\n\nThe seller, Presta Dinero, S.A. de C.V. and doing business as “Auto Dinero,” currently operates across 21 states in Mexico and specializes in two types of auto pawn transactions – auto (vehicle) pawn, where the pawnbroker takes possession of the vehicle, and title pawn, where the vehicle title document is pawned, allowing the customer to retain use of their vehicle while repaying the pawn transaction. Auto Dinero was founded in 2005 by Jorge Hernandez, an outstanding pawn executive with extensive experience in the industry, who will join EZCORP as a result of the transaction.\n\nLachie Given, EZCORP Chief Executive Officer, stated: “We are excited about our continued expansion in Mexico, where we are delivering significant growth. Auto pawn is a burgeoning segment of the pawn industry in Mexico, where vehicle ownership is on the rise. This exciting acquisition provides us with further geographic expansion in one of our core markets and leverages a strong local brand. It also realizes the strategic benefits of diversifying our product suite within pawn using much higher-value collateral, attracting a new customer demographic to our business, and enhancing our leadership team.”\n\nThe purchase agreement was entered into on September 10, 2024, and subject to customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close on or before October 31, 2024.\n\n**ABOUT EZCORP**\n\nFormed in 1989, EZCORP has grown into a leading provider of pawn transactions in the United States and Latin America.
