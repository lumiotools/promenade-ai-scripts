          "content": "Liberty Latin America Reports Q2 & H1 2024 Results\nSequential financial growth with Q2 reported revenue up 2%\nContinued strong Adjusted OIBDA growth in C&W Panama & C&W Caribbean\nPost-migration impacts in Puerto Rico; performance to improve in H2\nAgreement to combine operations with Tigo in Costa Rica\n>$300 million across share repurchases & convertible redemption to date in 2024\nDenver, Colorado - August 6, 2024: Liberty Latin America Ltd. (“Liberty Latin America” or “LLA”)\n(NASDAQ: LILA and LILAK, OTC Link: LILAB) today announced its financial and operating results for\nthe three months (“Q2”) and six months (“YTD” or “H1 2024”) ended June 30, 2024.\nCEO Balan Nair commented, “We continued to drive operational and financial growth across most of\nour businesses in the second quarter with notably strong performances in Panama, Costa Rica and the\nCaribbean. In Puerto Rico, whilst we experienced additional challenges following completion of the\nmobile subscriber migration, we remain confident of improved performance in the second half.”\n“Our focus on broadband and postpaid mobile additions continued to drive positive results with over\n100,000 net subscribers added in the second quarter across Central America and C&W Caribbean.\nThis was more than double the prior-year and 28% higher than the first quarter. The results were driven\nby strong mobile growth in Panama, where we successfully won customers following the exit of a\ncompetitor, and continued momentum in Costa Rica. We also recently announced the combination of\nour business in Costa Rica with Tigo, which we will control following closing.”\n“Costa Rica is a great country to operate in and Liberty Costa Rica is a strong business for us. By\ncombining Liberty and Tigo, the fixed operations will accelerate the transition to FTTH and will enable\nus to deliver exceptional high-speed services for consumers, provide enhanced customer experiences,\ndrive innovation, and offer growth opportunities for our people. In addition we just launched 5G across\nthe country and are gaining traction in the market as shown by our mobile growth.”\n“Looking to the second half of the year, we anticipate a significant inflection in financial performance as\nwe move past impacts from our Puerto Rico migration and begin to execute on our growth plans in that\nmarket, while maintaining healthy positive momentum across the rest of the group. In Puerto Rico, we\nnow expect synergies, operating cost improvements and top line sequential growth will drive Adjusted\nOIBDA to more than $45 million per month towards the end of the second half.”\n“We remain confident in achieving our medium term targets, and repurchased 12 million shares in the\nfirst half of the year, as well as redeeming our convertible notes that were due in July. In aggregate, this\nrepresents over $300 million of capital, which is equivalent to our entire spend in 2023.”\n1\nQ2 Business Highlights\n• C&W Caribbean: continued financial momentum\n◦ YoY reported and rebased revenue growth of 3% and 4%, respectively\n◦ YoY reported and rebased Adj. OIBDA growth of 7% and 8%, respectively\n• C&W Panama: strong subscriber growth and financial performance\n◦ 51,000 postpaid mobile subscriber additions as competitor exits market\n◦ YoY revenue and Adj. OIBDA growth of 9% and 10%, respectively\n• Liberty Networks: Strong enterprise growth\n◦ Resilient MRR performance in wholesale business with steady growth\n◦ YoY reported enterprise revenue up 17%\n• Liberty Puerto Rico: additional impacts following migration\n◦ Post migration operational challenges stabilizing\n◦ Operating and financial performance to significantly improve in H2 2024\n• Liberty Costa Rica: mobile momentum driving growth\n◦ Postpaid net adds 65% higher YoY\n◦ YoY reported and rebased revenue growth of 9% and 4%, respectively\nHurricane Beryl\nIn July 2024, Hurricane Beryl impacted our Jamaica operation and certain smaller operations within\nC&W Caribbean, resulting in varying degrees of damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure in\nthese markets. In connection with Hurricane Beryl, we expect to experience adverse subscriber and\nfinancial impacts during the remainder of 2024. We currently estimate that due to Hurricane Beryl:\n• Revenue and Adjusted OIBDA will be negatively impacted by between $10 million and $20\nmillion for the remainder of 2024, primarily during the third quarter, based on certain factors,\nsuch as when power is fully restored to the impacted areas.\n• We will incur property and equipment additions of approximately $10 million to $20 million to\nreplace infrastructure and equipment that has been damaged beyond repair or to enhance\nnetwork resiliency.\nHurricane Beryl triggered our weather derivatives and we expect to receive net third-party proceeds of\napproximately $44 million that will be reflected as a derivative gain in our financial statements. We are\nstill in the process of assessing the impact of Hurricane Beryl on our homes passed and subscribers.\nStock Repurchase Activity & Convertible Bond Redemption\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $22 million worth of stock, bringing the YTD 2024 total to $83\nmillion and representing 12 million shares.\nIn June 2024, we entered into a series of capped call option contracts on a total of 6 million Liberty\nLatin America Class A and Class C common shares with expiration of 12 to 18 months.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2024, we repurchased and cancelled the remaining $140 million of Convertible\nNotes upon maturity.\n2\nLiberty Latin America and Millicom Agree to Combine Operations in Costa Rica\nLiberty Latin America and Millicom International Cellular S.A. (\"Millicom\") announced on August 1,\n2024, that they had entered into an agreement to combine their respective operations in Costa Rica.\nUnder the terms of the all-stock agreement, Liberty Latin America and its minority partner in Costa Rica\nwill hold an approximate 86% interest and Millicom 14% in the joint operations with the final ownership\npercentage to be confirmed at closing.\nThe transaction reinforces the parties’ commitment to Costa Rica by creating a scaled platform and\naccelerating investments in fiber network expansion. In a market that is undergoing rapid technological\nadvancements with the deployment of fiber networks by multiple operators, this combination increases\nfiber competition ensuring high-quality, good value services and access to the digital economy.\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory authorizations, and we\nexpect the transaction to be completed during the second half of 2025.\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\nYoY YoY\nYoY Rebased YoY Rebased\nFinancial Highlights Q2 2024 Q2 2023 Decline Decline1 H1 2024 H1 2023 Decline Decline1\n(USD in millions)\nRevenue............................................. $ 1,118 $ 1,120 —% (1%) $ 2,217 $ 2,222 —% (1%)\nOperating income ............................. $ 111 $ 135 (18%) $ 204 $ 242 (16%)\nAdjusted OIBDA2 .............................. $ 389 $ 441 (12%) (12%) $ 763 $ 841 (9%) (10%)\nProperty & equipment additions ..... $ 180 $ 192 (7%) $ 315 $ 337 (7%)\nAs a percentage of revenue ... 16% 17% 14% 15%\nAdjusted FCF before distributions\nto noncontrolling interest\nowners............................................ $ (7) $ 72 $ (157) $ 22\nDistributions to noncontrolling\ninterest owners ............................. $ (11) $ (41) $ (11) $ (41)\nAdjusted FCF3................................ $ (18) $ 31 $ (168) $ (19)\nCash provided by operating\n$ 157 $ 226 $ 180 $ 288\nactivities .........................................\nCash used by investing activities ... $ (166) $ (159) $ (282) $ (291)\nCash used by financing activities... $ (55) $ (97) $ (281) $ (133)\nAmounts may not recalculate due to rounding.\nOperating Highlights4 Q2 2024 Q1 2024\nTotal customers............................................. 1,966,300 1,965,400\nOrganic customer additions.................... 900 14,500\nFixed RGUs ................................................... 3,997,400 3,978,100\nOrganic RGU additions............................. 19,300 44,700\nOrganic internet additions ........................ 8,900 21,800\nMobile subscribers........................................ 7,912,300 7,907,400\nOrganic mobile gains / (losses) .................. 20,800 (57,000)\nOrganic postpaid additions ...................... 8,100 23,200\n3\nRevenue Highlights\nThe following table presents (i) revenue of each of our segments and corporate operations for the\nperiods indicated and (ii) the percentage change from period-to-period on both a reported and rebased\nbasis:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30, Increase/(decrease) June 30, Increase/(decrease)\n2024 2023 % Rebased % 2024 2023 % Rebased %\nin millions, except % amounts\nC&W Caribbean ....................... $ 368.3 $ 356.3 3 4 $ 732.5 $ 710.1 3 4\nC&W Panama........................... 197.2 180.8 9 9 366.4 346.1 6 6\nLiberty Networks ...................... 119.1 118.6 — (1) 227.6 227.3 — (2)\nLiberty Puerto Rico .................. 308.6 349.5 (12) (12) 635.8 713.0 (11) (11)\nLiberty Costa Rica.................... 147.2 135.2 9 4 299.5 264.4 13 6\nCorporate .................................. 5.9 5.6 5 5 11.0 12.0 (8) (8)\nEliminations...............................

Rebased performance was driven by ARPU growth mainly due to price increases\nacross a number of markets, and supported by broadband subscriber growth, primarily in\nJamaica.\n◦ Mobile residential revenue increased by 4% on a reported basis and by 5% on a rebased\nbasis. Performance resulted from an increase in postpaid subscribers year-over-year\ndriven by our fixed-mobile convergence propositions and higher prepaid ARPU following\nprice increases.\n◦ B2B revenue was 5% higher on both a reported and rebased basis. Growth was driven\nby higher project-related revenue.\n• C&W Panama: revenue grew by 9% on a reported and rebased basis, year-over-year.\n◦ Fixed residential revenue was up 4%, driven by broadband RGU additions following\nexpansion of our FTTH networks, products and commercial activities.\n◦ Mobile residential revenue grew by 4%, driven by improved prepaid ARPU as our\nproducts and promotions led to increased recharge activity. This was partly offset by\ndecreases in prepaid mobile subscribers over the past twelve months, driven by the net\nimpact of (i) churn related to the migration of customers to our network following the\n4\nClaro Panama Acquisition, and (ii) the addition of customers to our base following the\nexit of a competitor from our market.\n◦ B2B revenue increased by 17% primarily due to increased revenue from government-\nrelated projects.\n• Liberty Networks: revenue was flat and declined by 1% on a reported and rebased basis,\nrespectively. The year-over-year rebased decline was driven by lower wholesale network\nrevenue associated with a reduction of $6 million in non-cash IRU revenue primarily due to\nlower amortization year-over-year. This was partly offset by higher enterprise revenue due to\ncontinued growth in managed services and B2B connectivity.\n• Liberty Puerto Rico: revenue was 12% lower on a reported and rebased basis, year-over-year.\n◦ Residential fixed revenue was broadly stable year-over-year, declining by 1%, as\nbroadband subscriber additions over the past twelve months were more than offset by\nlower ARPU, primarily due to retention discounts, including for customers previously\nreceiving subsidized services through the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP).\n◦ Residential mobile revenue was 21% lower compared to the prior-year period. This was\ndriven by a reduction in mobile subscribers, impacted by disruption related to the\nmigration of customers to our mobile network and a reduction in roaming revenue.\n◦ B2B revenue declined by 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the cancellation of the\nFCC's Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) which led to a reduction of 74,000 mobile\npostpaid subs over the past year.\n◦ Other revenue declined by $4 million as compared to the prior-year quarter due to a\nreduction in revenue recognized on funds received from the FCC.\n• Liberty Costa Rica: revenue grew by 9% on a reported basis and 4% on a rebased basis, year-\nover-year. Reported performance benefited from a $7 million positive foreign exchange impact\nas the Costa Rican colon appreciated against the U.S. dollar. The strong year-over-year\nrebased performance was driven by higher mobile revenue due to increased equipment sales\nand postpaid subscriber growth.\nOperating Income\n• Operating income was $111 million and $135 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and $204 million and $242 million for the six months ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\n◦ We reported lower operating income during the three and six months ended June 30,\n2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to the net impact\nof (i) declines in Adjusted OIBDA and (ii) decreases in impairment, restructuring and\nother operating items, net.\n5\nAdjusted OIBDA Highlights\nThe following table presents (i) Adjusted OIBDA of each of our reportable segments and our corporate\ncategory for the periods indicated and (ii) the percentage change from period-to-period on both a\nreported and rebased basis:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30, Increase (decrease) June 30, Increase (decrease)\n2024 2023 % Rebased % 2024 2023 % Rebased %\nin millions, except % amounts\nC&W Caribbean.................................. $ 157.0 $ 146.3 7 8 $ 307.6 $ 286.5 7 8\nC&W Panama...................................... 64.8 59.0 10 10 121.6 102.5 19 19\nLiberty Networks ................................. 63.1 72.2 (13) (13) 122.3 135.8 (10) (10)\nLiberty Puerto Rico............................. 71.1 137.2 (48) (48) 140.2 265.2 (47) (47)\nLiberty Costa Rica .............................. 53.4 50.1 7 1 111.7 95.3 17 10\nCorporate.............................................

Our Adjusted OIBDA margin improved by over 150 basis points year-over-year to\n42.6%.\n• C&W Panama: Adjusted OIBDA increased by 10% on both a reported and rebased basis, driven\nby the aforementioned revenue growth.\n• Liberty Networks: Adjusted OIBDA decreased by 13% on both a reported and rebased basis.\nOur rebased performance was driven primarily by the aforementioned non-cash related revenue\ndecline in the quarter, and higher bad debt expense mostly driven by adjustments for two large\ncustomers.\n• Liberty Puerto Rico: Adjusted OIBDA declined by 48% on a reported and rebased basis. The\nperformance was driven by the net impact of: (i) our aforementioned revenue decline, (ii) lower\ndirect costs, primarily due to lower TSA and roaming costs, and (iii) higher other operating costs\nmainly related to (a) migration activities, including a $12 million increase in bad debt expense\nrelated to billing and collection issues, (b) higher information technology service and license\nexpenses, as we transitioned mobile customers to our internal systems and (c) an $8 million\n6\ncredit related to the CARES Act received in the prior-year period. TSA, integration and inventory\ncosts related to the migration were $16 million in the quarter.\n• Liberty Costa Rica: Adjusted OIBDA grew by 7% and 1% on a reported and rebased basis,\nrespectively. Rebased performance was driven by the aforementioned revenue growth and\nfavorable foreign exchange movements on non-CRC denominated costs, partly offset by higher\noperating costs related to sales activity.\nNet Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders\n• Net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders was ($43 million) for each of the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, and $35 million and ($31 million) for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023, respectively.\n7\nProperty & Equipment Additions and Capital Expenditures\nThe table below highlights the categories of the property and equipment additions (P&E Additions) for\nthe indicated periods and reconciles to cash paid for capital expenditures, net.\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSD in millions\nCustomer Premises Equipment............................................................................ $ 46.0 $ 44.6 $ 87.3 $ 91.5\nNew Build & Upgrade............................................................................................. 43.7 34.6 67.7 62.6\nCapacity................................................................................................................... 26.1 26.2 49.6 45.6\nBaseline.................................................................................................................... 52.1 69.3 90.0 108.7\nProduct & Enablers................................................................................................ 11.7 17.7 19.9 28.7\nProperty & equipment additions...................................................................... 179.6 192.4 314.5 337.1\nAssets acquired under capital-related vendor financing arrangements.........

ARPU per average customer relationship is calculated by dividing the average\nmonthly subscription revenue from residential fixed and SOHO fixed services by the average of the opening and closing balances for customer relationships for\nthe indicated period. ARPU per average mobile subscriber is calculated by dividing the average monthly mobile service revenue by the average of the opening\nand closing balances for mobile subscribers for the indicated period. Unless otherwise indicated, ARPU per customer relationship or mobile subscriber is not\nadjusted for currency impacts. ARPU per average RGU is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from the applicable residential fixed\nservice by the average of the opening and closing balances of the applicable RGUs for the indicated period. Unless otherwise noted, ARPU in this release is\nconsidered to be ARPU per average customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. Customer relationships, mobile subscribers and RGUs of entities\nacquired during the period are normalized.\nConsolidated Debt and Finance Lease Obligations to Operating Income Ratio – Defined as total principal amount of debt outstanding (including liabilities\nrelated to vendor financing, debt related to the Tower Transactions, other debt and finance lease obligations) to annualized operating income from the most\nrecent two consecutive fiscal quarters.\nConsolidated Net Debt and Finance Lease Obligations to Operating Income Ratio – Defined as total principal amount of debt outstanding (including\nliabilities related to vendor financing, debt related to the Tower Transactions, other debt and finance lease obligations) less cash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash related to debt to annualized operating income from the most recent two consecutive fiscal quarters.\nCRU – Corporate responsible user.\nCustomer Relationships – The number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as RGUs, without\nregard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include equivalent billing unit (“EBU”) adjustments, we reflect\ncorresponding adjustments to our customer relationship counts. For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes below.\nCustomer relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary\nhome and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two customer relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from customer relationships.\nFully-swapped Borrowing Cost – Represents the weighted average interest rate on our debt (excluding finance leases and including vendor financing\nobligations, debt related to the Tower Transactions and other debt), including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums or discounts, which\nincludes a discount on the convertible notes issued by Liberty Latin America associated with a conversion option feature, and commitment fees, but excluding\nthe impact of financing costs.\nHomes Passed – Homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the\ndistribution plant. Certain of our homes passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census\nresults.\nInternet (Broadband) RGU – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our network.\nLeverage – Our gross and net leverage ratios, each a non-GAAP measure, are defined as total debt (total principal amount of debt outstanding, including\nliabilities related to vendor financing, debt related to the Tower Transactions, other debt and finance lease obligations, net of projected derivative principal-related\ncash payments (receipts)) and net debt to annualized Adjusted OIBDA of the latest two quarters. Net debt is defined as total debt (including the convertible notes\nand liabilities related to vendor financing and finance lease obligations) less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash related to debt. For purposes of these\ncalculations, debt is measured using swapped foreign currency rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our subsidiary debt agreements.\n21\nMobile Subscribers – Our mobile subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (“SIM”) cards in service rather than services\nprovided. For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively, a\nsubscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two mobile subscribers.\nCustomers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile telephony subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90\ndays, based on industry standards within the respective country. In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid\ncontracts. Our Liberty Puerto Rico segment prepaid subscriber count includes mobile reseller subscribers, which represent organizations that purchase minutes\nand data at wholesale prices and subsequently resell it under the purchaser's brand name. These reseller subscribers result in a significantly lower ARPU than\nthe remaining subscribers included in our prepaid balance. Additionally, our Liberty Puerto Rico segment postpaid subscriber count includes CRUs, which\nrepresent an individual receiving mobile services through an organization that has entered into a contract for mobile services with us and where the organization\nis responsible for the payment of the CRU’s mobile services.\nNPS – Net promoter score.\nProperty and Equipment Addition Categories\n• Customer Premises Equipment: Includes capitalizable equipment and labor, materials and other costs directly associated with the installation of such CPE;\n• New Build & Upgrade: Includes capitalizable costs of network equipment, materials, labor and other costs directly associated with entering a new service\narea and upgrading our existing network;\n• Capacity: Includes capitalizable costs for network capacity required for growth and services expansions from both existing and new customers. This category\ncovers Core and Access parts of the network and includes, for example, fiber node splits, upstream/downstream spectrum upgrades and optical equipment\nadditions in our international backbone connections;\n• Baseline: Includes capitalizable costs of equipment, materials, labor and other costs directly associated with maintaining and supporting the business.\nRelates to areas such as network improvement, property and facilities, technical sites, information technology systems and fleet; and\n• Product & Enablers: Discretionary capitalizable costs that include investments (i) required to support, maintain, launch or innovate in new customer products,\nand (ii) in infrastructure, which drive operational efficiency over the long term.\nProportionate Net Leverage Ratio (C&W) – Calculated in accordance with C&W's Credit Agreement, taking into account the ratio of outstanding indebtedness\n(subject to certain exclusions) less cash and cash equivalents to EBITDA (subject to certain adjustments) for the last two quarters annualized, with both\nindebtedness and EBITDA reduced proportionately to remove any noncontrolling interests' share of the C&W group.\nRevenue Generating Unit (RGU) – RGU is separately a video RGU, internet RGU or telephony RGU. A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial\nunit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in Puerto Rico subscribed to our video service, fixed-line telephony service and\nbroadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. RGUs are generally counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises\ndoes not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary\nhome and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled video, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate\nRGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as RGUs during their free promotional service period.\nSome of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers\nor free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In\nthis regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.\nSOHO – Small office/home office customers.\nTelephony RGU – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our network. Telephony RGUs exclude mobile\nsubscribers.\n22\nTower Transactions – Transactions entered into during 2023 associated with certain of our mobile towers across various markets that (i) have terms of 15 or 20\nyears and did not meet the criteria to be accounted for as a sale and leaseback and (ii) also include \"build to suit\" sites that we are obligated to construct over the\nnext 5 years.\nU.S. GAAP – Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nVideo RGU – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our network, primarily via a digital video signal\nwhile subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Video RGUs that are not counted on an EBU basis\nare generally counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is\ngenerally counted as just one RGU.\nAdditional General Notes\nMost of our operations provide telephony, broadband internet, mobile data, video or other B2B services. Certain of our B2B service revenue is derived from\nSOHO customers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the\nmass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHO customers, whether or not accompanied by\nenhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our operations, with only those services provided at\npremium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers.” To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a\nSOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs and SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the\nexception of our B2B SOHO customers, we generally do not count customers of B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.\nCertain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential multiple dwelling units and commercial establishments, such\nas bars, hotels, and hospitals, in Puerto Rico. Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent\nprice charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely\nas a result of changes in rates.\nWhile we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber and homes passed statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance\nsheet date, the variability from country to country in (i) the nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems, (iv) bad\ndebt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber and homes passed counting process. We periodically review our subscriber and\nhomes passed counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we\nmay from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber and homes passed statistics based on those reviews.\n23\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nWe include certain financial measures in this press release that are considered non-GAAP measures,\nincluding (i) Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin, each on a consolidated basis, (ii) Adjusted Free\nCash Flow, (iii) rebased revenue and rebased Adjusted OIBDA growth rates, and (iv) consolidated leverage\nratios. The following sections set forth reconciliations of the nearest GAAP measure to our non-GAAP\nmeasures, as well as information on how and why management of the Company believes such information is\nuseful to an investor.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nOn a consolidated basis, Adjusted OIBDA, a non-GAAP measure, is the primary measure used by our chief\noperating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance. Adjusted OIBDA is also a key factor\nthat is used by our internal decision makers to determine how to allocate resources to segments. As we use\nthe term, Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income or loss before share-based compensation and\nother Employee Incentive Plan-related expense, depreciation and amortization, provisions and provision\nreleases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other\noperating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs\ndirectly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory\nand due diligence fees, as applicable, and (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on\nthe settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted OIBDA is a\nmeaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is\nunaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (i) readily view operating trends, (ii) perform\nanalytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (iii) identify strategies to improve\noperating performance in the different countries in which we operate. We believe our Adjusted OIBDA\nmeasure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the\nperformance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly\ncomparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted OIBDA should be viewed as a\nmeasure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss,\nnet earnings or loss and other U.S. GAAP measures of income. A reconciliation of our operating income or\nloss to total Adjusted OIBDA is presented in the following table:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nin millions\nOperating income.................................................................................................................. $ 110.8 $ 135.4 $ 203.6 $ 242.0\nShare-based compensation and other Employee Incentive Plan-related expense1.. 16.0 24.5 43.0 53.7\nDepreciation and amortization............................................................................................ 236.7 240.5 484.5 475.1\nImpairment, restructuring and other operating items, net............................................... 25.6 40.8 32.2 70.5\nAdjusted OIBDA................................................................................................................. $ 389.1 $ 441.2 $ 763.3 $ 841.3\nOperating income margin2................................................................................................... 9.9 % 12.1 % 9.2 % 10.9 %\nAdjusted OIBDA margin3...................................................................................................... 34.8 % 39.4 % 34.4 % 37.9 %\n1.

Calculated by dividing operating income by total revenue for the applicable period.\n3. Calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue for the applicable period.\n24\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Definition and Reconciliation\nWe define Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted FCF), a non-GAAP measure, as net cash provided by our\noperating activities, plus (i) cash payments for third-party costs directly associated with successful and\nunsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, (ii) expenses financed by an intermediary, (iii) proceeds received\nin connection with handset receivables securitization, (iv) insurance recoveries related to damaged and\ndestroyed property and equipment and (v) certain net interest payments or receipts incurred or received,\nincluding associated derivative instrument payments and receipts, in advance of a significant acquisition,\nless (a) capital expenditures, net, (b) principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and\nintermediaries, (c) principal payments on finance leases, (d) repayments made associated with a handset\nreceivables securitization, and (e) distributions to noncontrolling interest owners. We believe that our\npresentation of Adjusted FCF provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used\nto gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities. Adjusted FCF should not be\nunderstood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and\ncontractual obligations, including debt repayments, which are not deducted to arrive at this amount.\nInvestors should view Adjusted FCF as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of\nliquidity included in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following table provides the reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted\nFCF for the indicated period:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nin millions\nNet cash provided by operating activities ........................................................... $ 156.9 $ 225.6 $ 180.2 $ 288.0\nCash payments for direct acquisition and disposition costs ........................... 2.5 2.1 3.3 3.5\nExpenses financed by an intermediary1.............................................................. 48.6 52.6 80.8 93.9\nCapital expenditures, net.......................................................................................

For purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows, expenses, including value-added taxes, financed by an intermediary\nare treated as operating cash outflows and financing cash inflows when the expenses are incurred. When we pay the financing\nintermediary, we record financing cash outflows in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. For purposes of our\nAdjusted FCF definition, we add back the operating cash outflows when these financed expenses are incurred and deduct the\nfinancing cash outflows when we pay the financing intermediary.\n25\nRebase Information\nRebase growth rates are a non-GAAP measure. For purposes of calculating rebased growth rates, we reflect\nthe translation of our prior-year results at the applicable average foreign currency exchange rates that were\nused to translate our results for the corresponding current-year period.\nThe rebased growth percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue and Adjusted OIBDA that will\noccur in the future. The rebased growth percentages have been presented as a basis for assessing growth\nrates on a comparable basis and should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a\nsupplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP reported growth rates.\nThe following tables provide the aforementioned adjustments made to the revenue and Adjusted OIBDA\namounts for the periods indicated, to derive our rebased growth rates. Due to rounding, certain rebased\ngrowth rate percentages may not recalculate.\nIn the tables set forth below:\n• reported percentage changes are calculated as current period measure, as applicable, less prior-\nperiod measure divided by prior-period measure; and\n• rebased percentage changes are calculated as current period measure, as applicable, less rebased\nprior-period measure divided by rebased prior-period measure.\nThe following tables set forth the reconciliation from reported revenue to rebased revenue and related\nchange calculations.\nThree months ended June 30, 2023\nLiberty Liberty\nC&W C&W Liberty Puerto Costa Intersegment\nCaribbean Panama Networks Rico Rica Corporate eliminations Total\nIn millions\nRevenue – Reported................................. $ 356.3 $ 180.8 $ 118.6 $ 349.5 $ 135.2 $ 5.6 $ (25.8) $ 1,120.2\nRebase adjustment:\nForeign currency.....................................

Our consolidated leverage and\nnet leverage ratios (Consolidated Leverage Ratios), each a non-GAAP measure, are defined as (i) the\nprincipal amount of debt and finance lease obligations less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\nrelated to debt divided by (ii) last two quarters of annualized Adjusted OIBDA. We generally use Adjusted\nOIBDA for the last two quarters annualized when calculating our Consolidated Leverage Ratios to maintain\nas much consistency as possible with the calculations established by our debt covenants included in the\ncredit facilities or bond indentures for our respective borrowing groups, which are predominantly determined\non a last two quarters annualized basis. For purposes of these calculations, adjusted total debt and finance\nlease obligations is measured using swapped foreign currency rates. We believe our consolidated leverage\nand net leverage ratios are useful because they allow our investors to consider the aggregate leverage on\nthe business inclusive of any leverage at the Liberty Latin America level, not just at each of our operations.\nInvestors should view consolidated leverage and net leverage as supplements to, and not substitutes for, the\nratios calculated based upon measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of the\nnumerator and denominator used to calculate the consolidated leverage and net leverage ratios as of\nJune 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 are set forth below:\nJune 30, March 31,\n2024 2024\nin millions, except leverage ratios\nTotal debt and finance lease obligations..................................................................................................... $ 8,080.7 $ 8,056.0\nDiscounts, premiums and deferred financing costs, net........................................................................... 55.6 60.4\nAdjusted total debt and finance lease obligations......................................................................... 8,136.3 8,116.4\nLess:\nCash and cash equivalents......................................................................................................................... 598.6 668.5\nRestricted cash related to debt1................................................................................................................. 13.0 8.0\nNet debt and finance lease obligations............................................................................................. $ 7,524.7 $ 7,439.9\nOperating income2:\nOperating income for the three months ended December 31, 2023....................................................

Amount relates to restricted cash at Liberty Puerto Rico that serves as collateral against certain letters of credit associated with\nthe funding received from the FCC to continue to expand and improve our fixed network in Puerto Rico.\n29\n2. Operating income or loss is the closest U.S. GAAP measure to Adjusted OIBDA, as discussed in Adjusted OIBDA above.\nAccordingly, we have presented consolidated debt and finance lease obligations to operating income and consolidated net debt\nand finance lease obligations to operating income as the most directly comparable financial ratios to our non-GAAP consolidated\nleverage and consolidated net leverage ratios.\n3. Adjusted OIBDA is a non-GAAP measure. See Adjusted OIBDA above for reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to the nearest U.S.\nGAAP measure for the three months ended June 30, 2024. A reconciliation of our operating income to Adjusted OIBDA for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is presented in the following table:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nin millions\nOperating income.................................................................................................................. $ 92.8 $ 113.0\nShare-based compensation and other Employee Incentive Plan-related expense.... 27.0 10.9\nDepreciation and amortization............................................................................................ 247.8 302.7\nImpairment, restructuring and other operating items, net............................................... 6.6 5.3\nAdjusted OIBDA.................................................................................................................. $ 374.2 $ 431.9\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations for Our Borrowing Groups\nThe financial statements of each of our borrowing groups are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We\ninclude certain financial measures for our C&W, Liberty Puerto Rico and Liberty Costa Rica borrowing\ngroups in this press release that are considered non-GAAP measures, including: (i) Adjusted OIBDA; (ii)\nAdjusted OIBDA Margin; (iii) Proportionate Adjusted OIBDA, (iv) rebased revenue and (v) rebased Adjusted\nOIBDA.\nAdjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income or loss before share-based compensation and other\nEmployee Incentive Plan-related expense, depreciation and amortization, related-party fees and allocations,\nprovisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other\noperating items. Proportionate Adjusted OIBDA is defined as Adjusted OIBDA less the noncontrolling\ninterests' share of Adjusted OIBDA. We believe these measures at the borrowing group level are useful to\ninvestors because they are one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other\ncompanies in the same or similar industries, although our measures may not be directly comparable to\nsimilar measures used by other public companies. These measures should be viewed as measures of\noperating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net\nearnings or loss and other U.S. GAAP measures of income.\n30\nA reconciliation of C&W's operating income to Adjusted OIBDA and Proportionate Adjusted OIBDA is\npresented in the following table:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30, June
