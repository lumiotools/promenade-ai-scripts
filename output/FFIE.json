(NASDAQ: FFIE) (“Faraday Future,” “FF,” or “the Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, announced today that it plans to change its Nasdaq ticker symbol from “FFIE” to “FFAI” in early 2025. This change aligns with the Company’s continued focus on its AI strategy that includes its new FX brand strategy. Surveys conducted over the past year also consistently showed a preference for changing the ticker symbol from \"FFIE\" to \"FFAI.\" The Company plans to announce the date and detailed plans for the official stock ticker symbol change and “FF AI Open Day” in January 2025. \n\n“Since its establishment, AI has been an FF cornerstone,” said Matthias Aydt, Global CEO of Faraday Future. “The stock ticker ‘FFAI’ better reflects the Company’s strategic direction. With FF’s AI technology empowering the FX strategy and the gradual implementation of this strategy, we aim to create AIEVs with extreme price-experience ratio, addressing gaps in the U.S. AIEV market, including AI cabins. Our goal is to drive the comprehensive AI transformation of the U.S. EV industry.” \n\n**FF’s All-AI Technology Architecture to push the boundaries of AIEV**\n\nSince its founding, FF has recognized that intelligent electric vehicles are not merely tools for transportation but dynamic, evolving “mobile robots.” FF has always believed that its foundation is in AI technologies. \n\nAI is at the core of the FF aiHyper 6x4 Architecture 2.0. By leveraging specialized large AI models in the mobility sector, FF AI aims to achieve complete AI integration through cross-domain computing, algorithms, and data, along with end-to-end full-chain integration. This enables a fully integrated AI-driven technology structure, where the four major AI engines empower the four technology systems and six technology platforms. \n\n**Magic All-In-One** **AI Engine** is powered by a multi-modal large model driven by visual language models (VLMs), aiming at integrating road pre-scanning, cloud data, and vehicle sensors to deliver the ultimate driving experience. \n\n**Hyper Multi-Vectoring AI engine** could leverage large AI models to enable AI-driven control of steering, braking, and power delivery, aiming to unleash the vehicle's Hyper performance through AI technology. \n\n**The 3rd aiSpace** **AI Engine** leverages proprietary large-scale models specifically designed for mobility, delivering comprehensive intelligent services by seamlessly integrating end-to-end computation, algorithms, and cross-domain data. \n\n**FF aiDriving** **AI Engine** utilizes a large VLM to achieve deep integration of vision, language, speech, and historical data to make every journey safe, intelligent, and enjoyable. \n\nBy integrating data from the mobility ecosystem and incorporating third-party general-purpose large models alongside proprietary large-scale models tailored for mobility, the FF AI platform aims to push the boundaries of AIEV technologies and pave the way for an open, collaborative, and mutually beneficial future mobility ecosystem. \n\nThe FX strategy presents an excellent opportunity for the application and evolution of the Company’s AI strategy. FF’s AI capabilities are planned to empower the FX brand through iterative innovation, enabling AI to consistently redefine the mobility experience. \n\n**Comprehensive AI Strategy Could Deliver Multi-Dimensional Value for Users, Partners and Industry**\n\nFF’s AI strategy includes introducing new revenue streams, such as in-vehicle subscriptions and AI-driven value-added services. These innovations could also enhance user loyalty and recognition. \n\nFor users, FF and FX products could act as “intelligent partners,” with product design centered on natural interaction methods, including voice and gesture controls. These features would deliver intuitive, seamless interactions that continuously improve through learning, offering personalized AI experiences. \n\nThrough its “AI-First” approach and co-creation ecosystem, FF is driving the evolution of cars from traditional vehicles to intelligent mobile devices, setting new benchmarks for future smart vehicles. By fostering collaboration with global developers and AI experts, FF aims to propel industry-wide innovation, benefiting the sector and its partners. \n\n**ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE**\n\nFaraday Future is the pioneer of the Ultimate AI TechLuxury ultra spire market in the intelligent EV era, and the disruptor of the traditional ultra-luxury car civilization epitomized by Ferrari and Maybach.
