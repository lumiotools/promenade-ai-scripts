Nature of Operations\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the province of British Columbia on\nJune 24, 1987. The Company is a reporting issuer in each of the Provinces and Territories of Canada and\nis listed for trading on the TSXV, under the symbol “HIVE.V”, as well on the Nasdaq’s Capital Markets\nExchange under “HIVE”, and on the Open Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under “YO0.F”. On July\n12, 2023 the Company completed a name change from HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. to HIVE Digital\nTechnologies Ltd. The Company’s head office is located at Suite 370, 1095 West Pender Street,\nVancouver, BC, V6E 2M6, and the Company’s registered office is located at Suite 2500, 700 West Georgia\nStreet, Vancouver, BC, V7Y 1B3.\nIn connection with the Company’s change of business filed in September 2017 (“Change of Business”), the\nCompany acquired data center equipment in Iceland. Following the initial acquisition, the Company\nacquired additional data center equipment in Iceland and Sweden throughout fiscal 2018. Phases one and\ntwo of Sweden commenced operations on January 15, 2018 and March 31, 2018 respectively, while phase\nthree commenced operations on April 30, 2018. On April 9, 2020 the Company acquired a data center in\nQuebec, Canada, and on April 15, 2021 the Company acquired a data center in New Brunswick, Canada.\nThe Company is in the business of providing infrastructure solutions, including the provision of\ncomputational capacity to distributed networks, in the blockchain industry. The Company’s operations are\nfocused on the mining of digital currencies to upgrade, expand and scale up its data center operations.\nDigital currencies are subject to risks unique to the asset class and different from traditional assets.\nAdditionally, the Company may at times hold assets with third party custodians or exchanges that are limited\nin oversight by regulatory authorities.\nOn May 24, 2023, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Bikupa Real Estate AB, to function\nas a holding entity to facilitate the acquisition of a data center. On July 5, 2024, the Company incorporated\na wholly owned subsidiary, Paraguay Digital Ltd., to function as a holding entity to facilitate data center\ndevelopment and infrastructure in Paraguay.\n2. Basis of Presentation and Material Accounting Policy Information\n(a) Statement of Compliance\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance\nwith IAS 34, “Interim Financial Reporting of the International Financial Reporting Standards” (“IFRS\nAccounting Standards”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and follow the\nsame accounting policies and methods of application as the Company’s March 31, 2024, annual audited\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements\ndo not include all the information required for full annual financial statements and accordingly, they should\nbe read in conjunction with the Company’s most recent annual statements.\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a cost basis except for\nthe convertible loan - derivative component and digital assets that have been measured at fair value. In\naddition, these condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accrual\nbasis of accounting, except for cash flow information. The condensed interim consolidated financial\nstatements are presented in United States dollars (“US dollars” or “$”), except where otherwise indicated.\nThe Company is in the business of the mining and sale of digital currencies to upgrade, expand, and scale\nup its mining operations, many aspects of which are not specifically addressed by IFRS Accounting\nStandards.\nPage 5\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n2. Basis of Presentation and Material Accounting Policies (continued…)\n(a) Statement of Compliance (continued...)\nThe Company is required to use certain critical accounting estimates and make judgements as to the\napplication of IFRS Accounting Standards and the selection of accounting policies. The Company has\ndisclosed its presentation, recognition and de-recognition, and measurement of digital currencies, and the\nrecognition of revenue as well as significant assumptions and judgements; however, if specific guidance is\nenacted in the future, the impact may result in changes to the Company’s earnings and financial position\nas presented.\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for\nissuance by the Board of Directors on November 12, 2024.\n(b) New Accounting Standards Adopted by the Company\nAmendment to IAS 1 – Non-current liabilities with covenants\nThese amendments clarify how conditions with which an entity must comply within twelve months after the\nreporting period affect the classification of a liability. The amendments also aim to improve information an\nentity provides related to liabilities subject to these conditions. These amendments are effective for annual\nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\nAmendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\nIn January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or\nNon-current. These amendments clarify the requirements relating to determining if a liability should be\npresented as current or non-current in the statement of financial position. Pursuant to the new requirements,\nthe assessment of whether a liability is presented as current or non-current is based on the contractual\narrangements in place as at the reporting date and does not impact the amount or timing of recognition.\nThese amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early\napplication permitted.\nAmendment to IFRS 16 – Leases on sale and leaseback\nThese amendments include requirements for sale and leaseback transactions in IFRS 16 to explain how\nan entity accounts for a sale and leaseback after the date of the transaction. Sale and leaseback\ntransactions where some or all the lease payments are variable lease payments that do not depend on an\nindex or rate are most likely to be impacted. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning\non or after 1 January 2024.\nThe adoption of the amendments listed above did not have a significant impact on the Company’s\ncondensed interim consolidated financial statements.\nPage 6\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n2. Basis of Presentation and Material Accounting Policies (continued…)\n(c) Future Accounting Standards\nAmendments to IAS 21 - Lack of Exchangeability\nAn entity is impacted by the amendments when it has a transaction or an operation in a foreign currency\nthat is not exchangeable into another currency at a measurement date for a specified purpose. A currency\nis exchangeable when there is an ability to obtain the other currency (with a normal administrative delay),\nand the transaction would take place through a market or exchange mechanism that creates enforceable\nrights and obligations. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2025 (early adoption is available).\nPresentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (“IFRS 18”)\nThe IASB issued IFRS 18 standard on presentation and disclosure in financial statements which will replace\nIAS 1, with a focus on updates to the statement of profit or loss. The key new concepts introduced in IFRS\n18 relate to:\n• the structure of the statement of profit or loss, including specified totals and subtotals;\n• required disclosures in the financial statements for certain profit or loss performance measures that\nare reported outside an entity’s financial statements; and\n• enhanced principles on aggregation and disaggregation which apply to the primary financial\nstatements and notes in general.\nIFRS 18 was issued in April 2024 and applies to an annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January\n2027.\nThe Company continues to review changes to IFRS Accounting Standards and the impact to the Company’s\ncondensed interim consolidated financial statements.\n3. Significant Estimates and Judgements\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements necessitates\nmanagement to make various judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the recognition and\nmeasurement of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. These judgments and estimates are based on\nmanagement's best understanding of future events, circumstances, and potential actions taken by the\nCompany. It should be noted that the actual results may deviate from these assumptions and estimates.\nThe assessments and underlying assumptions are regularly reviewed. If any revisions are made to the\nassumptions or estimates and they only affect the current period, they are recognized in that particular\nperiod. However, if the revisions impact both the current and future periods, they are recognized in the\nperiod of the revision and in subsequent periods.\nThe significant judgments made by management while applying the Company's accounting policies and the\nprimary sources of estimation uncertainty remain consistent with those outlined in the audited annual\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.\nPage 7\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n4. Asset Acquisition\nOn November 29, 2023, the Company acquired a data center in Sweden. In consideration, the Company\nissued 345,566 common shares of the Company to the vendor, made a cash payment totalling $647 and\n$500 in holdback common shares payable that are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as\nat September 30, 2024 (Note 11). The Company also incurred $141 in acquisition costs which were\ncapitalized to the cost of the assets.\nThe $500 in holdback common shares payable shall be paid at the later of: (i) the six month anniversary of\nthe closing date; and (ii) the date on which any claims made by the Company within six months of the\nclosing date relating to a breach of warranty under the property transfer agreement have been finally settled,\nand shall be composed of such number of Common Shares equal to $500 less any amount payable by the\nVendor to the Company in respect of such claim. As of the date of this document, the holdback common\nshares have not been paid out.\nThe Company determined that this transaction is an asset acquisition as the assets acquired did not\nconstitute a business as defined by IFRS 3. The following table summarizes the consideration transferred,\nthe estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as the date of the\nacquisition:\nPage 8\nCSHAT\nLBEVTCN\nahoco\nauqAoue\ns h pa\nr e sld\nb aq\nu ist\na l c\nn dild\ninu\nip mT\nr eta\nl ar\nr e nt\na s\na id\nis s u e dc\nk p a y a b leitio\nn c o s tso\nn s id e r a t io\ng\ne n tc\ne iv a b le ss\ns e tst\nlia b ilitie ss\ne t s a c q u ir e\nn\nd\n$ 6 4\n1 ,0 8\n5 0\n1 4$\n2 ,3 7\n$ 8\n1 ,5 8\n4 4\n3 6\n2 ,4 7\n( 1 0$\n2 ,3 7\n78016\n6760936\n)\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n5. Investments\nAs at September 30, 2024 the Company holds a number of investments in both private and public\ncompanies. The Company’s investment holdings that are not traded in active markets by the Company are\nconsidered investments. Investments are accounted for as financial assets which are initially recognized\nat fair value and subsequently measured through fair value through profit or loss.\nThe continuity of investments was as follows:\nInvestments\nBalance, March 31, 2023 $ 2,866\nAdditions 341\nUnrealized gain on investments 3,743\nForeign exchange 24\nBalance, March 31, 2024 $ 6,974\nAdditions 1,128\nUnrealized gain on investments 16,115\nForeign exchange 229\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ 24,446\n6. Amounts Receivable and Prepaids\n* Receivable is conditional upon ruling by the by the Swedish Tax Authority related to an ongoing value\nadded tax process. If the ruling is favourable, amounts will be received, otherwise, the amounts will not\nbe collectible. Management has assessed the collectability using a probability model under a range of\nscenarios and this receivable reflects the results of that process.\n** During the year ended March 31, 2024, after examination of the history of claims and payments received\nfrom various authorities, together with regulatory challenges, the Company assessed the collectability of\nits sales tax receivable balance. As a result, the Company determined that there is uncertainty over the\ncollection of certain amounts, and recorded a provision of $4.5 million for these receivables. During the\nperiod ended September 30, 2024, an additional provision was recognized of $0.3 million and the\nCompany recovered $0.8 million in relation to the provision of $4.5 million and reversed an additional $0.5\nmillion of the same provision as a result of further examination of the sales tax provision amounts. The\nCompany also received an assessment of $2.3 million for sales tax payable that is included in the\nprovision as a result of a sales tax audit related to periods prior to the acquisition of 9376-9974 Quebec\nInc. in 2021, and the recovered amount of $0.8 million has been applied against the sales tax payable.\nPage 9\nSPRA\nPARFPL\nL\na le s ta x r e c e iv a b le * *r\ne p a id e x p e n s e s a n d o th e r r e c e iv ae\nc e iv a b le o n s a le o f s u b s id ia r y *m\no u n ts r e c e iv a b le a n d p r e p a id s ( g\nr o v is io n a n d lia b ility o n s a le s ta x r ed\nd itio n se\nc o v e r y a n d r e v e r s a lo\nr e ig n e x c h a n g er\no v is io n o n s a le s ta x r e c e iv a b lee\ns s : c u r r e n t p o r tio n fo r r e c e iv a b le s\no n g t e r m p o r t io n\nb le s\nr o s s\nc e iv\na n d\n)\na b\np\nle\nr e\n, o\np a\np\nid\ne\ns\nn in g\nS e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2$\n8 ,4\n5 ,4\n1 ,8$\n1 5 ,6\n$ ( 6 ,7\n( 3\n1 ,2\n( 5$\n( 6 ,3$\n( 6 ,6\n$ 2 ,6\n00719\n717675\n6\n29166\n706784\n4\n4\n))\n)))\nM a r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 4$\n6 ,8 1 8\n7 ,6 6 7\n1 ,8 1 6$\n1 6 ,3 0 1\n$ -\n( 6 ,7 7 7 )\n-\n-$\n( 6 ,7 7 7 )$\n( 6 ,9 2 9 )\n$ 2 ,5 9 5\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n7.

Deposits (continued…)\n*During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered a 100MW power supply agreement\nwith the National Administration of Electricity (“ANDE”) in Paraguay. The Company paid $3.4 million security\ndeposit for one month of estimated consumption of electric energy and power per terms of the agreement.\nThe Company has a commitment to pay for another two months of estimated consumption before sixty\ncalendar days from the start of the supply or within 12 months following the signing of the power supply\nagreement, whichever, occurs first. In addition, the Company will need to provide a real guarantee, valid\nuntil April 1, 2028, for an amount equivalent to two months of estimated consumption of electric energy and\npower within 12 months of signing the power supply agreement. These commitment amounts are included\nin Note 15(c) and are refundable to the Company after the agreement has concluded and the sums resulting\nfrom the final statement of account from ANDE are settled.\n10. Convertible Loan\nOn January 12, 2021, the Company closed its non-brokered private placement of unsecured debentures\n(the “Debentures”), for aggregate gross proceeds of $15 million with U.S. Global Investors, Inc. (“U.S.\nGlobal”). The Executive Chairman of the Company is a director, officer and controlling shareholder of U.S.\nGlobal.\nThe Debentures mature on the date that is 60 months from the date of issuance, bearing interest at a rate\nof 8% per annum. The Debentures will be issued at par, with each Debenture being redeemable by the\nCompany at any time, and convertible at the option of the holder into common shares (each, a “Share”) in\nthe capital of the Company at a conversion price of C$15 per Share. Interest will be payable monthly and\nthe principal will be payable quarterly. In addition, U.S. Global was issued 5 million common share purchase\nwarrants (the “Warrants”). Each five whole Warrant entitles U.S. Global to acquire one common at an\nexercise price of C$15 per Share for a period of three years from closing. The Warrants expired unexercised\non January 12, 2024.\nThe Company determined that the Convertible Loan contained an embedded derivative, and that the\nconversion feature does not qualify as equity as it does not satisfy the “fixed for fixed” requirement as the\nnumber of potential common shares to be issued is contingent on a variable carrying amount for the\nfinancial liability. The financial liability is variable because the functional currency of Hive Digital\nTechnologies Ltd. is Canadian dollars and the Convertible Loan is denominated in US dollars, therefore the\nnumber of common shares to be issued depends on the foreign exchange rate at the date of settlement.\nConsequently, the conversion feature is classified as a derivative liability.\nThe Company allocated the proceeds of $15 million first to the derivative component for $8.6 million, with\nthe residual value to the liability component for $6.4 million. The derivative component was valued on initial\nrecognition using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: a risk-free interest\nrate of 0.69%; an expected volatility of 105%; an expected weighted average life of 2.71 years; a forfeiture\nrate of zero; and an expected dividend of zero.\nPage 12\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n10. Convertible Loan (continued…)\nLiability Component\nDerivative Component\nThe derivative component is remeasured each reporting period. As at September 30, 2024, the derivative\ncomponent was revalued at $0.03 million (March 31, 2024 - $0.1 million) using the Black-Scholes option\npricing model with the following assumptions: share price of C$4.32 (March 31, 2024 – C$4.56) an expected\nweighted average risk-free interest rate of 3.46% (March 31, 2024 – 4.5%); an expected weighted average\nvolatility of 72% (March 31, 2024 – 79%); and an expected weighted average life of 0.84 years (March 31,\n2024 - 1.1 years).\nFor the three and six months period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain in the\nchange in the fair value of the derivative liability of $0.02 million and $0.09 million, respectively (September\n30, 2023 - $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively).\n11. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities\nThe components of accounts payable and accrued liabilities are as follows:\nIncluded in accounts payable is $10.1 million for equipment received during the period ended September\n30, 2024, with Net30 terms, that was paid by the Company after the current period ended.\nPage 13\nAAHOT c c oc\nc ro\nldth\neo\nt a\nu nu\neb\nar\npl\nts pd\nliac\nk pa\ny a\nabab\nB a la n c e , M a r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 3P\nr in c ip a l p a y m e n tIn\nte r e s t p a y m e n tA\nc c r e tio n a n d in te r e s tB\na la n c e , M a r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 4P\nr in c ip a l p a y m e n tIn\nte r e s t p a y m e n tA\nc c r e tio n a n d in te r e s tB\na la n c e , S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4L\ne s s : C u r r e n t p o r tio n\nN o n - c u r r e n t p o r t io n\nB a la n c e , M a r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 3C\nh a n g e in fa ir v a lu e o f lia b ilityB\na la n c e , M a r c h 3 1 , 2 0 2 4C\nh a n g e in fa ir v a lu e o f lia b ilityB\na la n c e , S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4\ny a b leilitie\nsy\na b le ( N o te 4 )le\nS e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2$\n1 6 ,6\n1 ,7\n5\n8$\n1 9 ,8\n075070 272032 4\n$ 4 ,7 2 9\n( 3 ,0 0 0 )\n( 5 8 7 )\n2 ,4 1 2\n3 ,5 5 4\n( 1 ,5 0 0 )\n( 2 0 3 )\n9 4 2\n2 ,7 9 3\n( 2 ,0 5 2 )\n$ 7 4 1\n$ 4 8 2\n( 3 6 2 )\n1 2 0\n( 8 8 )$\n3 2\nM a r c h 3 1 , 2$\n7 ,4\n1 ,8\n5\n7$\n1 0 ,6\n067060 268004 4\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n12.

The purchase commitments reported at the current period end include\ncommitments of $37.1 million (March 31, 2024 - $nil) related to the development of the 100 MW facility\nin Paraguay.\nContingencies\n(a) Contingent VAT Liability to the Swedish Tax Authority (“STA”)\nThe Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries located in Sweden (Bikupa Datacenter AB (“Bikupa”) and\nBikupa Datacenter 2 AB (“Bikupa 2”)) received decision notice of assessments (“the decision(s)”), on\nDecember 28, 2022, December 21, 2023, and December 22, 2023 for Bikupa and February 14, 2023,\nand December 21, 2023 for Bikupa 2 respectively, from the STA in connection with the application of\nVAT and its ability to recover input VAT against certain equipment and other charges in a total amount\nof SEK 411.9 million or approximately $40.9 million. The assessments cover the period December\n2020 to December 2022 for Bikupa, and the period April 2021 to December 2022 for Bikupa 2,\nexpressing the intent to reject the recovery of all the VAT for the periods under assessment and\nrepayment of amounts previously received plus applicable interest.\nThe Company filed a formal appeal in connection with the December 28, 2022 Bikupa decision on\nFebruary 9, 2023; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will achieve a favourable\noutcome in its appeal. A formal appeal for Bikupa 2 in relation to the February 14, 2023 decision was\nfiled on March 10, 2023 by the Company. The Company engaged an independent legal firm and\nindependent audit firm in Sweden with expertise in these matters to assist in the appeal process. The\nCompany does not believe that the decision has merit because in management’s opinion and those of\nthe Company’s independent advisors, the decision is not compatible with the current applicable law\nand therefore the amount claimed to be owed by the Company is not probable. According to general\nprinciples regarding the placement of the burden of proof, it is up to the STA to provide sufficient\nevidence in support of its decision. It is the Company’s opinion, the STA has not substantiated their\nclaim. We are not aware of any precedent cases, authoritative literature, or other statement that\nsupports the STA's position. The cases are currently in the County Administrative Court.\nIt is not yet known when this dispute will be resolved; the due process following appeals and the court\nruling could extend beyond a year. Furthermore, given that the industry is rapidly developing, there\ncan be no guarantee that changes to the laws or policies of Sweden will not have a negative impact\non the Company’s tax position with respect to the eligibility of the claimed VAT.

Commitments and Contingencies (continued…)\n(a) Contingent VAT Liability to the Swedish Tax Authority (“STA”) (continued…)\nIf the Company is unsuccessful in its appeal, the full amount could be payable including other items\nsuch as penalties and interest that may accrue to the Company. The Company will continue to assess\nthese matters. At the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company has not recorded any amounts\npayable to the STA in connection with the decisions. The Company continues to monitor the activities\nof the claim with the STA. As at September 30, 2024, the Company has not received any additional\ncommunication from the STA.\n(b) Litigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in routine litigation incidental to the Company’s business.\nManagement believes that adequate provisions have been made where required and the ultimate\nresolution with respect to any claim will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or\nresults of the operations of the Company.\n16.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management\nThe fair values of investments were measured using the cost, market or income approaches. The\ninvestments measured at fair value are classified into one of the three levels in the fair value hierarchy\naccording to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values, with the designation based\nupon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair\nvalue hierarchy are:\nLevel 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity\ncan access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical\nor similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted\nprices.\nLevel 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (Unobservable inputs reflect management’s\nassumptions on how market participants would price the asset or liability based on the information\navailable).\nValuation of Assets that use Level 2 Inputs (“Level 2 Assets”). The fair value of Level 2 Assets would use\nthe quoted price from the exchanges which the Company most frequently uses, with no adjustment.\nThe Company is exposed, in varying degrees, to a variety of financial related risks. The fair value of the\nCompany’s financial instruments, including cash, amounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates\ntheir carrying value due to their short-term nature. The type of risk exposure and the way in which such\nexposure is managed is provided as follows:\nAt the period end the Company classified its financial assets into the following levels:\nPage 24\nA s s e tsC\na s h\nD ig ita l c u rre n c ieIn\nv e s tm e n ts\nL ia b ilitie sC\no n v e rtib le lo a nc\no m p o n e n t\ns\n-d e riv a tiv e\nA s a t S\nL e v e l 1\n$ -\n-\n2 2 ,8 5 8$\n2 2 ,8 5 8\n$ -$\n-\ne p te m b e r 3\nL e v e l 2$\n7 ,2 4 1\n1 6 5 ,1 7 7\n-$\n1 7 2 ,4 1 8\n$ -$\n-\n0 , 2 0 2 4\nL e v e l 3\n$ -\n-\n1 ,5 8 8$\n1 ,5 8 8\n$ 3 2$\n3 2\nA s\nL e v e l 1\n$ -\n-\n5 ,3 5 6$\n5 ,3 5 6\n$ -$\n-\na t M a rc h 3 1 , 2 0\nL e v e l 2$\n9 ,6 7 8\n1 6 1 ,6 4 5\n-$\n1 7 1 ,3 2 3\n$ -$\n-\n2 4\nL e v e l 3\n$ -\n-\n1 ,6 1 8$\n1 ,6 1 8\n$ 1 2 0$\n1 2 0\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n22.

Consists of the\nCompany’s digital currencies, where quoted prices in active markets are available. The fair value is\ndetermined by the volume-weighted average of prices across principal exchanges as of 12:00 AM UTC,\nper coinbase.com.\nValuation of Assets / Liabilities that use Level 3 Inputs (“Level 3 Assets / Liabilities”). Consists of the\nCompany’s investments in preferred stock, convertible notes and common stock. For the Company’s\ncommon stock investments:\n• Various Black Scholes models were utilized; and\n• A prior transaction approach was used for others; some adjusted.\nA verified prior transaction is initially given 100% weighting in a fair value conclusion (if completed at arm’s\nlength), but subsequently such weighting is adjusted based on the merits of newly observed data. As a\nresult, in the absence of disconfirming data, an unadjusted prior transaction price may not be considered\n“stale” for months or, in some cases, years.\nLevel 3 Continuity\nThe following is a reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities:\nThe carrying values of the Company’s cash, amounts receivable, accounts payable, term loan and loans\npayable approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying value of the Company’s lease\nliability is measured as the present value of the discounted future cash flows.\nThe carrying value of long-term receivable and loans payable (long term portion) are measured at amortized\ncosts which is similar to the fair value.\nPage 25\nL e v e l 3 C o n tin u ityA\ns s e ts\nIn v e s tm e n ts\nL ia b ilitie sC\no n v e rtib le lo a n -d\ne riv a tiv e c o m p o n e n t\nF a ir v a lu e a tM\na rc h 3 1 , 2 0 2 4\n$ 1 ,6 1 8$\n1 ,6 1 8\n$ 1 2 0$\n1 2 0\n$$\n$$\nA d d itio n s\n-\n-\n-\n-\n$$\n$$\nD is p o s a ls\n-\n-\n-\n-\n$$\n$$\nC h a n g e\nin fa ir v a lu e\n(3\n(3\n(8\n(8\n00\n88\n))\n))\nS\n$$\n$$\nF a ir V a lu e a t,\ne p te m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4\n1 ,5 8 8\n1 ,5 8 8\n3 2\n3 2\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n22. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued…)\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause\nthe other party to incur a financial loss. The Company’s primary exposure to credit risk is on its cash held\nin bank accounts as at September 30, 2024. The majority of cash is deposited in bank accounts held\nprimarily with one major bank in Canada so there is a concentration of credit risk. This risk is managed by\nusing a major bank that is a high credit quality financial institution as determined by rating agencies.\nFor the security of its digital currencies, the Company uses the services of two institutions through custodial\nagreements, one located in Liechtenstein and another in the United States.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk related to amounts receivable from the Swedish government related\nto VAT filings and from the Canadian and Quebec governments related to the sales tax filings. Refer to\nNote 6 for the at risk balances.\nThe amounts receivable for VAT filings are currently being withheld by the STA as a result of the decision\nnotice of assessments received for both Bikupa and Bikupa 2 (Note 15). The uncertainty surrounding the\nresolution of the dispute gives rise to potential credit risk, as there is the possibility that the Company may\nnot be able to fully collect the outstanding amounts from the Swedish government.\nThe amounts receivable for sales tax filings are currently being withheld by the Canadian and Quebec\ngovernments as a result of legislative changes to the Excise Tax Act surrounding mining activities in respect\nof crypto assets. The uncertainty surrounding the legislative changes gives rise to potential credit risk, as\nthere is the possibility that the Company may not be able to fully collect the outstanding amounts from the\nrespective Canadian and Quebec governments as applicable.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\nThe Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining cash balances to ensure that it is able to meet its short\nterm and long-term obligations as and when they fall due. The Company manages company-wide cash\nprojections centrally and regularly updates projections for changes in business and fluctuations caused by\ndigital currency prices and exchange rates.\nHIVE is primarily engaged in the cryptocurrency mining industry, a highly volatile market with significant\ninherent risk. Declines in the market prices of cryptocurrencies, an increase in the difficulty of\ncryptocurrency mining, delays in the delivery of mining equipment, changes in the regulatory environment\nand other adverse changes in the industry can significantly and negatively impact the Company’s\noperations and cash flows and its ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations.\nAdverse changes to the factors mentioned above have impacted the recoverability of the Company’s digital\nassets and property, and equipment, resulting in impairment losses being recorded.\nThe Company currently settles its financial obligations out of cash and digital assets. The Company has a\nplanning and budgeting process to help determine the funds required to support the Company’s normal\nspending requirements on an ongoing basis and its expansionary plans. At current BTC prices, the\nCompany’s existing cash resources and the proceeds from any sale of its treasury and mined BTC will be\nsufficient to fund its capital investments and support its growth objectives. If the BTC price declines\nsignificantly, the Company would be required to raise additional funds from external sources to meet these\nrequirements. Refer to details in Note 17 for the Company’s ATM Equity Programs.\nPage 26\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n22. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued…)\nAs at September 30, 2024, the contractual maturities of financial and other liabilities, including estimated\ninterest payments, are as follows:\nForeign currency risk\nCurrency risk relates to the risk that the fair values or future cash flows of the Company’s financial\ninstruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Exchange rate fluctuations affect\nthe costs that the Company incurs in its operations as well as the currency in which the Company has\nhistorically raised capital.\nThe Company’s presentation currency is the US dollar, major purchases are transacted in US dollars, while\nfinancing to date has been completed in Canadian and US dollars. As the Company operates in an\ninternational environment, some of the Company’s financial instruments and transactions are denominated\nin currencies other than an entity’s functional currency. A portion of the Company’s general and\nadministrative costs are incurred mainly in currencies separate from each entity’s functional currency, such\nas Swiss Francs, the Euro, the Swedish Krona, and Icelandic Krona. The fluctuation of these currencies in\nrelation to the US dollar will consequently impact the profitability of the Company and may also affect the\nvalue of the Company’s assets and liabilities and the amount of shareholders’ equity.\nThe Company’s net monetary position in the significant foreign currencies as of September 30, 2024 is\nsummarized below with the effect on earnings before tax of a 10% fluctuation of each currency relative to\nthe functional currency of the entity holding it to the US dollar:\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate\nbecause of changes in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited and\nonly relates to its ability to earn interest income on cash balances at variable rates. Changes in short term\ninterest rates will not have a significant effect on the fair value of the Company’s cash account. The interest\nrate on the Company’s loans is fixed in nature and have limited exposure to changes in interest rates.\nPage 27\nATCLLT c c o u n ts p a y a b lee\nrm lo a no\nn v e rtib le lo a ne\na s e c o m m itm e n tso\na n s p a y a b le a n d ino\nta l\nte re s t\nC a n a dES\nwS\nw eIc\ne la\nC o n tra c tu a l\nc a s h flo w s w ith in 1 y e a r\n$ 1 7 ,5 5 0 $ 1 7 ,5 5 0\n4 ,6 3 1 4 ,6 3 1\n4 ,0 6 3 3 ,2 1 6\n8 ,3 9 8 3 ,2 4 4\n1 4 ,5 7 8 1 ,4 2 7$\n4 9 ,2 2 0 $ 3 0 ,0 6 8\nN e t M o n e ta r y P o s itioS\ne p te m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2(\nU S D $ e q u iv a le n t) ( $U\nS D o lla r s ( 3 ,6 5 1ia\nn D o lla r s 2 1 4u\nr o D o lla r s 3 8is\ns F r a n c s 7 8d\nis h K r o n a ( 4 9 3n\nd ic K r o n a 8 2 7\n1 to 3 y e a rs 3 to 5 y e a rs\n$ - $ -\n- -\n8 4 7 -\n4 ,3 7 5 7 7 9\n4 ,0 1 5 2 ,4 9 9$\n9 ,2 3 7 $ 3 ,2 7 8\nn Im p a c t o f 1 0 % v a r ia n c e4\nin fo r e ig n e x c h a n g e r a te)\n( in fo r e ig n c u r r e n c y ) ( $ ))\n3 3 2\n1 4\n4\n8)\n4\n1\n5 + y e a rs\n$ -\n-\n-\n-\n6 ,6 3$\n6 ,6 3\n77\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n22. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued…)\nPrice risk\nPrice risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to\nchanges in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign currency risk. The\nCompany is not exposed to any significant price risks with respect to its financial instruments.\nLoss of access risk\nThe loss of access to the private keys associated with the Company’s digital currency holdings may be\nirreversible and could adversely affect an investment. Digital currencies are controllable only by an\nindividual that possesses both the unique public key and private key or keys relating to the \"digital wallet\"\nin which the digital currency is held. To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised\nand no backup is accessible the Company may be unable to access the digital currencies.\nIrrevocability of transactions\nDigital currency transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred digital currencies may be\nirretrievable. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain,\nan incorrect transfer or theft generally will not be reversible, and the Company may not be capable of\nseeking compensation.\nRegulatory oversight risk\nRegulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of digital currencies or the operation of digital currency\nnetworks or exchanges in a manner that adversely affects investments held by the Company.\nDigital asset risk\nDigital currencies are measured at fair value less cost to sell. Digital currency prices are affected by various\nforces including global supply and demand, interest rates, exchanges rates, inflation or deflation and the\npolitical and economic conditions. Further, digital currencies have no underlying backing or contracts to\nenforce recovery of invested amounts. The profitability of the Company is related to the current and future\nmarket price of digital currencies; in addition, the Company may not be able to liquidate its holdings of\ndigital currencies at its desired price if necessary. Investing in digital currencies is speculative, prices are\nvolatile and market movements are difficult to predict. Supply and demand for such currencies change\nrapidly and are affected by a variety of factors, including regulation and general economic trends. Digital\ncurrencies have a limited history, their fair values have historically been volatile, and the value of digital\ncurrencies held by the Company could decline rapidly. A decline in the market prices of digital currencies\ncould negatively impact the Company's future operations. Historical performance of digital currencies is\nnot indicative of their future performance.\nMany digital currency networks are online end-user-to-end-user networks that host a public transaction\nledger (blockchain) and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptographic and algorithmic\nprotocols governing such networks. In many digital currency transactions, the recipient or the buyer must\nprovide its public key, which serves as an address for a digital wallet, to the seller. In the data packets\ndistributed from digital currency software programs to confirm transaction activity, each party to the\ntransaction must sign transactions with a data code derived from entering the private key into a hashing\nalgorithm, which signature serves as validation that the transaction has been authorized by the owner of\nthe digital currency. This process is vulnerable to hacking and malware and could lead to theft of the\nCompany’s digital wallets and the loss of the Company’s digital currency.\nPage 28\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n22. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued…)\nWhile the Company does not store cryptocurrency on an exchange, the public failure of cryptocurrency\nexchanges appears to affect the value of cryptocurrencies and the cryptocurrency and crypto mining\nindustries as a whole. As noted above, digital currency transactions are irrevocable. There are no\ngovernmental bodies that backstop the security of cryptocurrencies against theft or loss. A general loss of\nconfidence in the technology that underlies the cryptocurrency industry, or a loss of confidence in the\nindustry, itself, could substantially devalue our Bitcoin holdings and threaten the viability of our\ncryptocurrency mining business.\nDigital currencies are loosely regulated and there is no central marketplace for exchange. Supply is\ndetermined by a computer code, not a central bank. Additionally, exchanges may suffer from operational\nissues, such as delayed execution, that could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nAdditionally, to the extent that the digital asset exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume\nin digital asset trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such\ndigital asset exchanges' failures may result in loss or less favorable prices of digital currencies, or may\nadversely affect the Company, its operations and its investments.\nSafeguarding of digital assets\nThe Company utilizes the Fireblocks platform which provides the Company a secure medium to access its\ndigital wallets and transact with reputable exchanges on sales of its digital assets. At the period end the\nCompany utilised the Fireblocks platform for 98% of its digital currencies associated with its operations.\nFireblocks, with locations in New York and Tel Aviv, utilizes a secure hot vault and secure transfer\nenvironment to help establish connections between the Company’s wallets and exchanges. Fireblocks\nutilizes multi-party computation (“MPC”) protection layers to distribute private key secrets across multiple\nlocations to ensure there is no single point of failure associated with the private keys. The use of MPC\nensures private key shards are never concentrated to a single device at any point in time. The Company\nutilizes the Fireblocks Policy Engine to designate transaction approval policies for digital assets held within\nthe Fireblocks portal. As such, administrators configure automated rules to ensure all transactions are\ndisbursed based on the asset sent, total value of the transaction, source and destination of funds and signor\nrequirements. All transactions initiated from Fireblocks that fail to meet the Company’s predefined criteria\nper the engine policy are automatically rejected. All internal wallets owned by the Company and external\nwallets for addresses of the Company’s counterparties require multiple approvals in accordance with our\nwhitelisting policy. As such, the Company settles with counterparties or entities without the risk of losing\nfunds due to deposit address attacks or errors. Fireblocks is SOC 2 Type II certified for the defined period\nand undergoes a SOC 2 review on an annual basis. The Company reviews the Fireblocks SOC 2 report\nto ensure they maintain a secure technology infrastructure and that their systems are designed and\noperating effectively. Additionally, the Company reviews its own complementary user entity controls in\nconjunction with the Fireblocks controls to ensure that applicable trust services criteria can be met.\nFireblocks maintains an insurance policy which has coverage for technology, cyber, and professional\nliability and is rated “A” by A.M. Best based on the strength of the policy and has had no known security\nbreaches or incidents reported to date.\nPage 29\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n22. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued…)\nDigital asset mining risk\nThe digital asset mining industry has seen rapid growth and innovation. In this environment of rapid change,\nthere is no assurance that the Company will be able to compete effectively. The Company’s expenses may\nbe greater than we anticipate, and our investments to make the Company more efficient or to gain digital\nasset mining market share may not outpace our competitors. Moreover, the cost of gaining efficiency and\nmaintaining or enhancing profit margins may be more than the Company can support given its overall\nstrategy of holding Bitcoin, the currency in which our operating profits are generated. Among the factors\nthat affect our position are the following.\nASIC and GPU miners and other necessary hardware for mining are subject to malfunction, technological\nobsolescence, shortages in the global supply chain and difficulty and cost in obtaining new hardware. In\nthis context, we note that much has been said in the media about the widespread availability of GPU based\nmining machines as former Ethereum miners shut down their operations. The machines that HIVE requires\nare ASIC mining machines that are designed and built for Bitcoin mining, which is our main focus. As a\nresult, any major malfunction out of the typical range of downtime for normal maintenance and repair of our\nBitcoin mining systems could cause a significant disruption in our ability to continue mining, which could\nresult in lower yields and harm our digital asset mining market share. New ASIC miners can be costly and\nmay be in short supply.\nThere can be no assurances that the most efficient ASIC mining hardware will be readily available when\nwe identify the need for it. We face competition in acquiring mining machines from major manufacturers\nand, at a given time, mining machines may only be available for pre-order months in advance. As a result\nof competition for the latest generation ASIC mining machines, or if we unexpectedly need to replace our\nmining machines due to a faulty shipment or other failure, we may not be able to secure replacement\nmachines at reasonable costs on a timely basis.\nProof-of-work mining operations (such as the mining operations required to mine Bitcoin) consume\nsignificant amounts of electricity, and recently, there has been increased focus on, and public debate\nsurrounding, the negative environmental, social and governance considerations associated with such\noperations. Regulatory changes or actions in foreign jurisdictions may affect the Company’s business or\nrestrict the use of one or more digital assets, mining activity or the operation of their networks or the digital\nasset exchange market in a manner that adversely affects the Company’s business. If regulators or public\nutilities take actions that restrict or otherwise impact mining activities, there may be a significant decline in\nsuch activities, which could adversely affect digital asset networks, the Company’s business and the market\nprice of the Company’s common shares. Because Bitcoin is a leading crypto currency, all of the foregoing\nrisk factors may apply especially to Bitcoin, which is central to our business.\nPage 30\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n22. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued…)\nThe Company’s business strategy currently focuses on mining Bitcoin and our hardware is limited to mining\nusing current proof-of-work protocols. There could be developments in proof of work protocols, or other\ncompeting validation methods or processes that render such business strategy obsolete or out of favor\ngenerally. Proof-of-stake is an alternative method of validating digital asset transactions. Proof-of-stake\nmethodology does not rely on resource intensive calculations to validate transactions and create new blocks\nin a blockchain. Instead, the validator of the next block on a blockchain is determined, sometimes randomly,\nbased on a methodology in the blockchain software. Rewards, and sometimes penalties, are issued based\non the amount of digital assets a user has “staked” in order to become a validator. As a result of the Merge,\non September 15, 2022, Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake validation method, and the Company stopped\nmining Ethereum. Should Bitcoin also shift from a proof-of-work validation method to a proof-of-stake or\nother method, the transaction verification process (i.e., “mining” or “validating”) may render our mining\nbusiness less competitive or less profitable. While we are not aware of how the Bitcoin blockchain could\nbe so fundamentally modified, we have seen applications that offer sidechain alternatives to mining Bitcoin\ndirectly on the Bitcoin blockchain but that are integrated with the Bitcoin blockchain. To date, such efforts\nthat we are aware of have been directed at increasing the volume and speed of Bitcoin transaction\nprocessing.\nThe aggregate computing power of the global Bitcoin network has generally grown over time, and we expect\nit to continue to grow in the future. The barriers to entry for new Bitcoin miners are relatively low, which\ncan give rise to additional capacity from competing miners. As the hash rate in the Bitcoin network\nincreases, the amount of Bitcoin earned per unit of hash rate decreases. The Bitcoin protocol responds to\nincreasing total hash rate by increasing the “difficulty” of Bitcoin mining. If this “difficulty” increases at a\nsignificantly higher rate, we would need to increase our hash rate at the same rate in order to maintain\nmarket share and generate equivalent block rewards. Therefore, in order to maintain or increase our market\nshare, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures.\nAny decrease in the Company’s effective market share would result in a reduction in our share of block\nrewards and transaction fees, which could adversely affect our financial performance and financial position.\nThere is also a risk that the Company could be negative affected by a Bitcoin halving event. Halving is a\nprocess designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in Bitcoin. At a predetermined\nblock, the mining reward is cut in half. The Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024 and the next Bitcoin\nhalving is expected to occur April 2028. While Bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around\nBitcoin halvings, there is no guarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the\nreduction in mining reward. If Bitcoin price and difficulty do not maintain or continue their trend of adjusting\nto pre-Bitcoin halving profitability levels over time, or the period of market normalization after the Bitcoin\nhalving to pre-Bitcoin halving profitability levels is too long, there is a risk that the Bitcoin halving will render\nthe Company unprofitable for a sustained time period. In addition, a sustained reduction in Bitcoin price\ncould affect the value of our ASIC mining fleet which is engineered for Bitcoin mining with the result that\nsubstantial write downs are required for this equipment. These events could result in the Company being\nunable to continue as a going concern.\nHigh performance computing risk\nThe Company faces risks related to technological obsolescence and revenue dependence. Rapid\nadvancements in high-performance computing hardware could quickly render the Company's equipment\nobsolete, necessitating costly upgrades to maintain competitiveness. Additionally, reliance on a\nmarketplace platform exposes the Company to fluctuations in demand, changes in marketplace rules, or\nchanges in revenue sharing structures. If the marketplace modifies its terms, increases fees, or reduces\nthe visibility of certain vendors, it could significantly impact the Company's financial performance under this\nsegment.\nPage 31\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n22. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued…)\nUncertain tax positions\nVarious foreign jurisdictions have, and may continue to adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect a\ndigital asset network, the digital asset markets, and their users, particularly digital asset exchanges and\nservice providers that fall within such jurisdictions’ regulatory scope. For example, if China or other foreign\njurisdictions were to ban or continue to otherwise restrict mining activity, including by regulating or limiting\nmanufacturers’ ability to produce or sell semiconductors or hard drives in connection with mining, it would\nhave a material adverse effect on digital asset networks, the digital asset market, and as a result, impact\nour business.\nA number of foreign jurisdictions have recently taken regulatory action aimed at digital asset activities.\nChina has made transacting in digital currencies illegal for Chinese citizens in mainland China, and\nadditional restrictions may follow. As recently as September 2021, China’s central bank has further\nrestricted digital asset-related activities, stating that activity by overseas digital asset exchanges, and\nservices offering trading, order matching, and token issuance and derivatives, constitute illegal activity.\nBoth China and South Korea have banned initial coin offerings entirely and regulators in other jurisdictions,\nincluding Canada, Singapore, and Hong Kong, have opined that initial coin offerings may constitute\nsecurities offerings subject to local securities regulations. In September 2021, the Chinese government\nannounced issued a complete ban that restricts digital currencies trading and mining activities, citing\nconcerns about high energy consumption and its desire to promote financial stability. Regulators in the\nInner Mongolia and other regions of China have proposed regulations that would create penalties for\ncompanies engaged in digital currency mining activities and introduce heightened energy saving\nrequirements on industrial parks, data centers and power plants providing electricity to digital currency\nminers. The effect of the China ban was a movement of those miners and their hashrates out of China and\ninto other countries. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority published final rules in October\n2020 banning the sale of derivatives and exchange traded notes that reference certain types of digital\ncurrencies, contending that they are “ill-suited” to retail investors citing extreme volatility, valuation\nchallenges and association with financial crime.\nForeign laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the jurisdiction we operate in and may\nnegatively impact the acceptance of one or more digital assets by users, merchants and service providers\nand may therefore impede the growth or sustainability of the digital asset economy in the European Union,\nChina, Japan, Russia and the United States and globally, or otherwise negatively affect the value of digital\nassets that we invest in. The effect of any future regulatory change on our business or the digital assets\nthat we invest in is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to our\ninvestment and trading strategies, the value of our assets and our investment value.\nPage 32\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n23. Digital Currency and Risk Management\nDigital currencies are measured using Level 2 inputs (Note 22).\nDigital currency prices are affected by various forces including global supply and demand, interest rates,\nexchange rates, inflation or deflation and the global political and economic conditions. The profitability of\nthe Company is directly related to the current and future market price of coins; in addition, the Company\nmay not be able liquidate its inventory of digital currency at its desired price if required. A decline in the\nmarket prices for coins could negatively impact the Company’s future operations. The Company has not\nhedged the conversion of any of its coin sales or future mining of digital currencies.\nDigital currencies have a limited history and the fair value historically has been very volatile. Historical\nperformance of digital currencies is not indicative of their future price performance. The Company’s digital\ncurrencies currently mainly consist of Bitcoin. The table below shows the impact for every 5% variance in\nthe price of Bitcoin on the Company’s earnings before tax, based on the closing price at September 30,\n2024.\n24. Capital Management\nThe Company manages its capital to maintain its ability to continue as a going concern and to provide\nreturns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders. The capital structure of the Company consists\nof equity comprised of issued share capital and reserves.\nThe Company manages its capital structure and adjusts it in light of economic conditions. The Company,\nupon approval from its Board of Directors, will balance its overall capital structure through new share issues,\ncommencement of ATM Equity Programs, the sale of digital currencies or by undertaking other activities as\ndeemed appropriate under the specific circumstances.\nThe Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements due to its term loan (Note 13). The\nCompany’s overall strategy with respect to capital risk management remains unchanged from the prior\nyear.\nPage 33\nB itc o in $\nIm p a c t o f 5 % v a r ia n\n8\ncp\n,2\ne inr\nic e\n4 3\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\nNotes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars unless otherwise indicated)\n(Unaudited)\n25. Segmented Information\nThe Company operates in one segment, with two revenue streams being the mining of digital currencies\nand high performance computing hosting. External revenues are attributed by geographical location, based\non the country from which services are provided.\nThe Company’s plant and equipment are located in the following jurisdictions:\n26.

Subsequent Events\nSubsequent to the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 3,600 common shares under\nthe RSU plan upon the exercise of restricted share units.\nOn October 3, 2024, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement (“October 2024 Equity\nDistribution Agreement”).

If you have questions or require\nassistance with voting your shares, you may contact the Corporation’s proxy solicitation agent:\nLaurel Hill Advisory Group\nNorth America Toll-Free: 1-877-452-7184\nOutside North America: 1-416-304-0211\nEmail: assistance@laurelhill.com\nYOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. PLEASE VOTE YOUR SHARES TODAY.\nDated October 23, 2024\nFRANK HOLMES\nEXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN\nHIVE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES LTD.\nDear Shareholders,\nAs Executive Chairman, I am honored to share with you the remarkable strides Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. (“HIVE” or the\n“Corporation”) has made over the past year. Our relentless focus on innovation, efficiency, and sustainability continues to propel\nus forward as a leader in both the digital asset and high-performance computing sectors. I am proud to report several key\naccomplishments that have positioned us for long-term growth and shareholder value creation.\n1. Expansion of Green Energy:\nWe are excited about our 100-megawatt expansion in Paraguay, which we announced in July. This move furthers our\ncommitment to harnessing renewable green energy, primarily hydro. It aligns with our broader strategy of powering our\noperations sustainably, contributing to a greener future while continuing to enhance our efficiency.\n2. Increased Presence in the Global Bitcoin Mining Network:\nOver the past year, HIVE has been responsible for approximately 1% of the global Bitcoin mining network. With our\nexpansion plans in Paraguay, we aim to double our presence, targeting 2% of the global network by next year. This\ngrowth will solidify our leadership and reinforce our position in the industry.\n3. Strategic Bitcoin HODLing:\nWe have HODL’d over 2,600 Bitcoin on our balance sheet from our operations, marking a 50% increase from the\nprevious year. This strategic move reflects our confidence in the long-term value of Bitcoin and our commitment to\nmaximizing shareholder value. At US$70,000 per Bitcoin, owning over 2,600 Bitcoin equates to US$189 million or\nUS$1.57 per share, based on 120 million shares outstanding.\n4. Operational Efficiency and Global Reach:\nHIVE continues to be recognized as the most efficient Bitcoin miner, a distinction we are proud of. Our operations span\nnine time zones and function in four different languages, with plans to add a fifth language as we expand into Paraguay.\nThis global footprint allows us to operate efficiently and effectively around the clock, further enhancing our competitive\nedge.\n5. Minimizing Shareholder Dilution and Navigating the Halving:\nThroughout our growth, we have maintained a disciplined approach to capital management, ensuring minimal shareholder\ndilution and the lowest G&A cost to mine a Bitcoin in the sector. Additionally, as we did four years ago, we have\nsuccessfully managed the halving, positioning ourselves for continued growth in the post-halving market environment.\n6. AI and GPU Revenue Growth:\nOur initial suite of NVIDIA chips has generated approximately US$10 million in cash flow, and we are well on our way\nto scaling this business by 10x. As a Preferred Status client of NVIDIA, we are leveraging their latest technology,\nincluding the powerful H100 chips, to expand our capabilities and grow our high-performance computing (HPC)\nbusiness, which complements our core Bitcoin mining operations.\nThese achievements reflect our unwavering commitment to driving innovation and operational excellence across nine time zones\nand soon to be five languages. The future is bright for HIVE, and I want to thank each of our shareholders for your continued trust\nand support as we execute our growth strategy. We are confident that the progress we have made will lead to even greater success\nin the coming years. We encourage you to follow our updates on social media channels and review our latest corporate presentation\nat hivedigitaltechnologies.com/investors/presentation/ .\nWe trust this recap will encourage your confidence in our management team’s performance and our board of directors by supporting\nour proxy.\nSincerely,\n“Frank Holmes”\nFrank Holmes\nExecutive Chairman, Hive Digital Technologies Ltd.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT:\nThis letter contains forward looking information and HIVE cautions readers that forward looking information is based on certain\nassumptions and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of HIVE.

In order to be valid and acted upon at the Meeting, the form of\nproxy must be received no later than 11:00 a.m. (Pacific time) on December 9, 2024 or be deposited with the Secretary of\nthe Corporation before the commencement of the Meeting or any adjournment thereof. The deadline for the deposit of\nproxies may be waived or extended by the Chair of the Meeting at his discretion, without notice.\nIf you are a non-registered holder of Common Shares and have received these materials through your broker, custodian,\nnominee or other intermediary, please complete and return the form of proxy or voting instruction form provided to you\nby your broker, custodian, nominee or other intermediary in accordance with the instructions provided therein.\n- 4 -\nThe document appointing a proxy must be in writing and executed by the Shareholder or his attorney authorized in writing\nor, if the Shareholder is a corporation, under its corporate seal or by an officer or attorney thereof duly authorized.\nA Shareholder submitting a form of proxy has the right to appoint a person (who need not be a Shareholder) to\nrepresent him or her at the Meeting other than the persons designated in the form of proxy furnished by the\nCorporation. To exercise that right, the name of the Shareholder’s appointee should be legibly printed in the blank\nspace provided. In addition, the Shareholder should notify the appointee of the appointment, obtain his or her\nconsent to act as appointee and instruct the appointee on how the Shareholder’s Common Shares are to be voted.\nShareholders who are not registered shareholders of the Corporation should refer to “Notice to Beneficial Holders of\nCommon Shares” below.\nRevocation of Proxy\nA Shareholder who has submitted a form of proxy as directed hereunder may revoke it at any time prior to the exercise\nthereof. If a person who has given a proxy personally attends the Meeting at which that proxy is to be voted, that person\nmay revoke the proxy and vote in person. In addition to the revocation in any other manner permitted by law, a proxy may\nbe revoked by instrument in writing executed by the Shareholder or his attorney or authorized agent and deposited with\nComputershare Investor Services Inc. at any time up to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on December 9, 2024: (i) by mail delivery\nto 100 University Avenue, 9th Floor, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2Y1; or (ii) by toll-free facsimile at 1-866-732-VOTE (8683)\n(toll free within North America) or 1-312-588-4290 (outside North America), or deposited with the Secretary of the\nCorporation before the commencement of the Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, and upon either of those deposits, the\nproxy will be revoked.\nNotice to Beneficial Holders of Common Shares\nOnly registered Shareholders or proxyholders duly appointed by registered Shareholders are permitted to vote at\nthe Meeting. Most Shareholders of the Corporation are “non-registered” shareholders because the Common\nShares they own are not registered in their names but are instead registered in the name of a brokerage firm, bank\nor other intermediary or in the name of a clearing agency. Shareholders who do not hold their Common Shares in\ntheir own name (referred to herein as “Beneficial Shareholders”) should note that only registered Shareholders are\nentitled to vote at the Meeting. If Common Shares are listed in an account statement provided to a Shareholder by a\nbroker, then in almost all cases those Common Shares will not be registered in such Shareholder’s name on the records of\nthe Corporation. Such Common Shares will more likely be registered under the name of the Shareholder’s broker or an\nagent of that broker. In Canada, the vast majority of such Common Shares are registered under the name of CDS & Co.\n(the registration name for CDS Clearing and Depositary Services Inc., which company acts as nominee for many Canadian\nbrokerage firms). Common Shares held by brokers (or their agents or nominees) on behalf of a broker’s client can only be\nvoted (for or against resolutions) at the direction of the Beneficial Shareholder. Without specific instructions, brokers and\ntheir agents and nominees are prohibited from voting Common Shares for the brokers’ clients. Therefore, each Beneficial\nShareholder should ensure that voting instructions are communicated to the appropriate person well in advance of the\nMeeting.\nRegulatory policy requires brokers and other intermediaries to seek voting instructions from Beneficial Shareholders in\nadvance of Shareholders’ meetings. The various brokers and other intermediaries have their own mailing procedures and\nprovide their own return instructions to clients, which should be carefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to\nensure that their Common Shares are voted at the Meeting. Often the form of proxy supplied to a Beneficial Shareholder\nby its broker is identical to the form of proxy provided by the Corporation to the registered Shareholders. However, its\npurpose is limited to instructing the registered Shareholder (i.e. the broker or agent of the broker) how to vote on behalf of\nthe Beneficial Shareholder. The majority of brokers now delegate the responsibility for obtaining instructions from clients\nto Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (“Broadridge”). Broadridge typically prepares a machine-readable voting\ninstruction form, mails those forms to the Beneficial Shareholders and asks Beneficial Shareholders to return the forms to\nBroadridge, or otherwise communicate voting instructions to Broadridge (by way of the internet or telephone, for example).\nBroadridge then tabulates the results of all instructions received and provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting\nof Common Shares to be represented at the Meeting. A Beneficial Shareholder who receives a Broadridge voting\ninstruction form cannot use that form to vote Common Shares directly at the Meeting. The voting instruction form\nmust be returned to Broadridge (or instructions respecting the voting of Common Shares must be communicated\nto Broadridge well in advance of the Meeting) in order to have the Common Shares voted.\n- 5 -\nThe Corporation may use Broadridge’s QuickVote™ service to assist eligible Beneficial Shareholders that are “non-\nobjecting beneficial owners” with voting their Shares over the telephone. Certain Non-Registered Shareholders who\nare non-objecting beneficial owners may be contacted by Laurel Hill, which is soliciting proxies on behalf of the\nmanagement of the Corporation, to conveniently obtain voting instructions directly over the telephone.\nProxy-related materials are being sent both to registered Shareholders and indirectly to Beneficial Shareholders. Beneficial\nShareholders fall into two categories – those who object to their identity being known to the issuers of securities which\nthey own (“Objecting Beneficial Owners”, or “OBOs”) and those who do not object to their identity being made known\nto the issuers of the securities they own (“Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners”, or “NOBOs”). Pursuant to NI 54-101, the\nCorporation is sending the proxy-related materials indirectly through onward intermediaries for onward distribution to\nNOBOs and OBOs. Management of the Corporation intends to pay for intermediaries to forward the proxy-related\nmaterials to OBOs.\nAlthough Beneficial Shareholders may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes of voting Common\nShares registered in the name of their broker, a Beneficial Shareholder may attend the Meeting as proxyholder for the\nregistered Shareholder and vote the Common Shares in that capacity. Beneficial Shareholders who wish to attend the\nMeeting and indirectly vote their Common Shares as proxyholder for the registered Shareholder should enter their\nown names in the blank space on the proxy or voting instruction card provided to them and return the same to\ntheir broker (or the broker’s agent) in accordance with the instructions provided by such broker.\nAll references to Shareholders in this Circular, instrument of proxy and Notice of Meeting are to registered shareholders\nof the Corporation unless specifically stated otherwise.\nVoting\nCommon Shares represented by any properly executed proxy in the accompanying form will be voted for or against, or\nwithheld from voting, as the case may be, on any ballot that may be called for in accordance with the instructions given by\nthe Shareholder. In the absence of such direction, such Common Shares will be voted in favour of the matters set\nout herein.\nThe accompanying form of proxy confers discretionary authority on the persons named in it with respect to amendments\nor variations to matters identified in the Notice of Meeting or other matters that may properly come before the Meeting.\nAs of the date hereof, management of the Corporation is not aware of any such amendments, variations or other matters\nwhich may come before the Meeting. In the event that other matters come before the Meeting, then the management\ndesignees intend to vote in accordance with the judgment of management of the Corporation.\nINTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON\nNo person who has been a director or an executive officer of the Corporation at any time since the beginning of its last\ncompleted financial year, no proposed nominee for election as a director of the Corporation nor any associate of any such\ndirector, director nominee or officer has any material interest, direct or indirect, by way of beneficial ownership of securities\nor otherwise, in any matter to be acted upon at the Meeting, except as disclosed in this Circular.\nVOTING SHARES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF\nThe authorized share capital of the Corporation consists of an unlimited number of Common Shares without par value\nand an unlimited number of Preferred Shares without par value. The Corporation’s Common Shares are listed on the\nTSX-V under the symbol “HIVE” and on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “HIVE”.\nAs at October 23, 2024, there are 121,582,810 Common Shares issued and outstanding and nil Preferred Shares\noutstanding. Each Common Share entitles the holder thereof to one vote on all matters to be acted upon at the Meeting.\nThe Corporation has fixed the close of business on October 23, 2024 (the “Record Date”) as the record date. Shareholders\nwhose names have been entered in the register of Shareholders at the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled\nto receive notice of, and to vote, at the Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Persons registered on the\nbooks of the Corporation at the close of business on the Record Date and persons who are transferees of any Common\nShares acquired after such Record Date and who have produced properly endorsed certificates evidencing such Common\n- 6 -\nShares or who otherwise establish ownership thereof and demand, not later than ten (10) days before the Meeting, that\ntheir names be included in the list of Shareholders, are entitled to vote at the Meeting.\nTo the knowledge of the directors and officers of the Corporation, as at the date of this Circular, no person or\ncorporation beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or exercises control or direction over, 10% or more of the\nCommon Shares.\nPARTICULARS OF MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON\nTo the knowledge of the board of directors of the Corporation (the “Board”), the only matters to be brought before the\nMeeting are those matters set forth in the accompanying Notice of Meeting.\n1. Receipt of Financial Statements\nThe financial statements of the Corporation for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 and the report\nof the auditors thereon, will be submitted to the Meeting. Receipt at the Meeting of the auditor’s report and the\nCorporation’s audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 will not constitute\napproval or disapproval of any matters referred to therein.\n2. Election of Directors\nThe Board currently consists of four (4) directors. At the Meeting, Shareholders will be asked to consider, and, if thought\nfit, approve with or without variation a resolution electing the four (4) persons named below.

However, if any other matter properly comes\nbefore the Meeting, valid forms of proxy will be voted on such matter in accordance with the best judgment of the persons\nvoting the proxy.\nSTATEMENT OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nNamed Executive Officers\nFor the purposes of this Information Circular, a Named Executive Officer (“NEO”) of the Corporation means each of\nthe following individuals:\n(a) a chief executive officer (“CEO”) of the Corporation;\n(b) a chief financial officer (“CFO”) of the Corporation;\n(c) in respect of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, the three most highly compensated executive officers\nother than the individuals identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) at the end of the most recently completed\nfinancial year whose total compensation was more than $150,000; and\n(d) each individual who would be an NEO under paragraph (c) above but for the fact that the individual was\nneither an executive officer of the Corporation, nor acting in a similar capacity, at the end of that financial\nyear.\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nCompensation provided to the Corporation’s NEOs is determined and reviewed by the Corporation’s Compensation\nCommittee. In establishing executive compensation policies, the Compensation Committee takes into consideration\nthe recommendations of management and, following discussion and review, reports them to the Corporation’s full\nBoard of Directors for final approval. The members of the Compensation Committee are Dave Perrill, Susan B. McGee\nand Marcus New.\nCompensation plays a key role in achieving the Corporation’s business objectives and in thereby creating and\nperpetuating value for its shareholders over the long term. The Compensation Committee and the Corporation at large\nbelieve that executive compensation must serve three functions if it is to fulfill its role optimally. First, it must offer\ncompetitive pay in terms of both value and structure to attract outside executives of the highest calibre. Second, it\nmust appropriately reward the exceptional contributions of its current executives to retain their talents for the future\nbenefit of the Corporation. Third, it must align the personal interests of the Corporation’s executives with those of its\nshareholders, such that all levels of its organization are incentivized to maximize long-term shareholder value.\nTo put this philosophy into practice, the Corporation’s compensation of NEOs has come to consist of the following:\n(a) Base Salary;\n(b) Eligibility to Receive Bonuses in the Form of Cash Payments;\n(c) Option Based Awards; and\n(d) Awards under the Corporation’s Restricted Share Unit Plan.\n- 15 -\nAll these tools have distinct roles to play in realizing the Corporation’s executive compensation philosophy and the\nBoard of Directors used each of them in shaping the specific amounts and forms of compensation to be paid to the\nCorporation’s executives during the year ended March 31, 2024. Grounded in the above philosophy, the Board of\nDirectors considered a number of factors to tailor each NEO’s compensation package to their unique circumstances,\nincluding their performance during the fiscal year, their roles and responsibilities, their historical compensation and\nhistorical performance and the relationship therebetween, the compensation of comparable roles at comparable\ncorporations, and any contractual commitments the Corporation has made to its executives regarding compensation.\nThe Board of Directors has not conducted a formal evaluation of the implications of the risks associated with the\nCorporation’s compensation policies. Risk management is a consideration of the Board of Directors when\nimplementing its compensation policies and the Board of Directors do not believe that the Corporation’s compensation\npolicies result in unnecessary or inappropriate risk-taking including risks that are likely to have a material adverse\neffect on the Corporation.\nCompensation Governance\nDetermination of the Amount of Each Element of Executive Compensation, Compensation Risk and\nCompensation Governance\nCompensation of the NEOs of the Corporation is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee, which makes\nits recommendations to the Board. The Corporation evaluates its direct compensation levels (base salary plus short-\nterm incentive and long-term incentives) and performs high-level analyses of the short and long-term design practices\nrelative to the competitive market. In the 2023 financial year, the Company identified the peer group companies (the\n“Peer Group”), whose compensation practices are reviewed annually to generally ensure that the practices of the\nCorporation remain aligned with the current size and scope of the Corporation’s operations:\nPeer Group\nBitfarms Ltd. CleanSpark, Inc. Hut 8 Mining Corp.\nMarathon Digital Holdings, Inc. Riot Platforms, Inc.\nFor example: in the March 31, 2023 financial year, following a review of the compensation practices of the above\nPeer Group, it was determined to make an RSU award to Mr. Holmes in remuneration for prior years of service, during\nwhich he took on executive duties and navigated the Corporation through a bear market, completed acquisitions of\ndata centres in New Brunswick (Atlantic Datacentre) and Quebec (Lachute Datacentre), built competitive revenues\nand cash flows relative to the Peer Group, but did not receive compensation for his role as Chief Executive Officer.\nIn particular, under the leadership of Mr. Holmes, the Compensation Committee noted that in comparison to the Peer\nGroup, the Corporation established high levels of Bitcoin mined per Exahash, low levels of general and administrative\nexpenses per Bitcoin mined and minimal levels or share dilution. See note (8) to the Summary Compensation Table\nbelow for a description regarding the fair value calculation for these RSUs, which the Board believes is commensurate\nwith compensation awarded by industry peers. The Company has not made changes to the composition of the Peer\nGroup nor has it made significant changes to its compensation practices in the 2024 financial year.\nThe Board reviews from time to time and at least once annually, the risks, if any, associated with the Corporation’s\ncompensation policies and practices at such time. Implicit in the Board’s mandate is that the Corporation’s policies\nand practices respecting compensation, including those applicable to the Corporation’s executives, be designed in a\nmanner which is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders and risk implications is one of many\nconsiderations which are taken into account in such design.\nCompensation by the granting of options and RSUs is both “long term” and “at risk” and, accordingly, is directly\nlinked to the achievement of long-term value creation. As the benefits of such compensation, if any, are not realized\nby the executive until a significant period of time has passed, the ability of executives to take inappropriate or excessive\nrisks that are beneficial to them from the standpoint of their compensation at the expense of the Corporation and its\nshareholders is limited.\n- 16 -\nThe Board closely monitors and considers any risks which may be associated with the Corporation’s compensation\npolicies and practices. Risks, if any, may be identified and mitigated through regular Board meetings during which,\nfinancial and other information of the Corporation are reviewed, and which includes executive compensation.\nCompensation of the NEOs of the Corporation is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee, which approves\nthe compensation of the NEOs.\nBase Salary\nThe Corporation believes that a competitive base salary is a necessary element of any compensation program that is\ndesigned to attract and retain talented and experienced executives. The Corporation also believes that base salaries\noffer a security and independence that variable compensation alone could not, and that attractive salaries can motivate\nand reward executives for their overall performance.\nTo the extent that the Corporation has entered into employment agreements with its executives, the base salaries of\nsuch individuals reflect the base salaries that the Corporation negotiated with them. The base salaries that the\nCorporation negotiated with its executives were based on the individual experience and skills of, and expected\ncontribution from, each executive, the roles and responsibilities of the executive, the base salaries of the Corporation’s\nexisting executives and other factors.\nEligibility to Receive Bonuses in the Form of Cash Payments\nThe Compensation Committee, together with recommendations from management, awards bonuses based on both\nindividual performance and corporate success at various times throughout the year. Such bonuses incentivize\nexceptional performance and appropriately reward the individual contributions of executives from year to year. At\nthis time, the Corporation does not have any specific milestone criteria for issuing bonuses.\nOption Based Awards\nThe Corporation has in effect the Option Plan. Grants of stock options and restricted share units, as equity-based\ncompensation, are unique in furthering all three functions of an effective compensation regime. They are used to\nappropriately compensate directors, officers, senior management personnel and consultants of the Corporation for\ntheir individual contributions in a given year, to enable the Corporation to attract and retain experienced and qualified\nindividuals in those positions by rewarding sustained performance with increasing stakes in the long-term success of\nthe Corporation, and to align executives’ personal incentives with those of the Shareholders by permitting such\nindividuals to directly participate in any increase in per share value created by their efforts.\nIn determining option grants to the NEO’s, the Compensation Committee together with management takes into\nconsideration factors that include the amount and exercise price of previous option grants, other forms and amounts\nof compensation in the current and previous fiscal years, the NEOs experience, level of expertise and responsibilities,\ntheir historical compensation and performance, and the particular contributions of each NEO towards the completion\nof corporate transactions during the fiscal year.\nSee “PARTICULARS OF MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON — 4. Re-approval of Rolling Stock Option Plan” above\nfor significant terms of the Option Plan and Schedule “C” for the full text of the Option Plan, which qualifies the listed\nsignificant terms in their entirety.\nAwards under the Corporation’s Restricted Share Unit Plan\nThe Corporation also has a RSU Plan in effect. Grants of restricted share units and stock options, as equity-based\ncompensation, are unique in furthering all three functions of an effective compensation regime. They are used to\nappropriately compensate directors, officers, senior management personnel and consultants of the Corporation for\ntheir individual contributions in a given year, to enable the Corporation to attract and retain experienced and qualified\nindividuals in those positions by rewarding sustained performance with increasing stakes in the long-term success of\nthe Corporation, and to align executives’ personal incentives with those of the Shareholders by permitting such\nindividuals to directly participate in any increase in per share value created by their efforts.\n- 17 -\nIn determining RSU grants to the Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee together with management\ntakes into consideration factors that include the amount of previous RSU grants, other forms and amounts of\ncompensation in the current and previous fiscal years, the NEOs experience, level of expertise and responsibilities,\ntheir historical compensation and performance, and the particular contributions of each NEO towards the completion\nof corporate transactions during the fiscal year.\nSee “PARTICULARS OF MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON — 5.\nRe-approval of Restricted Share Unit Plan” above for significant terms of the RSU Plan and Schedule “D” for the full\ntext of the RSU Plan, which qualifies the listed significant terms in their entirety.\nPension Plan Benefits\nNo pension, retirement or deferred compensation plans, including defined contribution plans, have been instituted by\nthe Corporation and none are proposed at this time.\nUse of Financial Instruments\nThe Corporation does not have a policy that would prohibit a Named Executive Officer or director from purchasing\nfinancial instruments, including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars or units of exchange funds,\nthat are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted as compensation or held,\ndirectly or indirectly, by the Named Executive Officer or director. However, management is not aware of any Named\nExecutive or director purchasing such an instrument.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following performance graph shows the cumulative return for Common Shares on the TSX-V and the Nasdaq\ncompared to the S&P/TSX Composite Index from March 31, 2019 to March 31, 2024.\nMarch 31, 2019 March 31, 2024\nHIVE (TSX-V) $100.00 $168.89\nHIVE (Nasdaq) $100.00 $167.66\nS&P/TSX Composite $100.00 $137.67\n- 18 -\nAs of March 31, 2024, the value of $100 invested in the Common Shares on March 31, 2019 had increased by\napproximately 68.9% on the TSX-V compared to increases of 37.7% for a similar investment in the S&P/TSX\nComposite Index.\nThere is no direct correlation between the performance of the Common Shares and executive compensation. The\nCommon Share price may be affected by a number of factors beyond the control of directors and management,\nincluding general and industry-specific economic and market conditions. The Compensation Committee evaluates\nperformance by reference to the overall direction and success of the Corporation rather than by any short-term\nfluctuations in the trading price of the Common Shares.\nManagement believes the Corporation’s compensation is reasonable given a number of factors. The Corporation does\nnot use benchmarks or comparable companies in determining its executive compensation, however, the Corporation\ncontinues to maintain among the lowest general and administrative expenses (including Management compensation)\nin the cryptocurrency mining sector.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nIn accordance with applicable legislation, the Corporation had Named Executive Officers during the financial year\nended March 31, 2024, namely Frank Holmes, Darcy Daubaras, Aydin Kilic, Gabriel Ibghy, Johanna Thörnblad and\nWilliam Gray.\nThe following table sets forth particulars of all compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers during the years\nended March 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, expressed in Canadian dollars.\nNon-equity incentive plan\ncompensation ($)\nLong-\nFinancial\nAnnual term Pension Total\nName and Year Option- All other\nPrincipal ended Salary Share-based based incentive incentive value compensation compensation\nPosition March 31 ($) awards ($) awards ($) plans plans ($) ($) ($)\nFrank 2024 Nil Nil 119,453(10) Nil Nil Nil 217,000(1)(20) 336,453\nHolmes(1)\nExecutive 2023 Nil 6,876,000(7)(9) Nil Nil Nil Nil 225,921(1)(20) 7,101,921(7)\nChairman\nFormer\n2022 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil 105,430(1)(20) 105,430\nCEO\n2024 312,000 Nil 447,950(10) 183,600 Nil Nil 101,256(20) 1,044,806\nDarcy\nDaubaras(2) 2023 311,000 594,000(9) Nil 76,600 Nil Nil 99,374(20) 1,080,974\nCFO\n2022 263,750 Nil Nil 112,500 Nil Nil 23,437(20) 399,687\n2024 Nil 859,564(11)(12) 447,950(10) 162,400 Nil Nil 312,000(21) 1,781,914\nAydin\nKilic(3),\n2023 Nil 452,160(8) 353,529(13) 126,600 Nil Nil 312,000(21) 1,244,289\nPresident\nand CEO\n2022 Nil 148,000(14) 3,033,361(15) 61,500 Nil Nil 232,258(21) 3,181,361\n2024 257,692 83,732(11) 298,634(10) 62,500 Nil Nil Nil 702,558\nGabriel\nIbghy(4),\n2023 229,705 316,412(8) 247,471(13) 32,500 Nil Nil Nil 826,088\nGeneral\nCounsel\n2022 153,846 Nil 335,205(16) 44,167 Nil Nil Nil 533,218\n2024 211,102 121,417(11) 298,634(10) 41,921 Nil Nil 100,413(20) 773,487\n2023 183,229 316,412(8) 247,471(13) 30,857 Nil Nil 99,798(20) 877,767\n- 19 -\nNon-equity incentive plan\ncompensation ($)\nLong-\nFinancial\nAnnual term Pension Total\nName and Year Option- All other\nPrincipal ended Salary Share-based based incentive incentive value compensation compensation\nPosition March 31 ($) awards ($) awards ($) plans plans ($) ($) ($)\nJohanna\nThörnblad(5\n),\n2022 157,522 Nil 650,449(18)(19) 43,082 Nil Nil 28,285(20) 721,816\nCountry\nPresident,\nSweden\n2024 231,923 165,865(11) 298,634(10) 56,250 Nil Nil Nil 752,672\nWilliam\nGray(6), 2023 203,231 316,412(8) 247,471(13) 39,750 Nil Nil Nil 806,864\nCTO\n2022 145,193 Nil 791,428(16)(17) 42,500 Nil Nil Nil 979,121\nNotes:\n(1) Mr. Holmes has served as Executive Chairman since March 25, 2022.

The\nBlack-Scholes assumptions used by the Corporation were: i) annualized volatility: 105%; ii) expected life: 10.00 years; iii) risk-free interest\nrate: 1.84%; and iv) dividend yield: 0%; this is consistent with the accounting values used in the Corporation’s financial statements.\n(20) Mr. Holmes, Mr. Daubaras and Ms. Thornblad each earn director fees of US $75,000 per year commencing on January 1, 2022, for serving\non a number of the Corporation’s subsidiary company boards.\n(21) The Corporation paid $26,000 per month since April 1, 2022, and prior to that paid $25,000 per month since August 17, 2021, and paid\n$10,000 per month since January 1, 2021, to Unimage, a company controlled by Mr. Kilic.\nOutstanding Share-Based Awards and Option-Based Awards\nThe following table sets forth particulars of all outstanding share-based and option-based awards granted to the NEOs\nand which were outstanding at March 31, 2024, expressed in Canadian dollars:\n- 21 -\nOption-based Awards Share-based Awards(3)\nMarket or\npayout\nvalue of\nNumber Market or vested\nof shares payout share-\nNumber of or units value of based\nsecurities Value of of shares share-based awards\nunderlying Option Option unexercised in- that have awards that not paid\nunexercised exercise expiration the-money not vested have not out or\nName options (#) price ($) date options ($)(1) (#) vested ($)(2) distributed\n500,000 1.50 Sept 14, 2027 1,530,000\nFrank\n100,000 1.45 Feb 10, 2030 311,000 208,333 950,000 2,470,000\nHolmes\n20,000 6.86 Jul 6, 2028 Nil\n100,000 1.35 Dec 21, 2028 321,000\nDarcy\n100,000 1.45 Feb 10, 2030 311,000 Nil Nil 684,000\nDaubaras\n75,000 6.86 Jul 6, 2028 Nil\n2,000(4) 15.70 Feb 11, 2031 Nil\n180,000(5) 18.50 Oct 7, 2031 Nil\nAydin\n165,352 754,005 54,720\nKilic 72,000(5) 5.66 Aug 26, 2027 Nil\n75,000(5) 6.86 Jul 6, 2028 Nil\n20,000 18.35 Apr 29, 2031 Nil\nGabriel\n50,400 5.66 Aug 26, 2027 Nil 25,062 114,283 181,944\nIbghy\n50,000 6.86 Jul 6, 2028 Nil\n20,000 25.15 Apr 6, 2031 Nil\n10,000 21.00 Dec 8, 2031 Nil\nJohanna\n31,616 144,169 9,576\nThörnblad\n50,400 5.66 Aug 26, 2027 Nil\n50,000 6.86 Jul 6, 2028 Nil\n20,000 18.35 Apr 29, 2031 Nil\n20,000 25.35 Nov 10, 2031 Nil\nWilliam\n39,346 179,418 57,456\nGray\n50,400 5.66 Aug 26, 2027 Nil\n50,000 6.86 Jul 6, 2028 Nil\nNotes:\n(1) The value of unexercised in-the-money Options is calculated by multiplying the difference between the closing price of the Corporation’s\ncommon shares on the TSX Venture Exchange on March 31, 2024, which was $4.56, and the Option exercise price, by the number of\noutstanding options (both vested and unvested).\n(2) Market value of the RSUs was calculated by multiplying the number of unvested RSUs, respectively, by the market value of the underlying\nshares on March 31, 2024, which was $4.56.\n(3) This table sets forth all RSUs that have been granted to each NEO and are outstanding as at March 31, 2023.\n(4) Issued to Unimage, a company controlled by Mr. Kilic.\n(5) Issued to Akilic, a company controlled by Mr. Kilic.\nIncentive Plan Awards – Value Vested or Earned During the Year\n320,000 stock options were granted to Named Executive Officers during the year ended March 31, 2024, of which\n320,000 vested during the year ended March 31, 2024. 193,850 stock options that were previously granted to Named\nExecutive Officers vested during the year ended March 31, 2024.\n214,876 restricted share units were granted to Named Executive Officers during the year ended March 31, 2024, of\nwhich Nil vested during the year ended March 31, 2024. 919,600 restricted share units that were previously granted\nto Named Executive Officers vested during the year ended March 31, 2024.

The Compensation Committee noted that in the most recent\ncompleted financial year, following a review of the compensation practices of the above Peer Group, it was determined\nto make an RSU award to Mr. Holmes in remuneration for prior years of service, during which he took on executive\nduties and navigated the company through a bear market, completed acquisitions of data centres in New Brunswick\n(Atlantic Datacentre) and Quebec (Lachute Datacentre), built competitive revenues and cash flows relative to the Peer\nGroup, but did not receive compensation for his role as Chief Executive Officer. In particular, under the leadership of\nMr. Holmes, the Compensation Committee noted that in comparison to the Peer Group, the Corporation established\nhigh levels of Bitcoin mined per Exahash, low levels of general and administrative expenses per Bitcoin mined and\nminimal levels or share dilution. See note (8) to the Summary Compensation Table above for a description regarding\nthe fair value calculation for these RSUs, which the Board believes is commensurate with compensation awarded by\nindustry peers.\nThe following table summarizes, for the Named Executive Officers of the Corporation, the value of incentive plan\nawards vested or earned during the year ended March 31, 2024, expressed in Canadian dollars:\nOption-based awards – Share-based awards – Non-equity incentive\nValue vested during the Value vested during the compensation – value\nNEO Name year ($) year ($) earned during the year ($)\nFrank Holmes Nil 3,236,083 Nil\nDarcy Daubaras Nil 440,500 183,600\nAydin Kilic 10,080 198,470 162,600\nGabriel Ibghy 7,056 125,349 62,500\nJohanna Thornblad 7,056 125,349 41,921\nWilliam Gray 7,056 125,349 56,250\nNAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYMENT, CONSULTING AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS\nThe Corporation has entered into written agreements with certain of its NEOs, namely Darcy Daubaras, Aydin Kilic,\nGabriel Ibghy, and William Gray which contain terms relating to duties, salaries, compensation, benefits, termination,\nchange of control and severance.

(the “Corporation”) is required to and hereby discloses its corporate governance practices\nas follows.\nBoard of Directors\nThe Board of Directors (“the Board”) and senior management consider good corporate governance to be central to the\neffective and efficient operation of the Corporation. The Board is committed to a high standard of corporate\ngovernance practices. The Board believes that this commitment is not only in the best interest of the Shareholders, but\nthat it also promotes effective decision making at the Board level.\nNI 58-101 defines an “independent director” as a director who has no direct or indirect “material relationship” with\nthe issuer. A “material relationship” is as a relationship which could, in the view of the Board, be reasonably expected\nto interfere with the exercise of a member’s independent judgment. The Board maintains the exercise of independent\nsupervision over management by ensuring that the majority of its directors are independent.\nThe Board is currently comprised of four (4) directors, being Frank Holmes (Executive Chairman), Susan B. McGee,\nMarcus New, and Dave Perrill. All of these directors are standing for re-election at the Meeting.\nMarcus New, Susan B. McGee and David Perrill are independent within the meaning of NI 58-101. Frank Holmes is\nnot independent as he is an employee of the Corporation in his position as Executive Chairman and thereby has a\n“material relationship” with the Corporation.\nThe Board believes that it functions independently of management and reviews its procedures on an ongoing basis to\nensure that it is functioning independently of management. When conflicts arise, interested parties are precluded from\nvoting on matters in which they may have an interest. The Board does not hold regularly scheduled meetings at which\nnon-independent directors and members of management are not in attendance. However, in light of the suggestions\ncontained in National Policy 58-201 – Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board convenes occasional meetings,\nas deemed necessary, of the independent directors, at which non-independent directors and members of management\nare not in attendance. See “PARTICULARS OF MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON—2. Election of Directors—Meeting\nAttendance” above for details of meeting attendance by director.\nThe Executive Chairman of the Board is Frank Holmes, who is not an independent director. A majority of the\nCorporation’s directors are independent, namely Marcus New, Susan B. McGee, and David Perrill. The Board\nprovides leadership to its independent directors by encouraging them to bring forth agenda items, by assuring they\nhave direct access to members of management and to information regarding the Corporation’s activities, and by\n- 26 -\nretaining outside advisors when necessary. The Corporation’s independent directors also possess a depth and breadth\nof personal experience that provides them with leaderships qualities, and they are each in leadership roles over the\nCorporation’s committees, such as the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance\nCommittee. Finally, in the event any conflict arises, the independent directors may convene an in camera meeting of\nthe independent directors on an ad hoc basis.\nBoard Mandate\nThe Board maintains a written mandate, which is attached in full as Appendix “B” to this Circular.\nBoard Diversity and Term Limits\nThe Corporation’s senior management and Board have varying backgrounds and expertise and were selected on the\nbelief that the Corporation and its stakeholders would benefit from a broad range of talent and cumulative experience.\nThe Board considers merit as the essential requirement for board and executive appointments, and as such, it has not\nadopted a diversity policy or any specific target number or percentage, or a range of target numbers or percentages,\nrespecting the representation of women, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, or members of visible\nminorities (collectively, “members of designated groups”) on the Board or in senior management roles.\nAlthough the level of representation of members of designated groups is one of the many factors taken into\nconsideration in making Board and executive officer appointments, emphasis is placed on hiring or advancing the\nmost qualified individuals. The Corporation has not adopted term limits or other mechanisms of Board renewal as it\ntakes the view that they may result in directors who have accumulated valuable industry experience being forced to\nleave their position arbitrarily. The Corporation believes that directors should be assessed based on their ability to\ncontinue to make a meaningful contribution to the Corporation.\nAs of the date of this disclosure, the members of designated groups currently holding positions on the Board or in\nsenior management are as follows:\nAs of the date of disclosure, the board of directors of the Corporation consists of:\n➢ A total of 4 directors\n➢ 1 is female (25%)\n➢ 0 are persons with disabilities (0%)\n➢ 0 are Indigenous persons (0%)\n➢ 0 are members of visible minorities (0%)\nAs of the date of disclosure, the senior management team of the Corporation consists of:\n➢ A total of 5 members\n➢ 1 is female (20%)\n➢ 0 are persons with disabilities (0%)\n➢ 0 are Indigenous persons (0%)\n➢ 0 are members of visible minorities (0%)\n➢ Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(F) and 5606, the Corporation is required to provide\nshareholders with a Board diversity matrix, which is attached to this Circular as Schedule “E”.\nOther Public Company Directorships\nThe directors of the Corporation are directors of the following other reporting issuers:\nName Name of Reporting Issuer\nFrank Holmes Goldspot Discoveries Inc.\nMarcus New Mapath Capital Inc.\nDave Perrill None\nGoldman Sachs BDC, Inc.\nSusan B. McGee\nGoldman Sachs Private Credit LLC\n- 27 -\nName Name of Reporting Issuer\nGoldman Sachs Private Credit II LLC\nGoldman Sachs Private Credit Corp\nGS Phillip Street Middle Market Lending LLC\nOrientation and Continuing Education of Board Members\nWhile the Corporation currently has no formal orientation and education program for new Board members, it is\nexpected that sufficient information (such as recent financial statements, technical reports and various other operating,\nproperty and budget reports) will be provided to all new Board members to ensure that new directors are familiarized\nwith the Corporation’s business and the procedures of the Board. In addition, new directors will be encouraged to visit\nand meet with management on a regular basis. The Corporation also encourages continuing education of its directors\nand officers where appropriate in order to ensure that they have the necessary skills and knowledge to meet their\nrespective obligations to the Corporation. For instance, the Corporation, among other things, pays for Board members\nto attend conferences and webinars in the space of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining in order to stay\nup to date with the industry’s leaders and best practices. The Board’s continuing education consists of correspondence\nwith the Corporation’s legal counsel to remain up to date with developments in relevant corporate and securities law\nmatters.\nEthical Business Conduct\nThe Board has adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics (the “Ethics Code”), and may be accessed at the\nCorporation’s website at https://hivedigitaltechnologies.com/corporate/governance or requested in physical form free\nof charge upon request to the Corporation’s Chief Financial Officer at info@hivedigitaltech.com. Persons to whom\nthe Ethics Code applies are expected and instructed to notify their supervisor, the CEO, the CFO, or any other senior\noffice of the Corporation who may be designated from time to time, of any violations of the Ethics Code. The Board\nperiodically reviews the Ethics Code to ensure that it is following industry best practices and standards.\nIn addition, Board members are subject to the fiduciary duties placed on individual directors by the Corporation’s\ngoverning corporate legislation and the common law; the Corporation has found that the restrictions placed by\napplicable corporate legislation on an individual director’s participation in decisions of the Board in which the director\nhas an interest have been sufficient to ensure that the Board operates independently of management and in the best\ninterests of the Corporation.\nUnder the corporate legislation, a director is required to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests\nof the Corporation and exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in\ncomparable circumstances. A director must also disclose to the Board the nature and extent of any interest of the\ndirector in any material contract or material transaction, whether made or proposed, if the director is a party to the\ncontract or transaction, is a director or officer (or an individual acting in a similar capacity) of a party to the contract\nor transaction or has a material interest in a party to the contract or transaction. The director must then abstain from\nvoting on the contract or transaction unless the contract or transaction (i) relates primarily to their remuneration as a\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or an affiliate of the Corporation, (ii) is for indemnity or\ninsurance for the benefit of the director in connection with the Corporation, or (iii) is with an affiliate of the\nCorporation.\nIf the director abstains from voting after disclosure of their interest, the disinterested directors approve the contract or\ntransaction, and the contract or transaction was reasonable and fair to the Corporation at the time it was entered into,\nthe contract or transaction is valid and the director is not accountable to the Corporation for any profit realized from\nthe contract or transaction. Otherwise, the director must have acted honestly and in good faith, the contract or\ntransaction must have been reasonable and fair to the Corporation and the contract or transaction must be approved\nby the shareholders by special resolution after receiving full disclosure of its terms in order if the director is to avoid\nsuch liability or the contract or transaction being invalid.\nBy following these procedures, the Board ensures that directors exercise sufficient independent judgment when\nconsidering transactions and agreements in respect of which a director or executive officer has a material interest.\nNomination of Directors\n- 28 -\nThe Board does not have a nominating committee. The Board, with the advice of its Corporate Governance\nCommittee, is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become new Board members and recommending to\nmanagement new director nominees for the next annual meeting of the shareholders.\nThe Board encourages an objective nomination progress by considering a broad spectrum of candidates for director\npositions, including any candidates recommended by shareholders. The Board considers many factors before\nrecommending an individual as director, including their background, employment and qualifications. New nominees\nmust have a track record in general business management, special expertise in an area of strategic interest to the\nCorporation, the ability to devote the time required, shown support for the Corporation’s mission and strategic\nobjectives, and a willingness to serve. By focusing on these factors, the Board encourages the selection of people who\nare objectively best suited to managing the Corporation.\nCompensation\nThe Corporation has a Compensation Committee which currently consists of the following members: Dave Perrill,\nMarcus New, and Susan B. McGee. In addition, Frank Holmes attends meetings of the Compensation Committee as\nExecutive Chairman. See “STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE—Board of Directors” above for the\nindependence of these members.\nThe primary function of the Compensation Committee is to monitor and make recommendations to the Board in\nrespect of the total compensation paid by the Corporation to its senior executives and significant consultants. The\nCompensation Committee has reviewed and approved the “STATEMENT OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION”\nsection above. Please see that section for the details of the Corporation’s compensation philosophy and process for\ndetermining composition of the compensation paid to senior executives and significant consultants.\nTo ensure an objective process for determining compensation, HIVE has included all independent Directors as\nmembers of the Compensation Committee.

If the Participant has an employment or consulting agreement with the Company, the term\n“cause” shall include any meaning given to that term in the employment or consulting agreement or, if\nsuch term is not defined in such agreement, shall mean any ground which would justify the services of the\nParticipant to be terminated without notice or payment in lieu and/or shall have the meaning given to such term\nunder any Applicable Law; and\n(b) upon the termination without cause, the Disability, or the death of a Participant, the Participant or the\nParticipant’s beneficiary, as the case may be, shall for each grant of RSUs, have a number of RSUs become vested\nequal to: (A x B/C) – D, where:\nA = the original number of RSUs granted;\nB = the number of completed months of employment since the Grant Date;\nC = the number of total months required to achieve the full vesting of such grant of RSUs;\nD = the number of RSUs that have become vested and were previously settled in accordance with the Plan.\nSuch vested RSUs shall be settled in accordance with Section 4.8.\n4.11 No Compensation for Cancelled RSUs Awards\n8\nA Participant ceases to be an Eligible Person on the Participant’s last day of actual and active employment with\nthe Company or a Subsidiary. For the purposes of the Plan, no period of notice of termination of employment that\nis or ought to have been given to a Participant after the date on which the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Person\nshall be included in determining the Participant’s entitlement under the Plan. Section 4.11 applies regardless of\nwhether the Participant received compensation in respect of dismissal or was entitled to a period of notice of\ntermination which would otherwise have permitted a greater portion of the RSUs to vest with the Participant. All\nRSUs will cease to vest as at the date upon which the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Person.

All determinations of the Board under this Section will be final, binding and\nconclusive for all purposes.\n6.3 Limitations\nThe grant of RSUs under the Plan will in no way affect the Company’s right to adjust, reclassify, reorganize\nor otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, amalgamate, reorganize, consolidate, dissolve,\nliquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets or engage in any like transaction.\n7.
