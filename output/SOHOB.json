Our refinancing of the mortgage at our Jacksonville Doubletree location was a major milestone and highlight for the Company in the quarter, given the current tough conditions in the mortgage and lending markets for commercial properties. The mortgage provides for nearly $9.5 million in available financing to fund life cycle capital improvements at this property, which will commence in early Q2 of 2025 and conclude at the end of 2026. Also in the quarter, Hurricane Helene impacted Florida. In our portfolio, only the Hotel Alba in Tampa was materially impacted by the storm, which was the most severe hurricane to hit Tampa in 100 years. The storm produced a record surge two feet greater than any previously measured. Our hotel experienced flooding on its ground floor that resulted in a material casualty to interior spaces and systems. The hotel remained open, and remediation and restoration commenced immediately. The hotel is fully insured, has remained open, and the Company expects to recover lost revenues through business interruption insurance. Our staff and partners did a superb job in handling this dangerous casualty.\"\n\n**Balance Sheet/Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $32.5 million of available cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $18.5 million was reserved for real estate taxes, insurance, capital improvements and certain other expenses or otherwise restricted. The Company had principal balances of approximately $321.3 million in outstanding debt, including mortgage and unsecured principal balances, at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.95%.\n\n**Other Events**\n\nOn July 8, 2024, affiliates of the Company entered into loan documents to secure a mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront hotel located in Jacksonville, FL with Fifth Third Bank, N.A. Pursuant to the loan documents, the mortgage loan: (i) has an initial principal balance of $26.25 million (the \"Initial Tranche\"), with an additional $9.49 million available to fund a product improvement plan at the hotel (the \"Renovation Tranche\"); (ii) has a 5-year term maturing on July 8, 2029; (iii) carries a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 3.00%; (iv) amortizes the Initial Tranche on a 25-year schedule at 7.0% interest rate and requires payments of interest only on the Renovation Tranche; (v) is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership, with the guarantee reducing to 25% upon achieving a 1.35x debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for two consecutive quarters following a renovation period; and (vi) contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default for a mortgage loan.\n\nOn August 14, 2024, affiliates of the Company entered into loan documents to secure a second mortgage loan on the DeSoto hotel located in Savannah, GA with MONY Life Insurance Company. Pursuant to the loan documents, the second mortgage: (i) has an initial principal balance of $5.0 million; (ii) has a maturity date of July 1, 2026; (iii) carries a fixed interest rate of 7.50%; (iv) amortizes on a 25-year schedule; (v) allows for prepayment with a premium due; and (vi) contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default for a mortgage loan.\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company is updating its previously issued guidance for 2024, accounting for current and expected performance within its portfolio, taking into account market conditions, the refinance of the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, the second mortgage on The DeSoto hotel in Savannah, Georgia and weather-related events including Hurricane Helene. The updated guidance is predicated on estimates of occupancy and ADR that are consistent with the most recent 2024 calendar year forecasts by Smith Travel Research for the market segments in which the Company operates. The table below reflects the Company’s projections, within a range, of various financial measures for 2024, in thousands of dollars, except per share and RevPAR data:\n\n**Previous 2024 Guidance**| **Revised 2024 Guidance**  \n---|---  \n**Low Range**| **High Range**| **Low Range**| **High Range**  \nTotal revenue| $| 178,952| $| 182,567| $| 177,795| $| 180,138  \nNet (loss) income| 1,598| 2,593| (497| )| 100  \nNet loss attributable to common stockholders and unitholders| (6,377| )| (5,382| )| (8,472| )| (7,875| )  \nEBITDA| 39,858| 40,853| 38,993| 39,590  \nHotel EBITDA| 46,103| 46,898| 44,974| 45,571  \nFFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders| 12,373| 13,368| 10,481| 11,078  \nAdjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders| 12,778| 13,773| 12,821| 13,418  \nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders| $| (0.32| )| $| (0.27| )| $| (0.43| )| $| (0.40| )  \nFFO per common share and unit| $| 0.62| $| 0.67| $| 0.53| $| 0.56  \nAdjusted FFO per common share and unit| $| 0.64| $| 0.69| $| 0.65| $| 0.68  \nRev PAR| $| 117.16| $| 119.52| $| 115.51| $| 117.03  \nHotel EBITDA margin| 25.8| %| 25.7| %| 25.3| %| 25.3| %  \n  \n**Earnings Call/Webcast**\n\nThe Company will conduct its third quarter 2024 conference call for investors and other interested parties at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, November 12, 2024.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our current strategies, expectations, and future plans are generally identified by our use of words, such as “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “potential,” “opportunity,” and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. We also sometimes refer to our booking pace. Booking pace is an industry term that we define as the estimated value of committed future bookings at a given point in time. Booking pace can be further separated into various segments, including group booking pace or business travel booking pace. All statements regarding our expected financial position, booking pace, business and financing plans are forward-looking statements.\n\nFactors which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future operations, results, performance and prospects, include, but are not limited to: national and local economic and business conditions that affect occupancy rates and revenues at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services; risks associated with the hotel industry, including competition and new supply of hotel rooms, increases in wages, energy costs and other operating costs; risks associated with the level of our indebtedness and our ability to meet covenants in our debt agreements, including loan modifications and, as necessary, to refinance or seek an extension of the maturity of such indebtedness or further modification of such debt agreements; risks associated with adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes; impacts on the travel industry from pandemic diseases, including COVID-19; the availability and terms of financing and capital and the general volatility of the securities markets; management and performance of our hotels; risks associated with maintaining our system of internal controls; risks associated with the conflicts of interest of the Company’s officers and directors; risks associated with redevelopment and repositioning projects, including delays and cost overruns; supply and demand for hotel rooms in our current and proposed market areas; risks associated with our ability to maintain our franchise agreements with our third party franchisors; our ability to acquire additional properties and the risk that potential acquisitions may not perform in accordance with expectations; our ability to successfully expand into new markets; legislative/regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing taxation of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”); the Company’s ability to maintain its qualification as a REIT; and our ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore there can be no assurance that such statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.\n\nAdditional factors that could cause actual results to vary from our forward-looking statements are set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, in this press release and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to and does not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although the Company believes its current expectations to be based upon reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained or that actual results will not differ materially.\n\nFinancial Tables Follow…\n\n**SOTHERLY HOTELS INC.****CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n(unaudited)  \n**ASSETS**  \nInvestment in hotel properties, net| $| 372,952,913| $| 354,919,106  \nCash and cash equivalents| 14,017,642| 17,101,993  \nRestricted cash| 18,488,112| 9,134,347  \nAccounts receivable, net| 3,185,999| 5,945,724  \nPrepaid expenses, inventory and other assets| 6,309,930| 6,342,310  \n**TOTAL ASSETS**| **$**| **414,954,596**| **$**| **393,443,480**  \n**LIABILITIES**  \nMortgage loans, net| $| 318,061,006| $| 315,989,194  \nUnsecured notes| 906,280| 1,536,809  \nFinance lease liabilities| 22,742,195| —  \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities| 23,713,552| 23,315,677  \nAdvance deposits| 2,879,011| 2,614,981  \nDividends and distributions payable| 2,088,160| 2,088,160  \n**TOTAL LIABILITIES**| **$**| **370,390,204**| **$**| **345,544,821**  \nCommitments and contingencies| —| —  \n**EQUITY**  \nSotherly Hotels Inc. stockholders’ equity  \nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value, 11,000,000 shares authorized:  \n8.0% Series B cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock, 1,464,100 and 1,464,100 shares issued and outstanding;

unitholders| $| 12,821| $| 13,418  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company considers the non-GAAP financial measures of FFO (including FFO per common share and unit), Adjusted FFO (including Adjusted FFO per common share and unit), EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA to be key supplemental measures of the Company’s performance and could be considered along with, not alternatives to, net income (loss) as a measure of the Company’s performance. These measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or amounts available for the Company’s discretionary use and should not be considered alternative measures of net income, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. \n\n**FFO**\n\nIndustry analysts and investors use FFO as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income or loss determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP, gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, gains or losses from involuntary conversions of assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization or impairment, and adjustment for any noncontrolling interest from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by itself.\n\nThe Company considers FFO to be a useful measure of adjusted net income (loss) for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because we believe FFO is most directly comparable to net income (loss), which remains the primary measure of performance, because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Although FFO is intended to be a REIT industry standard, other companies may not calculate FFO in the same manner as we do, and investors should not assume that FFO as reported by us is comparable to FFO as reported by other REITs.\n\n**Adjusted FFO**\n\nThe Company presents Adjusted FFO, including Adjusted FFO per share and unit, which adjusts for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT’s definition of FFO including changes in deferred income taxes, any unrealized gain (loss) on hedging instruments, losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains on extinguishment of preferred stock, aborted offering costs, loan modification fees, franchise termination costs, costs associated with the departure of executive officers, litigation settlement, management contract termination costs, operating asset depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on a change in control, ESOP and stock compensation expenses and negative lease amortization on our finance ground lease obligation. We exclude these items as we believe it allows for meaningful comparisons between periods and among other REITs and is more indicative than FFO of the on-going performance of our business and assets. Our calculation of Adjusted FFO may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs.\n\n**EBITDA**\n\nThe Company believes that excluding the effect of non-operating expenses and non-cash charges, and the portion of those items related to unconsolidated entities, all of which are also based on historical cost accounting and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance, can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods and between REITs, even though EBITDA also does not represent an amount that accrues directly to shareholders.\n\n**Hotel EBITDA**\n\nThe Company defines Hotel EBITDA as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) income tax provision or benefit, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) impairment of long-lived assets or investments, (6) gains and losses on disposal and/or sale of assets, (7) gains and losses on involuntary conversions of assets, (8) realized or unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments not included in other comprehensive income, (9) other income at the properties, (10) loss on early debt extinguishment, (11) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) debt forgiveness, (12) gain on exercise of development right, (13) corporate general and administrative expense, and (14) other income not related to our wholly-owned portfolio. We believe this provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our wholly-owned hotels and its operators have direct control. We believe Hotel EBITDA provides investors with supplemental information on the on-going operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis. The Company’s calculation of Hotel EBITDA may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI3MTUwMCM2NTc2Njg2IzIwMDYwNDE=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZmIzYjVjOWMtOWU1My00NTU1LWJlYjktMzUzMTEzZjMzNzJjLTEwMTc2MTQ=/tiny/Sotherly-Hotels-Inc-.png)```\nContact at the Company: Mack Sims Vice President – Operations & Investor Relations Sotherly Hotels Inc. 306 South Henry Street, Suite 100 Williamsburg, Virginia 23185 757.229.5648\n```\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/0d30c244-f83e-45a0-bd34-389261843c54/small/sotherly-hotels-inc-logo.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0d30c244-f83e-45a0-bd34-389261843c54)\n\nSource: Sotherly Hotels Inc. \n\n[ View all news ](/financial-info/earnings-releases)\n\nCopyright 2020, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n✓\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\n[AddToAny](https://www.addtoany.com \"Share Buttons\")\n\n[More…](#addtoany \"Show all\")\n"

FFoollssoomm\nTo Our Stockholders:\nFiscal year 2023 was an important transitional year for Sotherly Hotels. At the\noutset of 2023, we completed repayment of all COVID-related mortgage forbearance\nobligations that the Company had incurred over a period of nearly three years.\nAt the same time, we reinstated payment of dividends on all three series of the\nCompany’s preferred stock. In the year, we also repaid a portion of the outstanding\nbalance of accrued and unpaid cumulative dividends owed on our preferred stock.\nThese positive developments were important milestones and achievements for the\nCompany in 2023, as we looked to continue to improve our capital structure.\nThe lodging industry continued to show good growth in 2023, according to analysts’ reports, as national Revenue\nPer Available Room (RevPAR) grew nearly 5% over 2022. Our markets, which focus mainly on major locations in\nthe Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, outpaced the broader national averages. According to STR, Sotherly markets\ngrew RevPAR 11.5% over 2022, more than doubling the national average. Average Daily Rate (ADR) continued to\nbe the major component of RevPAR growth both nationally and in our respective markets. Nearly all of Sotherly’s\nmarkets witnessed positive RevPAR growth in 2023. In some of our markets, RevPAR growth was substantial. In\nArlington Virgina, which is part to the metropolitan Washington D.C. market, the market grew RevPAR 23.4% and\nthe Houston market was up 21.8% in RevPAR. While our overall portfolio recovered fairly quickly coming out of\nthe pandemic, we still have a lot of upside in our portfolio as occupancy is still 730 basis points below 2019. As\nthe markets in Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Houston continue to recover, we anticipate outsized growth, beyond the\nnational averages, for the foreseeable future for our portfolio.\nFiscal year 2023 also saw the continuation of solid gains in both business travel and in the booking of group\nbusiness. Transient leisure travel remained a strong and important component of lodging demand in 2023, although\ntransient demand in our Florida markets softened in the second half of the year. We believe this was due to\nreduced levels of traditional international travel, and the fact that Florida markets were the first to re-open after\nthe pandemic, leading to significant gains in the second half of 2022 that were not sustained in 2023.\nThe stubborn effects of lingering inflation have created challenges for hotel owners nationwide. Operating\nexpenses, labor costs, and increases in taxes and insurance premiums continue to impact hotel margins and\nprofitability. Concurrently, travelers and our franchise partners are once again demanding a return to the high levels\nof service that were expected prior to the pandemic. In 2023, Sotherly reinstated all the traditional amenities\nfound in upper upscale and luxury hotels, including the full array of food and beverage offerings, amenities, and\ndaily housekeeping. These challenges and costs created overall pressure on hotel margins, resulting in total Hotel\nEBITDA underperforming compared to 2022.\nIn 2023, inflation pressures also began to “spill over” into traditional mortgage financing and refinancing. Interest\nrates for hotel mortgage debt are now above 8.0%, nearly twice what the industry paid prior to the pandemic.\nBanks and lenders came under pressure toward the end of 2023, and the lending environment has proven to be a\nTTT UUURRR S SSTTTOOOCCCKKKHHHOOOLLLDDDEEERRRSSS\nOOO O OO\nAA lA el teltetettrtee rfr rf ofrrmoom mS So Stoohtthehreelryrll yHy H oHtooettleesl lsPs PrPerrseeissdiidedneentn t&t && C CECEOEOO D DDavaaivvdiid dR RR.

The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the Company's assets. The partnership\nagreement provides that the Operating Partnership will assume and pay when due, or reimburse the Company for payment of, all costs\nand expenses relating to the ownership and operations of, or for the benefit of, the Operating Partnership. The partnership agreement\nof the Operating Partnership further provides that all expenses of the Company are deemed to be incurred for the benefit of the\nOperating Partnership.\nThis report combines the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 of the Company and the\nOperating Partnership. We believe combining the annual reports into this single report results in the following benefits:\n• combined reports better reflect how management and investors view the business as a single operating unit;\n• combined reports enhance investors’ understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to\nview the business as a whole and in the same manner as management;\n• combined reports are more efficient for the Company and the Operating Partnership and result in savings of time, effort\nand expense; and\n• combined reports are more efficient for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure and providing a single document for\ntheir review.\nTo help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report\npresents the following separate sections for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership:\n• Item 5 – Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n– selected portions;\n• Item 9A – Controls and Procedures;\n• Consolidated Financial Statements;\n• the following Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:\n• Note 6 – Preferred Stock and Units;\n• Note 7 – Common Stock and Units;\n• Note 12 – Earnings (Loss) per Share and per Unit; and\n• Certifications of CEO and CFO Pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n4\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nInformation included and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the\nmeaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, and as such may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results,\nperformance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such\nforward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our current strategies,\nexpectations and future plans, are generally identified by our use of words, such as “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,”\n“project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “potential,” “opportunity,” and similar expressions, whether in the\nnegative or affirmative, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking. All\nstatements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans are forward-looking statements.\nFactors which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future operations, performance and prospects include, but are\nnot limited to:\n• national and local economic and business conditions that affect occupancy rates and revenues at our hotels and the\ndemand for hotel products and services;\n• risks associated with the hotel industry, including competition and new supply of hotel rooms, increases in wages, energy\ncosts and other operating costs;\n• risks associated with the level of our indebtedness and our ability to meet covenants in our debt agreements, and, as\nnecessary, to refinance or seek an extension of the maturity of such indebtedness or further modification of such debt\nagreements on similar or more favorable terms;\n• risks associated with adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes;\n• impacts on the travel industry from pandemic diseases, including COVID-19;\n• the availability and terms of financing and capital and the general volatility of the securities markets;\n• management and performance of our hotels;\n• risks associated with maintaining our system of internal controls;\n• risks associated with the conflicts of interest of the Company’s officers and directors;\n• risks associated with redevelopment and repositioning projects, including delays and cost overruns;\n• supply and demand for hotel rooms in our current and proposed market areas;\n• risks associated with our ability to maintain our franchise agreements with our third party franchisors;\n• our ability to acquire additional properties and the risk that potential acquisitions may not perform in accordance with\nexpectations;\n• our ability to successfully expand into new markets;\n• legislative/regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing taxation of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”);\n• the Company’s ability to maintain its qualification as a REIT and the limitations imposed on the Company's business due\nto such maintenance; and\n• our ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage.\nAdditional factors that could cause actual results to vary from our forward-looking statements are set forth under the Section\ntitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this annual report.\nThese risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statement contained in this report or\nincorporated by reference herein. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any\ndocument incorporated by reference, the date of that document. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements\nattributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. We undertake no\nobligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in\nexpectations after the date of this report, except as required by law. In addition, our past results are not necessarily indicative of our\nfuture results.\n5\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOrganization\nSotherly Hotels Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-managed and self-administered lodging real estate investment trust, or REIT, that\nwas formed in August 2004 to own, acquire, renovate and reposition full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties\nlocated in primary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. On December 21, 2004, the Company successfully\ncompleted its initial public offering and elected to be treated as a self-advised REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Company\nconducts its business through Sotherly Hotels LP, its operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), of which the Company is the\ngeneral partner. As of the filing date, the Company owns approximately 98.2% of the general and limited partnership units in the\nOperating Partnership. Limited partners own the remaining 1.8% limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our portfolio consisted of ten full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels located in\nseven states with an aggregate of 2,786 hotel rooms, and interests in two condominium hotels and their associated rental programs.\nAll of our hotels are wholly-owned by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are managed on a day-to-day basis by Our Town\nHospitality, LLC (“Our Town”). Our portfolio is concentrated in markets that we believe possess multiple demand generators and\nhave significant barriers to entry for new product delivery, which are important factors for us in identifying hotel properties that we\nexpect will be capable of providing strong risk-adjusted returns.\nIn order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, it cannot directly manage or operate our hotels. Therefore, we lease our wholly-\nowned hotel properties to entities that we refer to as our “TRS Lessees”, which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of MHI Hospitality\nTRS Holding, Inc. (“MHI Holding”, and collectively with the TRS Lessees, the “MHI TRS Entities”). The MHI TRS Entities, in turn,\nhave engaged Our Town, which is an eligible independent management company, to manage the day-to-day operations at our hotels.\nMHI Holding is a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) for federal income tax purposes.\nOur corporate office is located at 306 South Henry Street, Suite 100, Williamsburg, Virginia 23185. Our telephone number is\n(757) 229-5648.\nOur Properties\nAs of December 31, 2023, our hotels were located in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and\nTexas. Seven of these hotels operate under franchise agreements with major hotel brands, and three are independent hotels. We also\nown the hotel commercial condominium units of the Hyde Resort & Residences and Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences\ncondominium hotels. See Item 2 in Part I and Item 7 in Part II of this Form 10-K for additional detail on our properties.\nOur Strategy and Investment Criteria\nOur strategy is to grow through acquisitions of full-service, upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in the primary\nmarkets of the southern United States. Sotherly may also opportunistically acquire hotels throughout other regions of the United\nStates. We intend to grow our portfolio through disciplined acquisitions of hotel properties and believe that we will be able to source\nsignificant external growth opportunities through our management team’s extensive network of industry, corporate and institutional\nrelationships. Current market conditions and the terms of our loan agreements limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy, but as\neconomic conditions improve and demand and consumer confidence increase, we intend to position the Company to execute on our\ngrowth strategy. We are not subject to limitations on the amount or percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one\nproperty. Additionally, no limits have been set on the concentration of investments in any one location or facility type. Our policy is to\nacquire assets primarily for income and long-term appreciation.\nOur investment criteria are further detailed below:\n• Geographic Growth Markets: Our growth strategy focuses on the major markets in the Southern region of the United\nStates. Our management team remains confident in the long-term growth potential associated with this part of the United\nStates. We believe these markets have, during the Company’s and our predecessors’ existence, been characterized by\npopulation growth, economic expansion, growth in new businesses and growth in the resort, recreation and leisure\nsegments. We will continue to focus on these markets, including coastal locations, and will investigate other markets for\nacquisitions only if we believe these new markets will provide similar long-term growth prospects. Sotherly may also\nopportunistically acquire hotels throughout the United States.\n• Full-Service Hotels: Our acquisition strategy focuses on the full-service hotel segment. Our full-service hotels fall\nprimarily under the upscale to upper-upscale categories and include such brands as Doubletree by Hilton, Tapestry\n6\nCollection by Hilton, and Hyatt Centric, as well as independent hotels. We may also acquire commercial unit(s) within\nupscale to upper-upscale condominium hotel projects, allowing us to establish and operate unit rental programs. We do\nnot own limited service or extended-stay hotels. We believe that full-service hotels, in the upscale to upper-upscale\ncategories, will outperform the broader U.S. hotel industry, and thus offer the highest returns on invested capital. Sotherly\nmay also opportunistically acquire hotels outside of the full-service, upscale or upper-upscale category.\n• Significant Barriers to Entry: We intend to execute a strategy that focuses on the acquisition of hotels in prime locations\nwith significant barriers to entry.\n• Proximity to Demand Generators: We seek to acquire hotel properties located in central business districts for both leisure\nand business travelers within the respective markets, including large state universities, airports, convention centers,\ncorporate headquarters, sports venues and office buildings. We seek to be in walking locations that are proximate to the\nmarkets’ major demand generators.\nWe generally have a bias toward acquiring underperforming hotels, which we typically define as those that are poorly managed,\nsuffer from significant deferred maintenance and capital investment and that are not properly positioned in their respective markets. In\npursuing these opportunities, we hope to improve revenue and cash flow and increase the long-term value of the underperforming\nhotels we acquire. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a total investment that is substantially less than replacement cost of a hotel or the\nacquisition cost of a market performing hotel. In analyzing a potential investment in an underperforming hotel property, we typically\ncharacterize the investment opportunity as one of the following:\n• Branding Opportunity: The acquisition of properties that includes a repositioning of the property through a change in\nbrand affiliation, which may include positioning the property as an independent hotel. Branding opportunities typically\ninclude physical upgrades and enhanced efficiencies brought about by changes in operations.\n• Shallow-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of an underperforming but structurally sound hotel that requires moderate\nrenovation to re-establish the hotel's appeal in its market.\n• Deep-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of a hotel that is closed or functionally obsolete and requires a restructuring of\nboth the business components of the operations as well as the physical plant of the hotel, including extensive renovation\nof the building, furniture, fixtures and equipment.\nTypically, in our experience, a deep turn opportunity takes a total of approximately four years from the initial acquisition of a\nproperty to achieving full post-renovation stabilization. Therefore, when evaluating future opportunities in underperforming hotels, we\nintend to focus on up-branding and shallow-turn opportunities, and to pursue deep-turn opportunities on a more limited basis and in\njoint venture partnerships, if possible.\nInvestment Vehicles. In pursuit of our investment strategy, we may employ various traditional and non-traditional investment\nvehicles:\n• Direct Purchase Opportunity: Our traditional investment strategy is to acquire direct ownership interests via our\nOperating Partnership in properties that meet our investment criteria, including opportunities that involve full-service,\nupscale and upper-upscale properties in identified geographic growth markets that have significant barriers to entry for\nnew product delivery. Such properties, or portfolio of properties, may or may not be acquired subject to a mortgage, or\nother financing or lending instruments, by the seller or third-party.\n• Joint Venture/Mezzanine Lending Opportunities: We may, from time to time, undertake a significant renovation and\nrehabilitation project that we characterize as a deep-turn opportunity. In such cases, we may acquire a functionally\nobsolete hotel whose renovation may be very lengthy and require significant capital. In these projects, we may choose to\nstructure such acquisitions as a joint venture, or mezzanine lending program, in order to avoid severe short-term dilution\nand loss of current income commonly referred to as the “negative carry” associated with such extensive renovation\nprograms. We will not pursue joint venture or mezzanine programs in which we would become a “de facto” lender to the\nreal estate community.\n• Investments in Mortgages, Structured Financings and Other Lending Policies: In sourcing acquisitions for our core\nturnaround growth strategy, we may pursue investments in debt instruments that are collateralized by underperforming\nhotel properties. In certain circumstances, we believe that owning these debt instruments is a way to (i) ultimately acquire\nthe underlying real estate asset and (ii) provide a non-dilutive current return to the Company’s stockholders in the form of\ninterest payments derived from the ownership of the debt. Our principal goal in pursuing distressed debt opportunities is\nultimately to acquire the underlying real estate. By owning the debt, we believe that we may be in a position to acquire\ndeeds to properties that fit our investment criteria in lieu of foreclosures. We do not have a policy limiting our ability to\ninvest in loans secured by properties or to make loans to other persons. We may consider offering purchase money\nfinancing in connection with the sale of properties where the provision of that financing will increase the value to be\n7\nreceived by us for the property sold. We may make loans to joint ventures in which we may participate in the future.\nHowever, neither Sotherly nor the Operating Partnership intend to engage in significant lending activities.\nPortfolio and Asset Management Strategy\nWe intend to ensure that the management of our hotel properties maximizes market share, as evidenced by revenue per available\nroom (“RevPAR”) penetration indices, and that our market share yields the optimum level of revenues for our hotels in their\nrespective markets. Our strategy is designed to actively monitor our hotels’ operating expenses in an effort to maximize hotel earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Hotel EBITDA”).\nOver our long history in the lodging industry, we have refined many portfolio and asset management techniques that we believe\nprovide for exceptional cash returns at our hotels. We undertake extensive budgeting due diligence wherein we examine market\ntrends, one-time or exceptional revenue opportunities, and/or changes in the regulatory climate that may impact costs. We review\ndaily revenue results and revenue management strategies at the hotels, and we focus on our manager's ability to produce high quality\nrevenues that translate to higher profit margins. We look for ancillary forms of revenues, such as leasing roof-top space for cellular\ntowers and other communication devices and also look to lease space to third parties in our hotels, which may include, but are not\nlimited to, gift shops or restaurants. We have and will continue to engage parking management companies to maximize parking\nrevenue. Our efforts further include periodic review of property insurance costs and coverage, and the cost of real and personal\nproperty taxes. We generally appeal tax increases in an effort to secure lower tax payments and routinely pursue strategies that allow\nfor lower overall insurance costs, such as purchasing re-insurance.\nWe also require detailed and refined reporting data from our hotel manager, which includes detailed accounts of revenues,\nrevenue segments, expenses and forecasts based on current and historic booking patterns. We also believe we optimize and\nsuccessfully manage capital costs at our hotels while ensuring that adequate product standards are maintained to provide a positive\nguest experience.\nNone of our hotels are managed by a major national or global hotel franchise company. Through our long history in the lodging\nindustry, we have found that management of our hotels by management companies other than franchisors is preferable to and more\nprofitable than management services provided by the major franchise companies, specifically with respect to optimization of operating\nexpenses and the delivery of guest service.\nOur portfolio management strategy includes efforts to optimize labor costs. Our hotel manager is responsible for hiring and\nmaintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our hotels, we monitor\nour hotel manager's human resource strategy and make recommendations regarding the operation of our hotels, if appropriate. The\nlabor force in our hotels is predominately non-unionized, with only one property, the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront,\nhaving approximately 67 employees electing to participate under a collective bargaining arrangement. Further, the employees at our\nhotels that are managed by Our Town are eligible to receive health and other insurance coverage through Our Town, which self-\ninsures. Self-insuring has, in our opinion and experience, provided significant savings over traditional insurance company sponsored\nplans.\nAsset Disposition Strategy. When a property no longer fits with our investment objectives, we will pursue a direct sale of the\nproperty for cash so that our investment capital can be redeployed according to the investment strategies outlined above. Where\npossible, we will seek to subsequently purchase a hotel in connection with the requirements of a tax-free exchange. Such a strategy\nmay be deployed in order to mitigate the tax consequence that a direct sale may cause.\nOur Principal Agreements\nManagement Agreements\nOur hotels are managed on a day-to-day basis by Our Town, an eligible independent management company. The base\nmanagement fee for each of our hotels is a percentage of the gross revenues of the hotel and is due monthly. The applicable\npercentages of gross revenue for the base management fee for each of our wholly-owned hotels and our condominium hotel rental\nprograms are shown below:\n8\nCommencement Expiration Percentage\nHotel Name Date Date Fee\nHotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection by January 1, 2020 March 31, 2035\nHilton 2.50%\nThe DeSoto January 1, 2020 March 31, 2035 2.50%\nDoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport January 1, 2020 March 31, 2035 2.50%\nHotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton January 1, 2020 March 31, 2035 2.50%\nDoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront January 1, 2020 March 31, 2035 2.50%\nDoubleTree by Hilton Laurel January 1, 2020 March 31, 2035 2.50%\nGeorgian Terrace January 1, 2020 March 31, 2035 2.50%\nThe Whitehall January 1, 2020 March 31, 2035 2.50%\nCommencement Expiration Years 4-5 &\nHotel Name Date Date Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Renewals\nDoubleTree Resort by Hilton April 1, 2020 March 31, 2035\nHollywood Beach 2.00% 2.25% 2.50% 2.50%\nHyde Resort & Residences April 1, 2020 March 31, 2035 2.00% 2.25% 2.50% 2.50%\nHyde Beach House Resort & April 1, 2020 March 31, 2035\nResidences 2.00% 2.25% 2.50% 2.50%\nHyatt Centric Arlington November 15, 2020 March 31, 2035 2.00% 2.25% 2.50% 2.50%\nAgreements with Our Town. Our Town is the management company for each of our ten wholly-owned hotels, as well as the\nmanager for our two condominium rental programs.\nOn September 6, 2019, we entered into a master agreement with Our Town and the former majority owner of Our Town related\nto the management of certain of our hotels, as amended on December 13, 2019 (as amended, the “OTH Master Agreement”). On\nDecember 13, 2019, and subsequent dates we entered into a series of individual hotel management agreements for the management of\nour hotels. Those hotel management agreements for our ten wholly-owned hotels and the two rental programs are each referred to as\nan “OTH Hotel Management Agreement” and, together, the “OTH Hotel Management Agreements”.\nThe OTH Master Agreement:\n• expires on March 31, 2035, or earlier if all of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements expire or are terminated prior to\nthat date. The OTH Master Agreement shall be extended beyond 2035 for such additional periods as an OTH Hotel\nManagement Agreement remains in effect;\n• requires Our Town to provide dedicated executive level support for our managed hotels pursuant to certain criteria;\n• sets an incentive management fee for each of the hotels managed by Our Town equal to 10% of the amount by which\ngross operating profit, as defined in the OTH Hotel Management Agreements, for a given year exceeds the budgeted gross\noperating profit for such year; provided, however, that the incentive management fee payable in respect of any such year\nshall not exceed 0.25% of the gross revenues of the hotel included in such calculation;\n• provides for an adjustment to the fees payable by us under the OTH Hotel Management Agreements in the event the net\noperating income of Our Town falls below $250,000 for any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2021;\n• provides a mechanism and establishes conditions on which the Company will offer Our Town the opportunity to manage\nhotels acquired by the Company in the future, pursuant to a negotiated form of single facility management agreement,\nwith the caveat that the Company is not required to offer the management of future hotels to Our Town; and\n• sets a base management fee for future hotels of 2.00% for the first year of the term, 2.25% for the second year of the term,\nand 2.50% for the third and any additional years of the term.\n9\nEach of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements has an initial term ending March 31, 2035. Each of the OTH Hotel\nManagement Agreements may be extended for up to two additional periods of five years subject to the approval of both parties with\nrespect to any such extension. The agreements provide that Our Town will be the sole and exclusive manager of the hotels as the\nagent of the respective TRS Lessee, at the sole cost and expense of the TRS Lessee, and subject to certain operating standards. Each\nOTH Hotel Management Agreement may be terminated in connection with a sale of the related hotel. In connection with a\ntermination upon the sale of the hotel, Our Town will be entitled to receive a termination fee equal to the lesser of the management fee\npaid with respect to the prior twelve months or the management fees paid for that number of months prior to the closing date of the\nhotel sale equal to the number of months remaining on the current term of the OTH Hotel Management Agreement. Upon the sale of\na hotel, no termination fee will be due in the event the Company elects to provide Our Town with the opportunity to manage another\ncomparable hotel and Our Town is not precluded from accepting such opportunity. Our Town is required to qualify as an eligible\nindependent contractor in order to permit the Company to continue to operate as a real estate investment trust.\nPursuant to the management agreements for the Hyde Resort & Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences,\nOur Town manages the rental of individually owned condominium units pursuant to rental agreements entered into with individual\ncondominium unit owners. We have also entered into an Association Sub Management and Assignment Agreement with Our Town\nfor the management and operation of the condominium association responsible for the operation of the Hyde Beach House Resort &\nResidences, and a Rental Sales Management Agreement pursuant to which Our Town agreed to manage the marketing and negotiation\nof rental agreements with individual condominium unit owners.\nAs of March 14, 2023, an affiliate of Andrew M. Sims, our Chairman, an affiliate of David R. Folsom, our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Andrew M. Sims Jr., our Vice President - Operations & Investor Relations, beneficially owned approximately\n71.0%, 7.0%, and 15.0%, respectively, of the total outstanding ownership interests in Our Town. Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr.\nSims Jr. serve as directors of Our Town.\nFranchise Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2023, all but three of our wholly-owned hotels operate under franchise licenses from national hotel\ncompanies. As our franchise agreements expire, we will continue to evaluate each hotel on a case-by-case basis and decide whether to\nre-license or re-brand with the existing franchisor, re-brand and license with a new franchisor, or re-brand as an independent hotel.\nWe also periodically review our independent hotels to determine whether they would be better served by operating under a franchise\nlicense.\nOur TRS Lessees hold the franchise licenses for our wholly-owned hotels. Under the terms of each hotel management\nagreement, our hotel manager must operate each of our hotels in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement\nfor the hotel.\nThe franchise licenses generally specify certain management, operational, record keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing\nstandards and procedures with which the franchisee must comply. Under the franchise licenses, the franchisee must comply with the\nfranchisors’ standards and requirements with respect to:\n• training of operational personnel;\n• safety;\n• maintaining specified insurance;\n• the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided;\n• display of signage;\n• marketing standards including print media, billboards, and promotions standards; and\n• the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas.\nAs the franchisee, our TRS Lessees are required to pay franchise/royalty fees, as well as certain other fees for marketing and\nreservations services in amounts that range from approximately 3.0% to 4.0% of gross revenues. The following table sets forth certain\ninformation for the franchise licenses of our wholly-owned hotel properties as of December 31, 2023:\n10\nFranchise/Royalty Expiration\nFee (1) Date\nHotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton 5.0% June 2029\nDoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront 5.0% September 2025\nDoubleTree by Hilton Laurel (2) 4.0% October 2030\nDoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia – Airport 5.0% October 2024\nDoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach 5.0% October 2027\nHotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection by Hilton 5.0% April 2028\nHyatt Centric Arlington 5.0 % March 2038\n(1) Percentage of room revenues payable to the franchisor.\n(2) The Franchise/Royalty Fee is 4.0% for 2024 and 2025, and 5.0% thereafter.\nLease Agreements\nTRS Leases\nIn order for the Company to maintain qualification as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership or its\nsubsidiaries can operate our hotels directly. Our wholly-owned hotels are leased to our TRS Lessees, which have engaged Our Town\nto manage the hotels. Each lease has a non-cancelable term ranging from four to thirty years, subject to earlier termination upon the\noccurrence of certain contingencies described in the lease.\nDuring the term of each lease, our TRS Lessees are obligated to pay a fixed annual base rent plus a percentage rent and certain\nother additional charges. Base rent accrues and is paid monthly. Percentage rent is calculated by multiplying fixed percentages by\ngross room revenues, in excess of certain threshold amounts and is paid monthly or quarterly, according to the terms of the agreement.\nOther Leases\nWe lease the land underlying the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel pursuant to a ground lease. The ground lease requires us to\nmake rental payments of $50,000 per year in base rent and percentage rent equal to 3.5% of gross room revenue in excess of certain\nthresholds, as defined in the ground lease agreement. The ground lease contains a rent reset provision that will reset the rent in June\n2025 to a fixed amount per annum equal to 8.0% of the land value, subject to an appraisal process. The initial term of the ground\nlease expires in 2035 and may be extended by us for four additional renewal periods of 10 years each. In order to sell the Hyatt\nCentric Arlington hotel and assign our leasehold interest in the ground lease, we are required to obtain the consent of the third-party\nlessor.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences hotel commercial condominium unit in 2019,\nwe entered into a 20-year parking and cabana management agreement for the parking garage and poolside cabanas associated with the\nresort. In exchange for rights to the parking and cabana revenue, we pay the condominium association an annual payment of $271,000\nfor the initial five years of the term, with 5.0% increases on every fifth year of the term.\nWe lease approximately 8,500 square feet of commercial office space in Williamsburg, Virginia for our corporate offices, under\nan agreement with a ten-year term beginning January 1, 2020. The initial annual rent under the agreement is $218,875, with the rent\nfor each successive annual period increasing by 3.0% over the prior annual period’s rent. The annual rent was offset by a tenant\nimprovement allowance of $200,000, applied against one-half of each monthly rent payment until the tenant improvement allowance\nwas exhausted in 2021. Effective January 1, 2024, the landlord agreed to a reduction in rent of 1/3rd.\nTax Status\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the “Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004. In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the\nCompany must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute, as\n“qualifying distributions,” at least 90.0% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by\nexcluding its net capital gains and reduced by certain non-cash items) to its stockholders. The Company has adhered to these\nrequirements each taxable year since its formation in 2004 and intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain its\nqualification for taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that\nportion of its taxable income (including its net capital gain) that is distributed to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify for\ntaxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and no relief provision applies, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate\nrates and it would be disqualified from re-electing treatment as a REIT until the fifth taxable year after the year in which it failed to\n11\nqualify as a REIT. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its\nincome and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from\nnon-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.\nWhile the Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes, the unit holders of the Operating\nPartnership, including the Company, are subject to tax on their respective allocable shares of the Operating Partnership’s taxable\nincome.\nThe Company has one TRS, MHI Holding, in which it owns an interest through the Operating Partnership. MHI Holding is\nsubject to federal, state and local income taxes. MHI Holding has operated at a cumulative taxable loss, through December 31, 2023,\nof approximately $48.6 million and deferred timing differences of approximately $2.2 million attributable to accrued, but not\ndeductible, vacation and sick pay amounts, business interest, depreciation and other timing differences. Neither the Company nor MHI\nHolding has incurred federal income taxes since its formation. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipation of\nsignificant losses to MHI Holding, we reduced our deferred tax asset through the establishment of a 100% valuation allowance. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we have a valuation allowance of approximately $13.0 million.\nEnvironmental Matters\nIn connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances\nand regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be\nliable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in such property. Such laws often\nimpose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic\nsubstances. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate such\ncontaminated property properly, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to borrow using such property as collateral. Furthermore, a\nperson who arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance at a property owned by another, or who transports\nsuch substance to or from such property, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substance released into the\nenvironment at the disposal or treatment facility. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the\npresence of such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as\ncollateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we may be potentially liable for such costs.\nWe believe that our hotels are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances\nand regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on us. We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance,\nliability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our present hotel\nproperties.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed nine full-time persons, all of whom work at our corporate office in Williamsburg,\nVirginia. We believe relations with our employees are positive. Our human capital resources objectives include attracting and\nretaining talented and well-qualified employees. Our compensation program, including competitive salaries and other benefits, are\ndesigned to attract, hire, retain and motivate highly qualified employees and executives. We are committed to enhancing our culture\nthrough efforts to promote and preserve inclusion and by providing and maintaining a safe work environment. All persons employed\nin the day-to-day operations of each of our hotels are employees of our third-party hotel manager engaged by our TRS Lessees to\noperate such hotels.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain an Internet site, http://www.sotherlyhotels.com, which contains additional information concerning Sotherly Hotels\nInc. We make available free of charge through our Internet site all our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,\ncurrent reports on Form 8-K, definitive proxy statements and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon\nas reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. We\nhave also posted on this website the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and the charters of the Company’s Nominating, Corporate\nGovernance and Compensation Committee (“NCGC Committee”) and Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors. We\nintend to disclose on our website any changes to, or waivers from, the Company’s Code of Business Conduct.

Significant adverse changes in the operations of any one hotel could have a material adverse effect on our financial\nperformance and, accordingly, on our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\nWe are subject to risks of increased hotel operating expenses and decreased hotel revenues.\nOur leases with our TRS Lessees provide for the payment of rent based in part on gross revenues from our hotels. Our TRS\nLessees are subject to hotel operating risks including decreased hotel revenues and increased hotel operating expenses, including but\nnot limited to the following:\n• wage and benefit costs;\n• repair and maintenance expenses;\n• energy costs;\n• insurance costs; and\n• other operating expenses.\nAny increases in these operating expenses can have a significant adverse impact on our TRS Lessees’ ability to pay rent and\nother operating expenses and, consequently, our earnings and cash flow.\nIn keeping with our investment strategy, we may acquire, renovate and/or re-brand hotels in new or existing geographic markets as\npart of our repositioning strategy. Unanticipated expenses and insufficient demand for newly repositioned hotels could adversely\naffect our financial performance and our ability to comply with loan covenants and to make distributions to the Company’s\nstockholders.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, develop or acquire hotels in geographic areas in which our management may have\nlittle or no operating experience. Additionally, those properties may also be renovated and re-branded as part of a repositioning\nstrategy. Potential customers may not be familiar with our newly renovated hotel or be aware of the brand change. As a result, we may\nhave to incur costs relating to the opening, operation and promotion of those new hotel properties that are substantially greater than\nthose incurred in other geographic areas. These hotels may attract fewer customers than expected and we may choose to increase\nspending on advertising and marketing to promote the hotel and increase customer demand. Unanticipated expenses and insufficient\ndemand at new hotel properties, therefore, could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to comply with loan\ncovenants and to make distributions to the Company’s stockholders.\nWe do not have the authority to require any hotel to be operated in a particular manner or to govern any particular aspect of the\ndaily operations of any hotel and as a result, our returns are dependent on the management of our hotels by our hotel management\ncompany.\nSince federal income tax laws restrict REITs and their subsidiaries from operating or managing hotels, we do not operate or\nmanage our hotels. Instead, we lease all of our hotels to our TRS Lessees, and our TRS Lessees retain managers to operate our hotels\npursuant to management agreements. All of our hotels currently are managed by Our Town.\nUnder the terms of our management agreements with our hotel manager and the REIT qualification rules, our ability to\nparticipate in operating decisions regarding the hotels is limited. We will depend on our hotel manager to operate our hotels as\nprovided in the management agreements. We do not have the authority to require any hotel to be operated in a particular manner or to\ngovern any particular aspect of the daily operations of any hotel. Thus, even if we believe our hotels are being operated inefficiently or\nin a manner that does not result in satisfactory occupancy rates, RevPAR, and average daily rates (“ADR”), we may not be able to\nforce a hotel management company to change its method of operating our hotels. Additionally, in the event that we need to replace the\nmanager of one or more of our hotels, we may be required by the terms of the applicable management agreement to pay substantial\ntermination fees and may experience significant disruptions at the affected hotels.\n15\nOur ability to make distributions to the Company’s stockholders is subject to fluctuations in our financial performance, operating\nresults and capital improvement requirements.\nAs a REIT, the Company is required to distribute, as “qualifying distributions,” at least 90.0% of its REIT taxable income\n(determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding its net capital gains, and reduced by certain noncash\nitems), each year to the Company’s stockholders. However, several factors may make us unable to declare or pay distributions to the\nCompany’s stockholders, including poor operating results and financial performance or unanticipated capital improvements to our\nhotels, including capital improvements that may be required by our franchisors.\nWe lease all of our hotels to our TRS Lessees. Our TRS Lessees are subject to hotel operating risks, including risks of sustaining\noperating losses after payment of hotel operating expenses, including management fees. Among the factors which could cause our\nTRS Lessees to fail to make required rent payments are reduced net operating profits or operating losses, increased debt service\nrequirements and capital expenditures at our hotels, including capital expenditures required by the franchisors of our hotels. Among\nthe factors that could reduce the net operating profits of our TRS Lessees are decreases in hotel revenues and increases in hotel\noperating expenses. Hotel revenue can decrease for a number of reasons, including increased competition from a new supply of hotel\nrooms and decreased demand for hotel rooms. These factors can reduce both occupancy and room rates at our hotels and limit the\nvolume of food and beverage revenue and other operating revenue such as parking revenue.\nThe declaration of distributions to holders of our securities is subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s board of directors,\nwhich will consider, among other factors, our financial performance, debt service obligations, debt covenants and capital expenditure\nrequirements. We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash to fund distributions. We have not paid any common stock\ndividend distributions following the payment of dividends in January 2020. Once the payment of all preferred dividends in arrears has\nbeen made, the Company may make the common stock dividend distribution that was declared in January 2020 to shareholders of\nrecord on March 13, 2020.\nGeographic concentration of our hotels makes our business vulnerable to economic downturns in the mid-Atlantic and southern\nUnited States.\nOur hotels are located in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. As a result, economic conditions in the mid-Atlantic and\nsouthern United States significantly affect our revenues and the value of our hotels to a greater extent than if we had a more\ngeographically diversified portfolio. Business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other similar\nfactors that may adversely affect the economic climate in these areas could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Any\nresulting oversupply or reduced demand for hotels in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States and in our markets in particular\nwould therefore have a disproportionate negative impact on our revenues and limit our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\nA substantial number of our hotels operate under brands owned by Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.(\"Hilton\"); therefore, we are\nsubject to risks associated with concentrating our portfolio in one brand. We also own a hotel operated under the brand owned by\nHyatt Hotels Corporation (\"Hyatt\").\nIn our portfolio, the majority of the hotels that we owned as of December 31, 2023, utilize brands owned by Hilton. As a result,\nour success is dependent in part on the continued success of Hilton and their respective brands. If market recognition or the positive\nperception of Hilton is reduced or compromised, the goodwill associated with the Hilton branded hotels in our portfolio may be\nadversely affected, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability\nto make distributions to our stockholders. As of March 1, 2024, we owned one property that utilizes a brand owned by Hyatt. Our\nsuccess is also dependent in part on the continued success, market recognition, and positive perception of these brands.\nOur ground lease for the Hyatt Centric Arlington may constrain us from acting in the best interest of stockholders or require us to\nmake certain payments.\nThe Hyatt Centric Arlington is subject to a ground lease with a third-party lessor which requires us to obtain the consent of the\nrelevant third-party lessor in order to sell the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel or to assign our leasehold interest in the ground lease.\nAccordingly, we may be prevented from completing such a transaction if we are unable to obtain the required consent from the lessor,\neven if we determine that the sale of this hotel or the assignment of our leasehold interest in the ground lease is in the best interest of\nthe Company or our stockholders. In addition, at any given time, potential purchasers may be less interested in buying a hotel subject\nto a ground lease and may demand a lower price for the hotel than for a comparable property without such a restriction, or they may\nnot purchase the hotel at any price. For these reasons, we may have a difficult time selling the hotel or may receive lower proceeds\nfrom any such sale. The ground lease is subject to four additional renewal periods of 10 years each, following the first renewal period\nwhich expires in 2035. At the beginning of each renewal period, certain provisions of the lease may be adjusted by the lessor, which\ncould impact payments we are required to make to the lessor. The ground lease contains a rent reset provision that will reset the rent\nin June 2025 to a fixed amount per annum equal to 8.0% of the land value, subject to an appraisal process. If we are not able to come\n16\nto reasonable terms with the lessor at the end of the term or if we are found to have breached certain obligations under the ground\nlease, the hotel may suffer a substantial decline in value and we may be forced to dispose of the hotel at a substantial loss.\nHedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect us and our hedges may fail to protect us from the losses that the\nhedges were designed to offset.\nSubject to maintaining the Company’s qualification as a REIT, we may elect to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility\nby using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as cap agreements and swap agreements. These agreements involve the risks that\nthese arrangements may fail to protect or adversely affect us because, among other things:\n• interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;\n• available interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;\n• the financial instruments we select may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risk;\n• the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability;\n• the credit quality of the hedging counterparty owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it\nimpairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and\n• the hedging counterparty owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay.\nAs a result of any of the foregoing, our hedging transactions, which are intended to limit losses, may fail to protect us from the\nlosses that the hedges were designed to offset and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur investment opportunities and growth prospects may be affected by competition for acquisitions.\nWe compete for investment opportunities with other entities, some of which have substantially greater financial resources than\nwe do. This competition may generally limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us, which may limit our ability\nto grow. This competition may also increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for\nus to acquire new properties on attractive terms, or at all.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or\nprevent fraud. As a result, the Company’s stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which could harm our\nbusiness and the value of the Company’s shares.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Section 404 of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting. Our internal\ncontrols and financial reporting are not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have undertaken substantial work to maintain effective internal controls, we cannot be certain\nthat we will be successful in maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting and financial processes in the future.\nIn the future, we may discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Furthermore, as we grow our business, our\ninternal controls will become more complex, and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain\neffective. If we or our independent auditors discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could\nreduce the market value of the Company’s shares and make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital. Additionally, the\nexistence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur\nsignificant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to\nremediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner.\nWe and our hotel manager rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or\nsecurity failure of that technology could harm our business.\nWe and our hotel manager rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and\nstore electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records,\npersonal identifying information, reservations, billing and operating data. We and our hotel manager purchase some of our information\ntechnology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We and our hotel manager rely on commercially available systems, software,\ntools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential operator and other customer\ninformation, such as individually identifiable information, including information relating to financial accounts. Although we and our\nhotel manager have taken steps we believe are necessary to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in\nthose systems, it is possible that the safety and security measures taken will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning\nor damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security\n17\nbreaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system\ndisruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper functionality, security\nand availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or\nregulatory penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our hotel\nmanager carries cyber insurance policies to protect and offset a portion of potential costs incurred from a security breach.\nAdditionally, we currently have cyber risk coverage to provide supplemental coverage above the coverage carried by our hotel\nmanager. Despite various precautionary steps to protect our hotels from losses resulting from cyber-attacks, any cyber-attack\noccurrence could still result in losses at our properties, which could affect our results of operations. We are not aware of any cyber\nincidents that we believe to be material or that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. We also rely on the reservation systems of our brand partners and others to transmit and manage customer and payment\ninformation. Those systems may be hacked or subject to denial of service attacks which in turn may result in losses at our properties.\nWe face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which can include more\nfrequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our hotels,\noperations and business. Over time, our coastal markets are expected to experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels\ncausing damage to our properties. As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be\nfully covered by insurance. Other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access\nto the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs, which may subject those hotels to additional regulatory\nburdens, such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards. Climate change also may affect our business by\nincreasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events,\nincreasing operating costs at our hotels, such as the cost of water or energy, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and\nprotect our hotels against such risks. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our\nhotels, operations or business.\nOur investments and business activities are restricted by the applicable REIT laws.\nAs a REIT, the Company is subject to various restrictions on the types of revenues it can earn, assets it can own and activities in\nwhich it can engage. Business activities that could be restricted by applicable REIT laws include, but are not limited to, developing\nalternative uses of real estate and the ownership of hotels that are not leased to a TRS, including the development and/or sale of\ntimeshare or condominium units or the related land parcels. Due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will continue to conduct\ncertain business activities through MHI Holding. MHI Holding is taxable as a C corporation and is subject to federal, state, local, and,\nif applicable, foreign taxation on its taxable income.\nRisks Related to the Lodging Industry\nIf the economy falls into a recessionary period or fails to maintain positive growth, our operating performance and financial\nresults may be harmed by declines in occupancy, average daily room rates and/or other operating revenues.\nThe performance of the lodging industry and the general economy historically have been closely linked. In an economic\ndownturn, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce costs by limiting travel and/or reducing costs on their trips. Our hotels,\nwhich are all full-service hotels, may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue, as compared to hotels in other categories that have\nlower room rates. A decrease in demand for hotel stays and hotel services, such as the decrease experienced due to COVID-19, will\nnegatively affect our operating revenues, which will lower our cash flow and may affect our ability to make distributions to\nstockholders and to maintain compliance with our loan obligations. An economic downturn, such as the one caused by COVID-19,\nmay result in losses or reduce our income in the future. A weakening of the economy may adversely and materially affect our industry,\nbusiness and results of operations and we cannot predict the likelihood, severity or duration of any such downturn. Moreover, reduced\nrevenues as a result of a weakening economy may also reduce our working capital and impact our long-term business strategy.\nOur ability to comply with the terms of our loan covenants, our ability to make distributions to the Company’s stockholders and the\nvalue of our hotels in general, may be adversely affected by factors in the lodging industry.\nOperating Risks\nOur hotel properties are subject to various operating risks common to the lodging industry, many of which are beyond our\ncontrol, including the following:\n• competition from other hotel properties in our markets;\n• over-building of hotels in our markets, which adversely affects occupancy and revenues at our hotels;\n• dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism;\n18\n• increases in energy costs and other expenses affecting travel, which may affect travel patterns and reduce the number of\nbusiness and commercial travelers and tourists;\n• increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors, including increases in labor costs, that may not be offset by\nincreased room rates;\n• changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of debt financing;\n• changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance\nwith laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;\n• adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions;\n• adverse effects of a downturn in the lodging industry; and\n• risks generally associated with the ownership of hotel properties and real estate, as we discuss in detail below.\nThese factors could reduce the net income of our TRS Lessees, which in turn could adversely affect the value of our hotels and\nour ability to comply with the terms of the indenture and to make distributions to the Company’s stockholders.\nSeasonality of the Hotel Business\nThe lodging industry is seasonal in nature, which can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues. Our quarterly\nearnings may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, including weather conditions and poor economic factors. As a\nresult, we may have to enter into short-term borrowings in certain quarters in order to offset these fluctuations in revenues and to make\ndistributions to the Company’s stockholders.\nInvestment Concentration in Particular Segments of a Single Industry\nOur entire business is lodging-related. Therefore, a downturn in the lodging industry, in general, and the full-service, upscale\nand upper-upscale segments in which we operate, in particular, will have a material adverse effect on the value of our hotels, our\nfinancial condition and the extent to which cash may be available for distribution to the Company’s stockholders.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur hotel properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements, including replacements, from time\nto time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. The franchisors of our hotels also require us to make periodic capital improvements as a\ncondition of keeping the franchise licenses. In addition, several of our mortgage lenders require that we set aside amounts for capital\nimprovements to the secured properties on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we spent\napproximately $8.2 million and approximately $8.0 million, respectively, on capital improvements to our hotels. Capital\nimprovements and renovation projects may give rise to the following risks:\n• possible environmental problems;\n• construction cost overruns and delays;\n• a possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these\ncapital improvements may not be available to us on affordable terms; and\n• uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun.\nThe costs of all these capital improvements as well as future capital improvements could adversely affect our financial condition\nand amounts available for distribution to the Company’s stockholders.\nOperating our hotels under franchise agreements could increase our operating costs and lower our net income.\nMost of our hotels operate under franchise agreements which subject us to risks in the event of negative publicity related to one\nof our franchisors.\nThe maintenance of the franchise licenses for our hotels is subject to our franchisors’ operating standards and other terms and\nconditions. Many operating standards and other terms can be modified or expanded at the sole discretion of the franchisor. Our\nfranchisors periodically inspect our hotels to ensure that we, our TRS Lessees, and our management company follow their standards.\nFailure by us, our TRS Lessees or our management company to maintain these standards or other terms and conditions could result in\na franchise license being canceled. If a franchise license terminates due to our failure to make required improvements or to otherwise\ncomply with its terms, we may also be liable to the franchisor for a termination payment, which varies by franchisor and by hotel. As a\n19\ncondition of continuing a franchise license, a franchisor may require us to make capital expenditures, even if we do not believe the\ncapital improvements are necessary or desirable or will result in an acceptable return on our investment. Nonetheless, we may risk\nlosing a franchise license if we do not make franchisor-required capital expenditures.\nIf a franchisor terminates the franchise license, we may try either to obtain a suitable replacement franchise license or to operate\nthe hotel without a franchise license. The loss of a franchise license could significantly decrease the revenues at the hotel and reduce\nthe underlying value of the hotel because of the loss of associated name recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation\nsystems provided by the franchisor. A loss of a franchise license for one or more hotels could materially and adversely affect our\nrevenues. This loss of revenues could, therefore, also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, our ability to\ncomply with the terms of the loan covenants and reduce our cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of our franchise agreements contain provisions that may operate to limit our ability to sell or\nrefinance our hotels, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFranchise agreements typically contain covenants that may affect our ability to sell or refinance a hotel, including requirements\nto obtain the consent of the franchisor in the event of such a sale or refinancing transaction. In the event that a franchisor’s consent is\nnot forthcoming, the terms of a sale or refinancing may be less favorable to us than would otherwise be the case. Some of our\nfranchise agreements provide the franchisor with a right of first offer in the event of certain sales or transfers of a hotel and provide\nthat the franchisor has the right to approve any change in the hotel management company engaged to manage the hotel. Generally, we\nmay be limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the franchisor and the\ntransferee agrees to assume the related franchise agreements. If the franchisor does not consent to the sale or financing of our hotels,\nwe may be unable to consummate transactions that are in our best interests or the terms of those transactions may be less favorable to\nus, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the execution of our strategies.\nHotel re-development is subject to timing, budgeting and other risks that would increase our operating costs and limit our ability to\nmake distributions to stockholders.\nWe intend to acquire hotel properties from time to time as suitable opportunities arise, taking into consideration general\neconomic conditions, and seek to re-develop or reposition these hotels. Redevelopment of hotel properties involves a number of risks,\nincluding risks associated with:\n• construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs;\n• receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations;\n• development costs incurred for projects that are not pursued to completion;\n• acts of God such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or fires that could adversely impact a project;\n• financing; and\n• governmental restrictions on the nature or size of a project.\nWe cannot assure you that any re-development project will be completed on time or within budget. Our inability to complete a\nproject on time or within budget would increase our operating costs and reduce our net income.\nThe hotel business is capital intensive and our inability to obtain financing could limit our growth.\nOur hotel properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Acquisitions or\ndevelopment of additional hotel properties will require significant capital expenditures. In addition, several of our mortgage lenders\nrequire that we set aside annual amounts for capital improvements to the secured property. We may not be able to fund capital\nimprovements or acquisitions solely from cash provided from our operating activities because we must distribute at least 90.0% of our\nREIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year to maintain our REIT tax status. As a result, our ability to fund significant\ncapital expenditures, acquisitions or hotel development through retained earnings is very limited. Consequently, we rely upon the\navailability of debt or equity capital to fund any significant investments or capital improvements. Our ability to grow through\nacquisitions or development of hotels will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing which will depend on\nmarket conditions. Neither our charter nor our bylaws limit the amount of debt that we can incur. However, we cannot assure you that\nwe will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms.\n20\nUninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to the\nCompany’s stockholders.\nWe maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our hotel properties, including liability, fire and extended coverage, of the\ntype and amount we believe are customarily obtained for or by hotel owners. There are no assurances that current coverage will\ncontinue to be available at reasonable rates. Various types of catastrophic losses, like hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, such as\nHurricane Ian in September 2022, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August and September 2017, respectively, Hurricane Matthew in\nOctober 2016 and Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, losses from foreign terrorist activities, such as those on September 11, 2001,\nlosses from power outages or losses from domestic terrorist activities, such as the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, may not\nbe insurable or may not be economically insurable. Currently, our insurers provide terrorism coverage in conjunction with the\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program sponsored by the federal government through which insurers are able to receive compensation for\ninsured losses resulting from acts of terrorism.\nIn the event of a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or\nreplacement cost of our lost investment. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a\nportion of the capital we have invested in a hotel, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, we might\nnevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Inflation, changes in\nbuilding codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to\nreplace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under those circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive\nmight be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property.\nNoncompliance with governmental regulations could adversely affect our operating results.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur hotels may be subject to environmental liabilities. An owner of real property can face liability for environmental\ncontamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We may face liability regardless of:\n• our knowledge of the contamination;\n• the timing of the contamination;\n• the cause of the contamination; or\n• the party responsible for the contamination of the property.\nThere may be unknown environmental problems associated with our properties. If environmental contamination exists on our\nproperties, we could become subject to strict, joint and several liability for the contamination by virtue of our ownership interest.\nThe presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur\nsubstantial remediation costs. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect\non our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to comply with our covenants and to pay distributions to\nstockholders.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Other Changes in Governmental Rules and Regulations\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), all public accommodations must meet various federal\nrequirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA’s requirements could require removal of access\nbarriers, and non-compliance could result in the U.S. government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damages. If we are\nrequired to make substantial modifications to our hotels, whether to comply with the ADA or other changes in governmental rules and\nregulations, our financial condition, results of operations and ability to comply with the terms of our loan covenants and to make\ndistributions to the Company’s stockholders could be adversely affected.\nOur hotels may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities which could cause us to incur substantial costs.\nThe hotel properties that we acquire may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or\nonly limited recourse, against the sellers. Contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might\ninclude:\n• liabilities for environmental conditions;\n• losses in excess of our insured coverage;\n• accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business;\n21\n• tax, legal and regulatory liabilities;\n• claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the Company’s predecessors prior to our acquisition\ntransactions that had not been asserted or were unknown prior to the Company’s acquisition transactions; and\n• claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of\nour properties.\nIn general, the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements related to the sales of the hotel\nproperties may not survive the closing of the transactions. While we will likely seek to require the sellers to indemnify us with respect\nto breaches of representations and warranties that survive, such indemnification may be limited and subject to various materiality\nthresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts\nwith respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. In addition, the total amount of costs and\nexpenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with these hotels may exceed our expectations, and we may\nexperience other unanticipated adverse effects, all of which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our\nability to make distributions to the Company’s stockholders.\nFuture terrorist activities may adversely affect, and create uncertainty in, our business.\nTerrorism in the United States or elsewhere could have an adverse effect on our business, although the degree of impact will\ndepend on a number of factors, including the U.S. and global economies and global financial markets. Previous terrorist attacks in the\nUnited States and subsequent terrorism alerts have adversely affected the travel and hospitality industries in the past. Such attacks, or\nthe threat of such attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to finance our business, our ability to insure\nour properties and/or our results of operations and financial condition, as a whole.\nWe face risks related to pandemic diseases, including COVID-19 and its variants, which could materially and adversely affect\ntravel and result in reduced demand for our hotels.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by the effect of a pandemic disease on the travel industry. For example,\nthe outbreaks of SARS and avian flu in 2003 had a severe impact on the travel industry, the outbreaks of H1N1 flu in 2009 threatened\nto have a similar impact, the perceived threat of a Zika virus outbreak in 2016 had an impact on the south Florida market, and the\nCOVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the travel industry. A prolonged recurrence of COVID-19, SARS, avian flu, H1N1 flu,\nEbola virus, Zika virus or another pandemic disease also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on\ntravel. Any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for our hotels and adversely affect our financial conditions and\nresults of operations.\nHeightened focus on corporate responsibility, specifically related to ESG practices, may impose additional costs and expose the\nCompany to new risks.\nCompanies across industries face increasing scrutiny from various stakeholders on how they address a variety of Environmental,\nSocial and Governance (“ESG”) matters. Potential and current employees, hotel brands, hotel management companies and vendors\nmay consider these factors when establishing and extending business relationships and hotel guests may consider these factors when\nchoosing a hotel. With this increased focus, public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected. The focus\non and activism around ESG and related matters may constrain business operations or cause the Company to incur additional costs.\nThe Company may face reputational damage in the event the Company’s corporate responsibility initiatives do not meet the standards\nset by various constituencies, including those of third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports. Furthermore, if\ncompetitors outperform the Company in such metrics, potential or current investors may elect to invest with the Company’s\ncompetitors, and employees, hotel brands, hotel management companies, vendors and guests may choose not to do business with the\nCompany, which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, the market price of its common\nshares and ability to raise capital. In addition, the SEC is currently evaluating potential new ESG disclosure and other requirements\nthat would impact the Company.\nAs the Company continues to invest and focus on ESG practices that the Company believes are appropriate for its business, the\nCompany could also be criticized by ESG detractors for the scope or nature of its initiatives or goals. The Company could be\nsubjected to negative responses of governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment), hotel brands,\nhotel management companies and hotel guests, that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n22\nGeneral Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our\nproperties and harm our financial condition.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more hotel properties in our portfolio in\nresponse to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited.\nThe real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:\n• adverse changes in international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions;\n• changes in interest rates and in the cost and terms of debt financing;\n• absence of liquidity in credit markets which limits the availability and amount of debt financing;\n• changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance\nwith laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;\n• the ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures;\n• changes in operating expenses; and\n• civil unrest, acts of war or terrorism and the consequences of terrorist acts, acts of God, including earthquakes, hurricanes,\nfloods and other natural disasters, which may result in uninsured losses.\nWe may decide to sell our hotels in the future. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel property for the price\nor on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also\ncannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a hotel property.\nWe may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a hotel property can be sold. We cannot\nassure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a hotel property, we\nmay agree to lock-out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions,\nsuch as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These factors and any others that would\nimpede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our\noperating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to comply with the terms of the indenture and to pay distributions to\nstockholders.\nFuture acquisitions may not yield the returns expected, may result in disruptions to our business, may strain management\nresources and may result in stockholder dilution.\nOur business strategy may not ultimately be successful and may not provide positive returns on our investments. Acquisitions\nmay cause disruptions in our operations and divert management’s attention away from day-to-day operations. The issuance of equity\nsecurities in connection with any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to the Company’s stockholders.\nOur hotels may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating\nthe problem.\nWhen excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture\nproblem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants.\nConcern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and\nsymptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us\nto undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property, which would reduce our cash\navailable for distribution. In addition, the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our guests, employees or the\nmanagement company and others if property damage or health concerns arise and could harm our reputation.\nIncreases in property taxes would increase our operating costs, reduce our income and adversely affect our ability to make\ndistributions to the Company’s stockholders.\nEach of our hotel properties is subject to real and personal property taxes. These taxes may increase as tax rates change and as\nthe properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. If property taxes increase, our financial condition, results of operations\nand our ability to make distributions to the Company’s stockholders could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of\nthe Company’s shares could decline.\n23\nRisks Related to Our Debt\nWe have substantial financial leverage.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the aggregate principal balances of our mortgages and unsecured debt amounted to approximately\n$318.9 million, not accounting for reductions of unamortized premiums or deferred financing costs as shown on our balance sheet.\nHistorically, we have incurred debt for acquisitions and to fund our renovation, redevelopment and rebranding programs. Limitations\nupon our access to additional debt could adversely affect our ability to fund these programs or acquire hotels in the future.\nOur financial leverage could negatively affect our business and financial results, including the following:\n• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing\nfunds available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, paying dividends or\nother purposes;\n• limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, renovation, redevelopment and rebranding plans,\nacquisitions, debt service requirements and other purposes;\n• adversely affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations, including those related to our loan covenants;\n• limit our ability to refinance existing debt;\n• require us to agree to additional restrictions and limitations on our business operations and capital structure to obtain\nfinancing or to modify the terms of existing obligations;\n• force us to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms;\n• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, and to interest rate fluctuations;\n• force us to issue additional equity, possibly on terms unfavorable to existing stockholders;\n• limit our flexibility to make, or react to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n• place us at a competitive disadvantage, compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nWe must comply with financial covenants in our mortgage loan agreements.\nOur mortgage loan agreements contain various financial covenants. Failure to comply with these financial covenants could\nresult from, among other things, changes in the local competitive environment, general economic conditions and disruption caused by\nrenovation activity or major weather disturbances.\nIf we violate the financial covenants contained in our mortgage loan agreements, we may attempt to negotiate waivers of the\nviolations or amend the terms of the applicable mortgage loan agreement with the lender; however, we can make no assurance that we\nwould be successful in any such negotiation or that, if successful in obtaining waivers or amendments, such waivers or amendments\nwould be on attractive terms. Some mortgage loan agreements provide alternate cure provisions which may allow us to otherwise\ncomply with the financial covenants by obtaining an appraisal of the hotel, prepaying a portion of the outstanding indebtedness or by\nproviding cash collateral until such time as the financial covenants are met by the collateralized property without consideration of the\ncash collateral. Alternate cure provisions which include prepaying a portion of the outstanding indebtedness or providing cash\ncollateral may have a material impact on our liquidity.\nIf we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment or satisfy alternate cure provisions, if any, or unable to meet any alternate\ncure requirements and a default were to occur, we would possibly have to refinance the debt through debt financing, private or public\nofferings of debt securities, additional equity financing, or by disposing of an asset. We are uncertain whether we will be able to\nrefinance these obligations or if refinancing terms will be favorable.\n24\nWe have four mortgage debt obligations maturing in 2024 and 2025 and if we are not successful in extending the terms of this\nindebtedness or in refinancing this debt on acceptable economic terms or at all, our overall financial condition could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nWe will be required to seek additional capital in the near future to refinance or replace existing long-term mortgage debt that is\nmaturing. The ability to refinance or replace mortgage debt is subject to market conditions and could become limited in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain future financings on acceptable terms, if at all. In April 2024, the mortgage\non the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport matures. In July 2024 the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville\nRiverfront matures. In June 2025, the mortgage on the Georgian Terrace matures. In October 2025, the mortgage on the DoubleTree\nResort by Hilton Hollywood Beach matures. We also have additional significant obligations maturing in subsequent years. The total\naggregate amount of our debt obligations scheduled to mature in 2024, inclusive of monthly principal and interest amortization of all\nour indebtedness, not including lease obligations, is approximately $71.9 million, which represents approximately 19.1% of our total\ndebt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2023. The total aggregate amount of our debt obligations scheduled to mature in\n2025, inclusive of monthly principal amortization of all our mortgage indebtedness, is approximately $91.4 million, which represents\napproximately 24.2% of our total debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2023. The total aggregate amount of our debt\nobligations scheduled to mature in 2026, inclusive of monthly principal amortization of all our mortgage indebtedness, is\napproximately $58.6 million, which represents approximately 15.5% of our total debt obligations outstanding as of December 31,\n2023.\nWe will need to, and plan to, renew, replace or extend our long-term indebtedness prior to the respective maturity date. If we are\nunable to extend our maturing loans, we may be required to repay the outstanding principal amount at maturity or a portion of such\nindebtedness upon refinance. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay any portion of the indebtedness, it may be necessary to raise\ncapital through debt financing, private or public offerings of debt securities or equity financings. We are uncertain whether we will be\nable to refinance this obligation or if refinancing terms will be favorable. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or\nother factors result in higher interest rates on refinancing, increases in interest expense would lower our cash flow, and, consequently,\ncash available to meet our financial obligations. If we are unable to obtain alternative or additional financing arrangements in the\nfuture, or if we cannot obtain financing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business strategies or we may be\nforced to dispose of hotel properties on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses and potentially reducing cash flow from\noperating activities if the sale proceeds in excess of the amount required to satisfy the indebtedness could not be reinvested in equally\nprofitable real property investments. Moreover, the terms of any additional financing may restrict our financial flexibility, including\nthe debt we may incur in the future, or may restrict our ability to manage our business as we had intended. To the extent we cannot\nrepay our outstanding debt, we risk losing some or all of our hotel properties to foreclosure and we could be required to invoke\ninsolvency proceedings including, but not limited to, commencing a voluntary case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nFor tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our hotels would be treated as a sale of the hotel for a purchase price equal to the\noutstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our\ntax basis in the hotel, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but we would not receive any cash proceeds, which could\nhinder Sotherly’s ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code. In addition, we have given full or partial\nguarantees to lenders of mortgage debt on behalf of the entities that own our hotels. When we give a guarantee on behalf of an entity\nthat owns one of our hotels, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity.\nOur borrowing costs are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.\nHigher interest rates could increase our debt service requirements and interest expense. Currently, our floating rate debt is\nlimited to the mortgages on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and The Whitehall, in Houston, Texas. The mortgage on\nthe DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport bears interest at a rate tied to SOFR. The mortgage on The Whitehall, in Houston,\nTexas bears interest at a rate tied to the New York Prime Rate. Each mortgage provides for a substitute rate and minimum rates of\ninterest. To the extent that increases in SOFR or New York Prime Rate, or a substitute rate of interest cause the interest on the\nmortgages to exceed the minimum rates of interest, we are exposed to rising interest rates.\nShould we obtain new debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness, we may increase the amount of floating rate debt that\ncurrently exists. In addition, adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nOur ability to effect a merger or other business combination transaction may be restricted by our Operating Partnership\nagreement.\nIn the event of a change of control of the Company, the limited partners of our Operating Partnership will have the right, for a\nperiod of 30 days following the change of control event, to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem all of the units held by the\nlimited partners for a cash amount equal to the cash redemption amount otherwise payable upon redemption pursuant to the\npartnership agreement. This cash redemption right may make it more unlikely or difficult for a third party to propose or consummate a\nchange of control transaction, even if such transaction were in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders.\n25\nProvisions of the Company’s charter may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of the Company.\nAggregate Share and Common Share Ownership Limits\nThe Company’s charter provides that no person may directly or indirectly own more than 9.9% of the value of the Company’s\noutstanding shares of capital stock or more than 9.9% of the number of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. These\nownership limitations may prevent an acquisition of control of the Company by a third party without the Company’s board of\ndirectors’ approval, even if the Company’s stockholders believe the change of control is in their best interest. The Company’s board of\ndirectors has discretion to waive that ownership limit if, including other considerations, the board receives evidence that ownership in\nexcess of the limit will not jeopardize the Company’s REIT status.\nAuthority to Issue Stock\nThe Company’s amended and restated charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 69,000,000 shares of common\nstock and up to 11,000,000 shares of preferred stock, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock\nand to set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Issuances of additional shares of stock may\nhave the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, including transactions at a premium over the market\nprice of the Company’s stock, even if stockholders believe that a change of control is in their best interest. The Company will be able\nto issue additional shares of common or preferred stock without stockholder approval, unless stockholder approval is required by\napplicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Company’s securities may be listed or\ntraded.\nProvisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of the Company.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (\"MGCL\") may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from\nmaking a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of\nshares of the Company’s common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such\nshares, including:\n• “business combination” provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an\n“interested stockholder” (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10.0% or more of the voting power of\nour shares or an affiliate thereof) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested\nstockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and special stockholder voting requirements on these\ncombinations; and\n• “control share” provisions that provide that “control shares” of the Company (defined as shares which, when aggregated\nwith other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting\npower in electing directors) acquired in a “control share acquisition” (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of\nownership or control of “control shares”) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the Company’s\nstockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all\ninterested shares.\nThe Company has opted out of these provisions of the MGCL, in the case of the business combination provisions of the MGCL\nby resolution of the Company’s board of directors, and in the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL pursuant to a provision\nin the Company’s bylaws. However, the Company’s board of directors may by resolution elect to opt into the business combination\nprovisions of the MGCL and the Company may, by amendment to its bylaws, opt into the control share provisions of the MGCL in the\nfuture. The Company’s board of directors has the exclusive power to amend the Company’s bylaws.\nAdditionally, Title 8, Subtitle 3 of the MGCL permits the Company’s board of directors, without stockholder approval and\nregardless of what is currently provided in the Company’s charter or bylaws, to implement takeover defenses, some of which (for\nexample, a classified board) the Company does not currently have. These provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party\nfrom making an acquisition proposal for the Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company\nunder the circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of the Company’s common stock with the opportunity to realize a\npremium over the then current market price.\nProvisions in the Company’s executive employment agreements may make a change of control of the Company more costly or\ndifficult.\nThe Company’s employment agreements with Andrew M. Sims, our Chairman, David R. Folsom, our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, Anthony E. Domalski, our Secretary and Chief Financial Officer, Scott M. Kucinski, our Executive Vice President\nand Chief Operating Officer, Robert E. Kirkland IV, our General Counsel, and Andrew M. Sims Jr., our Vice President - Operations &\nInvestor Relations, contain provisions providing for substantial payments to these officers in the event of a change of control of the\nCompany. Specifically, if the Company terminates these executives’ employment without cause or the executive resigns with good\nreason (which for Sims, Folsom, and Domalski, includes a failure to nominate Andrew M. Sims to the Company’s board of directors\n26\nor his involuntary removal from the Company’s board of directors, unless for cause or by vote of the stockholders), or if there is a\nchange of control, each of these executives is entitled to the following:\n• any accrued but unpaid salary and bonuses;\n• vesting of any previously issued stock options and restricted stock;\n• payment of the executive’s life, health and disability insurance coverage for a period of five years following termination;\n• any unreimbursed expenses; and\n• a severance payment equal to three times for each executive’s respective combined salary and actual bonus compensation\nfor the preceding fiscal year.\nIn the event that the Company elects not to renew Mr. Folsom’s employment agreement, then Mr. Folsom is entitled to receive\nthe following: (i) any accrued but unpaid salary and bonuses; (ii) a severance payment equal to Mr. Folsom’s combined salary and\nactual bonus compensation for the preceding fiscal year, to be paid within five (5) days of Mr. Folsom’s last day of employment; and\n(iii) payment of the full premium (including administrative fee) for continuing health insurance coverage under COBRA or any similar\nstate law for a period of two (2) years following the expiration of Mr. Folsom’s employment agreement.\nIn addition, these executives will receive additional payments to compensate them for the additional taxes, if any, imposed on\nthem under Section 4999 of the Code by reason of receipt of excess parachute payments. We will not be able to deduct any of the\nabove amounts paid to the executives for tax purposes.\nThese provisions may make a change of control of the Company, even if it is in the best interests of the Company’s\nstockholders, more costly and difficult and may reduce the amounts the Company’s stockholders would receive in a change of control\ntransaction.\nOur ownership limitations may restrict or prevent you from engaging in certain transfers of the Company’s common stock or\npreferred stock.\nIn order to maintain the Company’s REIT qualification, it cannot be closely held (i.e., more than 50.0% in value of our\noutstanding stock cannot be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any taxable year). To\npreserve the Company’s REIT qualification, the Company’s charter contains a 9.9% aggregate share ownership limit and a 9.9%\ncommon share ownership limit. Generally, any shares of the Company’s stock owned by affiliated persons will be added together for\npurposes of the aggregate share ownership limit, and any shares of common stock owned by affiliated owners will be added together\nfor purposes of the common share ownership limit.\nIf anyone transfers shares in a way that would violate the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit,\nor prevent the Company from continuing to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws, those shares instead will be\ntransferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and will be either redeemed by us or sold to a person whose ownership\nof the shares will not violate the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit. If this transfer to a trust fails\nto prevent such a violation or fails to preserve the Company’s continued qualification as a REIT, then the Company will consider the\ninitial intended transfer to be null and void from the outset. The intended transferee of those shares will be deemed never to have\nowned the shares. Anyone who acquires shares in violation of the aggregate share ownership limit, the common share ownership limit\nor the other restrictions on transfer in the Company’s charter bears the risk of suffering a financial loss when the shares are redeemed\nor sold if the market price of the Company’s stock falls between the date of purchase and the date of redemption or sale.\nThe Company’s articles supplementary establishing and fixing the rights and preferences of each of our 8.0% Series B\nCumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), 7.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable\nPerpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), and 8.25% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock\n(the “Series D Preferred Stock”, and together with the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, the \"Preferred\nStock\"), provide that no person may directly or indirectly own more than 9.9% of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of\nSeries B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, or Series D Preferred Stock, respectively, excluding any outstanding shares of\nSeries B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, or Series D Preferred Stock not treated as outstanding for federal income tax\npurposes. The Company’s board of directors has discretion to waive that ownership limit if, including other considerations, the board\nreceives evidence that ownership in excess of the limit will not jeopardize the Company’s REIT status.\n27\nHolders of our outstanding preferred shares have dividend, liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders\nof our common shares.\nOur board of directors has the authority to designate and issue preferred shares with liquidation, dividend and other rights that\nare senior to those of our common shares. As of December 31, 2023, 1,464,100 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock were issued\nand outstanding, 1,346,110 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, and 1,163,100 shares of our Series D\nPreferred Stock were issued and outstanding. The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series B\nPreferred Stock is approximately $44.7 million, and annual dividends on our outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are\napproximately $2.9 million. The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock is\napproximately $40.9 million, and annual dividends on our outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are approximately $2.7\nmillion. The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock is approximately\n$35.7 million, and annual dividends on our outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock are approximately $2.4 million. Holders of\nour Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative dividends before any dividends may be declared or set aside on our common shares.\nUpon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment is made to holders of our common\nshares, holders of these preferred shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus any accrued and\nunpaid distributions. This will reduce the remaining amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common\nshares. In addition, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock voting together as\na separate class have the right to elect two additional directors to our board of directors whenever dividends on the preferred shares are\nin arrears in an aggregate amount equivalent to six or more quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive). As of December 31,\n2023, distributions on our Preferred Stock are in arrears for the last eleven quarterly payments. Therefore, the holders of our Preferred\nStock are entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors of the Company, at a special meeting or at the next\nannual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of the stockholders until full cumulative distributions for all\npast unpaid periods are paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set aside. No dividends may be paid\non our common stock until such time as the Preferred Stock distributions are made current.\nBecause our decision to issue securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot\npredict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future preferred offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future\nsecurities issuances reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interest.\nThe change of control conversion and redemption features of the Company’s preferred stock may make it more difficult for a party\nto take over our Company or discourage a party from taking over our Company.\nUpon a change of control (as defined in our charter), holders of our Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, as provided in\nour charter, we have provided or provide notice of our election to exercise our special optional redemption right before the relevant\ndate) to convert some or all of their shares of preferred stock into shares of our common stock (or equivalent value of alternative\nconsideration). Upon such a conversion, holders will be limited to a maximum number of shares equal to the share cap, subject to\nadjustments. If the common stock price is less than $3.015, subject to adjustment, holders will receive a maximum of 8.29187 shares\nof our common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the\nliquidation preference of the Series B Preferred Stock. If the common stock price is less than $2.94, subject to adjustment, holders\nwill receive a maximum of 8.50340 shares of our common stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock, which may result in a holder\nreceiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the Series C Preferred Stock. If the common stock price is less than\n$3.38, subject to adjustment, holders will receive a maximum of 7.39645 shares of our common stock per share of Series D Preferred\nStock, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the Series D Preferred Stock. In\naddition, those features of our Preferred Stock may have the effect of inhibiting or discouraging a third party from making an\nacquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances\nthat otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock and shares of our Preferred Stock with the opportunity to\nrealize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.\nOur organizational documents have no limitation on the amount of indebtedness we may incur. As a result, we may become highly\nleveraged in the future, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur business strategy contemplates the use of both secured and unsecured debt to finance long-term growth. In addition, our\norganizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of debt that we may incur, and the Company’s board of directors may\nchange our financing policy at any time. As a result, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, in the\nfuture. Incurring debt could subject us to many risks, including the risks that:\n• our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest;\n• our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n28\n• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby\nreducing cash available for funds available for operations and capital expenditures, future business opportunities or other\npurposes; and\n• the terms of any refinancing may not be in the same amount or on terms as favorable as the terms of the existing debt\nbeing refinanced.\nThe board of directors’ revocation of the Company’s REIT status without stockholder approval may decrease the Company’s\nstockholders’ total return.\nThe Company’s charter provides that the Company’s board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate the Company’s\nREIT election, without the approval of the Company’s stockholders, if the Company’s board of directors determines that it is no\nlonger in the Company’s best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If the Company ceases to be a REIT, it would become subject\nto federal income tax on its taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of its taxable income to the Company’s\nstockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to the Company’s stockholders.\nThe ability of the Company’s board of directors to change the Company’s major corporate policies may not be in your best interest.\nThe Company’s board of directors determines the Company’s major corporate policies, including its acquisition, financing,\ngrowth, operations and distribution policies. The Company’s board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies from\ntime to time without the vote or consent of the Company’s stockholders.\nOur success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.\nWe depend on the efforts and expertise of our Chairman, Andrew M. Sims; our President and Chief Executive Officer, David R.\nFolsom; our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Scott M. Kucinski; and our Secretary and Chief Financial Officer,\nAnthony E. Domalski, to manage our day-to-day operations and strategic business direction. The loss of any of their services could\nhave an adverse effect on our operations.\nRisks Related to Conflicts of Interest of Our Officers and Directors\nConflicts of interest could result in our executive officers and certain of our directors acting in a manner other than in the\nCompany’s stockholders’ best interest.\nConflicts of interest relating to Our Town, the entity that manages our ten wholly-owned hotels and our two condominium hotel\nrental programs, and the terms of our management agreements with Our Town may lead to management decisions that are not\nin the stockholders’ best interest.\nConflicts of interest relating to Our Town may lead to management decisions that are not in the stockholders’ best interest. An\naffiliate of Andrew M. Sims, our Chairman, an affiliate of David R. Folsom, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andrew\nM. Sims Jr., our Vice President - Operations & Investor Relations, together own an interest of approximately 93.0%, as of March 15,\n2023, in Our Town. Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr. Sims Jr. serve as directors of Our Town.\nOur management agreements with Our Town establish the terms of Our Town’s management of our hotels covered by those\nagreements. The OTH Master Agreement provides that in the event the agreement is terminated in connection with the sale of a hotel,\nand Our Town accepts an offer to manage another hotel which is reasonably comparable to the hotel that was sold, we will not be\nliable for any termination fee. If we do not offer Our Town such opportunity or Our Town declines such opportunity, then a\ntermination fee equivalent to the lesser of the management fees paid for the prior twelve-month period or the management fees for the\nperiod prior to the sale that is equal to the number of months remaining under the term of the agreement will be due. If we terminate a\nhotel management agreement at the end of any renewable five-year term, Our Town is due a termination fee equivalent to one month’s\nmanagement fees, as determined under the agreement.\nAs owners of Our Town, which would receive any management and management termination fees payable by us under the\nmanagement agreements, Mr. Sims or Mr. Folsom may influence our decisions to sell a hotel or acquire or develop a hotel when it is\nnot in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders to do so. In addition, Mr. Sims and Mr. Folsom will have conflicts of interest\nwith respect to decisions to enforce provisions of the management agreements, including any termination thereof.\nMr. Sims and Mr. Folsom approve the budgets upon which the incentive management fee payable to Our Town is based. As\nowners of Our Town, which would receive any incentive management fees payable by us under the management agreements, Mr.\n29\nSims or Mr. Folsom may influence the budget process, including the revenue and profitability targets set for each hotel. The incentive\nmanagement fees are based on each hotel exceeding budgeted profitability targets.\nWe purchase employee medical benefits through Our Town (or its affiliate) for those employees employed by Our Town who\nwork exclusively for our properties. Mr. Sims and Mr. Folsom participate in the budget approval process confirming employee\ninsurance rates paid to Our Town. For the years ended 2022 and 2023, we received a rebate from Our Town equal to 70% of the\nannual surplus for the respective year.\nThere can be no assurance that provisions in our bylaws will always be successful in mitigating conflicts of interest.\nUnder our bylaws, a committee consisting of only independent directors must approve any transaction between us and Our\nTown, or any interested director. However, there can be no assurance that these policies always will be successful in mitigating such\nconflicts, and decisions could be made that might not fully reflect the interests of all of the Company’s stockholders.\nFederal Income Tax Risks Related to the Company’s Status as a REIT\nThe federal income tax laws governing REITs are complex.\nThe Company intends to operate in a manner that will maintain its qualification as a REIT under the federal income tax laws.\nThe REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex, however, and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing\nqualification as a REIT are limited. The Company has not requested or obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\")\nthat it qualifies as a REIT. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that the Company will be successful in operating in a manner that will\npermit it to qualify as a REIT. At any time, new laws, interpretations or court decisions may change the federal tax laws or the federal\nincome tax consequences of the Company’s qualification as a REIT. We cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law,\nregulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law, regulation or administrative\ninterpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect\nretroactively. The Company and its stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, federal income tax\nlaw, regulation or administrative interpretation. We are not aware, however, of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect\nthe Company’s ability to qualify as a REIT.\nFailure to make distributions could subject the Company to tax.\nIn order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, each year the Company must pay out to its stockholders in distributions, as\n“qualifying distributions,” at least 90.0% of its REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the deductions for dividends paid\nand excluding net capital gains and reduced by certain noncash items. To the extent that the Company satisfies this distribution\nrequirement, but distributes less than 100.0% of its taxable income (including its net capital gain), it will be subject to federal\ncorporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, the Company will be subject to a 4.0% nondeductible excise tax\nif the actual amount that it pays out to its stockholders as a “qualifying distribution” for a calendar year is less than the sum of: (A)\n85.0% of our ordinary income for such calendar year, plus (B) 95.0% of our capital gain net income for such calendar year. The\nCompany’s only recurring source of funds to make these distributions comes from rent received from its TRS Lessees whose only\nrecurring source of funds with which to make these payments and distributions is the net cash flow (after payment of operating and\nother costs and expenses and management fees) from hotel operations, and any dividend and other distributions that we may receive\nfrom MHI Holding. Accordingly, the Company may be required to borrow money or sell assets to make distributions sufficient to\nenable it to pay out enough of its taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the\n4.0% nondeductible excise tax in a particular year.\nFailure to qualify as a REIT would subject the Company to federal income tax.\nIf the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be required to pay federal income tax on its taxable income\nat regular corporate rates. The resulting tax liability might cause the Company to borrow funds, liquidate some of its investments or\ntake other steps that could negatively affect its operating results in order to pay any such tax. Unless it is entitled to relief under certain\nstatutory provisions, the Company would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in\nwhich it lost its qualification. If the Company lost its REIT status, its net earnings available for investment or distribution to\nstockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, the Company would no longer be required to\nmake distributions to its stockholders, and it would not be able to deduct any stockholder distributions in computing its taxable\nincome. This would substantially reduce the Company’s earnings, cash available to pay distributions, and the value of common stock.\n30\nFailure to qualify as a REIT may cause the Company to reduce or eliminate distributions to its stockholders, and the Company\nmay face increased difficulty in raising capital or obtaining financing.\nIf the Company fails to remain qualified as a REIT, it may have to reduce or eliminate any distributions to its stockholders in\norder to satisfy its income tax liabilities. Any distributions that the Company does make to its stockholders would be treated as taxable\ndividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. This may result in negative investor and market perception\nregarding the market value of the Company’s stock, and the value of its stock may be reduced. In addition, the Company and the\nOperating Partnership may face increased difficulty in raising capital or obtaining financing if the Company fails to qualify or remain\nqualified as a REIT because of the resulting tax liability and potential reduction of its market valuation.\nIf MHI Holding exceeds certain value thresholds, this could cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT.\nA REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be\nqualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT. Overall, no more than 20.0% of the value of a REIT’s assets may\nconsist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. MHI Holding is a TRS and the Company may form other TRSs in the future. The\nCompany plans to monitor the value of its shares of MHI Holding and of any other TRS the Company may form. However, there can\nbe no assurance that the IRS will not attempt to attribute additional value to the shares of MHI Holding or to the shares of any other\nTRS that the Company may form. If the Company is treated as owning securities of one or more TRSs with an aggregate value that is\nin excess of the thresholds outlined above, the Company could lose its status as a REIT or become subject to penalties.\nThe Company’s transactions with MHI Holding may cause it to be subject to a 100% excise tax on certain income or deductions if\nsuch transactions are not conducted on arm’s-length terms.\nRent paid to the Company by the TRS Lessees cannot be based on net income or profits for such rents to qualify as “rents from\nreal property.” We receive some percentage rent from the TRS Lessees that is calculated based on the gross revenues—not based on\nnet income or profits. If the IRS determines that the rent paid pursuant to our leases with the TRS Lessees are excessive, the\ndeductibility thereof by the TRS Lessees may be challenged, and we could be subject to a 100% excise tax on “re-determined rent” or\n“re-determined deductions” to the extent that such rent exceeds an arm’s-length amount. We believe that our rent and other\ntransactions with the TRS Lessees are based on arm’s-length amounts and reflect normal business practices, but there can be no\nassurance that the IRS will agree with our belief.\nEven if the Company remains qualified as a REIT, it may face other tax liabilities that reduce its cash flow.\nEven if the Company remains qualified for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on its\nincome and assets. For example:\n• it will be required to pay tax on undistributed REIT taxable income (including net capital gain);\n• if it has net income from the disposition of foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course\nof business or other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, it must pay tax on that income at the highest\ncorporate rate;\n• if it (or the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary of the Operating Partnership other than MHI Holding) sells a property\nin a “prohibited transaction,” its gain, or its share of such gain, from the sale would be subject to a 100.0% penalty tax. A\n“prohibited transaction” would be a sale of property, other than a foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to\ncustomers in the ordinary course of business;\n• it may, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in\norder to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain its qualification as a REIT;\n• MHI Holding is a fully taxable corporation and is required to pay federal and state taxes on its taxable income; and\n• it may experience increases in its state and/or local income tax burdens as states and localities continue to look to modify\ntheir tax laws in order to raise revenues, including by (among other things) changing from a net taxable income-based\nregime to a gross receipts-based regime, suspending and/or limiting the use of net operating losses (\"NOL\"), increasing\ntax rates and fees, imposing surcharges and subjecting partnerships to an entity-level tax, and limiting or disallowing\ncertain U.S. federal deductions such as the dividends-paid deduction.\n31\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause the Company to forgo attractive opportunities that could otherwise generate strong\nrisk-adjusted returns and instead pursue less attractive opportunities, or none at all.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other\nthings, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts it distributes to its stockholders and the\nownership of its stock.\nIn general, when applying these tests, the Company is treated as owning its proportionate share of the Operating Partnership’s\nassets (which share is determined in accordance with the Company’s capital interest in the Operating Partnership) and as being\nentitled to the Operating Partnership’s income attributable to such share. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder\nour ability to operate solely on the basis of generating strong risk-adjusted returns on invested capital for our stockholders.\nComplying with REIT requirements may force the Company to liquidate otherwise attractive investments, which could result in an\noverall loss on its investments.\nTo maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75.0% of the\nvalue of its assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of the\nCompany’s assets (other than securities of one or more TRSs) generally cannot include more than 10.0% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of any one issuer or more than 10.0% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in\ngeneral, no more than 5.0% of the value of the Company’s assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and\nsecurities of one or more TRSs) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20.0% of the value of the Company’s\ntotal assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs.\nWhen applying these asset tests, the Company is treated as owning its proportionate share of the Operating Partnership’s assets\n(which is determined in accordance with the Company’s capital interest in the Operating Partnership). If the Company fails to comply\nwith these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, it must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar\nquarter to avoid losing its REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. If the Company fails to comply with these\nrequirements at the end of any calendar quarter, and the failure exceeds a de-minimis threshold, the Company may be able to preserve\nits REIT status if the failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. In this case, we will be required to dispose of the\nassets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure occurred, and we will be required to\npay an additional tax of the greater of $50,000 or the product of the highest applicable tax rate multiplied by the net income generated\non those assets.\nAs a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the Company could cease to qualify\nas a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership will continue to qualify to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners,\nincluding the Company, will be required to pay tax on its allocable share of the Operating Partnership’s income. We cannot assure\nyou, however, that the IRS will not challenge the Operating Partnership’s status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\nor that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership as a corporation for\nfederal income tax purposes, the Company could fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs\nand, accordingly, cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of the Operating Partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause the\nOperating Partnership to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of\ncash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including the Company.\nThe Company’s failure to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences to its stockholders.\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with its taxable year\nended December 31, 2004. The Company believes it has operated so as to qualify as a REIT under the Code and believes that its\ncurrent organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Code to enable the\nCompany to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is possible that the Company has been organized or has operated in a manner\nthat would not allow it to qualify as a REIT, or that its future operations could cause it to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT\nrequires the Company to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly\ntechnical and complex sections of the Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves\nthe determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within its control. For example, in order to qualify as a\nREIT, the Company must satisfy a 75.0% gross income test pursuant to Code Section 856(c)(3) and a 95.0% gross income test\npursuant to Code Section 856(c)(2) each taxable year. In addition, the Company must pay dividends, as “qualifying distributions,” to\n32\nits stockholders aggregating annually at least 90.0% of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid\ndeduction and by excluding capital gains and also reduced by certain noncash items) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a\nquarterly basis. While historically the Company has satisfied the distribution requirement discussed above, by making cash\ndistributions to its stockholders, the Company may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other\nproperty, including, in limited circumstances, its stock. The provisions of the Code and applicable Treasury regulations regarding\nqualification as a REIT are more complicated in the Company’s case because it holds its assets through the Operating Partnership.\nIf MHI Holding does not qualify as a TRS, or if the Company’s hotel manager does not qualify as an “eligible independent\ncontractor,” the Company would fail to qualify as a REIT and would be subject to higher taxes and have less cash available for\ndistribution to its stockholders.\nRent paid by a lessee that is a “related party tenant” of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income\ntests applicable to REITs, as noted above. The Company currently leases substantially all of its hotels to the TRS Lessees, which are\ndisregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are wholly-owned by MHI Holding, a TRS, and expects to continue to\ndo so. So long as MHI Holding qualifies as a TRS, it will not be treated as a “related party tenant” with respect to the Company’s\nproperties that are managed by an independent hotel management company that qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor.” The\nCompany believes that MHI Holding will continue to qualify to be treated as a TRS for federal income tax purposes, but there can be\nno assurance that the IRS will not challenge this status or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in\nsuch challenge, it is possible that the Company would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to REITs and substantially all of its income\nwould fail to be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests. If the Company failed to meet any of the asset or gross\nincome tests, it would likely lose its REIT qualification for federal income tax purposes.\nAdditionally, if the Company’s hotel manager does not qualify as an “eligible independent contractor,” the Company would fail\nto qualify as a REIT. Each hotel manager that enters into a management contract with the TRS Lessees must qualify as an “eligible\nindependent contractor” under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid by the TRS Lessees to be qualifying income for purposes of\nthe REIT gross income tests. Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, a hotel manager\nmust not own, directly or through its stockholders, more than 35.0% of the Company’s outstanding shares, taking into account certain\nownership attribution rules. The ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of these 35.0% thresholds are complex. Although\nthe Company intends to monitor ownership of its shares by its hotel manager and its owners, there can be no assurance that these\nownership levels will not be exceeded.\nIn addition, for the Company’s hotel management company to qualify as an “eligible independent contractor,” such company or\na related person must be actively engaged in the trade or business of operating “qualified lodging facilities” (as defined below) for one\nor more persons not related to the REIT or its TRSs at each time that such company enters into a hotel management contract with a\nTRS. The Company believes the hotel manager operates qualified lodging facilities for certain persons who are not related to the REIT\nor its TRSs. However, no assurances can be provided that this will continue to be the case or that any other hotel management\ncompanies that the Company may engage in the future will in fact comply with this requirement in the future. Failure to comply with\nthis requirement would require the Company to find other managers for future contracts, and, if the Company hired a management\ncompany without knowledge of the failure, it could jeopardize the Company’s status as a REIT.\nAs noted above, each hotel with respect to which a TRS Lessee pays rent must be a “qualified lodging facility”. A “qualified\nlodging facility” is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient\nbasis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such\nfacility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who is legally authorized to engage in such business at\nor in connection with such facility. The Company believes that all of the hotels leased to the TRS Lessees are qualified lodging\nfacilities. Although the Company intends to monitor future acquisitions and improvements of hotels, the REIT provisions of the Code\nprovide only limited guidance for making determinations under the requirements for qualified lodging facilities, and there can be no\nassurance that these requirements will be satisfied in all cases.\nForeign investors may be subject to U.S. tax on the disposition of the Company’s stock if the Company does not qualify as a\n“domestically controlled” REIT.\nA foreign person disposing of a “U.S. real property interest,” which includes stock of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist\nprincipally of U.S. real property interests, is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax under the Foreign Investment in Real\nProperty Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) on the gain recognized on the disposition, unless such foreign person is a “qualified foreign\npension fund” or one of the certain publicly traded non-U.S. “qualified collective investment vehicles”. Additionally, the transferee\nwill be required to withhold 15.0% on the amount realized on the disposition if the foreign transferor is subject to U.S. federal income\ntax under FIRPTA. This 15.0% is creditable against the U.S. federal income tax liability of the foreign transferor in connection with\nsuch transferor’s disposition of the Company’s stock. FIRPTA does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the\nREIT is “domestically controlled” (i.e., less than 50.0% of the REIT’s capital stock, by value, has been owned directly or indirectly by\n33\npersons who are not qualifying U.S. persons during a continuous five-year period ending on the date of disposition or, if shorter,\nduring the entire period of the REIT’s existence). On December 29, 2022, the IRS released proposed regulations under FIRPTA that,\nif finalized as proposed, include a new “look-through rule” in determining whether a REIT is considered to be “domestically\ncontrolled.” In determining ownership, the look-through rule would require a REIT to “look-through” any nonpublic domestic\ncorporation if 25% or more of the corporation’s stock (by value) is owned by foreign persons. We cannot be sure that the Company\nwill qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT. If the Company does not so qualify, gain realized by foreign investors on a sale of\nthe Company’s stock would be subject to U.S. income and withholding tax under FIRPTA, unless the Company’s stock were traded\non an established securities market and a foreign investor did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly\nown more than 10.0% of the value of the Company’s outstanding stock.\nIf the leases between the Operating Partnership and the TRS Lessees are recharacterized, the Company may fail to qualify as a\nREIT.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company must satisfy two gross income tests, under which specified\npercentages of the Company’s gross income must be derived from certain sources, including “rents from real property”. Rents paid by\nthe TRS Lessees to the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries pursuant to the leases of the Company’s hotel properties will\nconstitute substantially all of the Company’s gross income. In order for such rent to qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes\nof the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service\ncontracts, joint ventures, or some other type of arrangement. If the leases between the TRS Lessees to the Operating Partnership and\nits subsidiaries are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes, the Company could fail to qualify as a REIT for\nfederal income tax purposes.\nMHI Holding increases our overall tax liability.\nOur TRS Lessees are single-member limited liability companies that are wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by MHI Holding,\na TRS that is wholly-owned by the Operating Partnership. Each of our TRS Lessees is disregarded as an entity separate from MHI\nHolding for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such that the assets, liabilities, income, gains, losses, credits and deductions of our TRS\nLessees are treated as the assets, liabilities, income, gains, losses, credits and deductions of MHI Holding for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. MHI Holding is subject to federal and state income tax on its taxable income, which will consist of the revenues from the\nhotels leased by the Company’s TRS Lessees, net of the operating expenses for such hotels and rent payments. Accordingly, although\nthe Company’s ownership of MHI Holding and the TRS Lessees will allow it to participate in the operating income from its hotels in\naddition to receiving rent, that operating income will be fully subject to income tax. The after-tax net income of MHI Holding, if any,\nwill be available for distribution to the Company via the Operating Partnership.\nThe Company will incur a 100.0% excise tax on its transactions with MHI Holding and the TRS Lessees that are not conducted\non an arm’s-length basis. For example, to the extent that the rent paid by the TRS Lessees exceeds an arm’s-length rental amount,\nsuch amount potentially will be subject to this excise tax. The Company intends that all transactions among itself, MHI Holding and\nthe TRS Lessees will be conducted on an arm’s-length basis and, therefore, that the rent paid by the TRS Lessees will not be subject to\nthis excise tax. While the Company believes its leases have customary terms and reflect normal business practices and that the rents\npaid thereto reflect market terms, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree.\nTaxation of dividend income could make the Company’s stock less attractive to certain investors and reduce the market price of its\nstock.\nThe federal income tax laws governing REITs, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended at any time.\nAny new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect the Company or could adversely affect its\nstockholders. Currently, “qualified dividends,” which include dividends from domestic C corporations that are paid to non-corporate\nstockholders, are subject to a reduced maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20.0%, plus a 3.8% \"Medicare tax\" discussed below.\nBecause REITs generally do not pay corporate-level taxes as a result of the dividends-paid deduction to which they are entitled,\ndividends from REITs generally are not treated as qualified dividends and thus do not qualify for a reduced tax rate. Under the Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), for taxable years prior to January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer may deduct 20% of ordinary REIT\ndividends that are not “capital gain dividends” or “qualified dividend income” resulting in an effective maximum U.S. federal income\ntax rate of 29.6% (based on the current maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for individuals of 37%). Individuals, trusts and estates\nwhose income exceeds certain thresholds are also subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax on dividends received from the Company. The more\nfavorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive\ninvestments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends,\nwhich could adversely affect the value of the Company’s stock. Moreover, there is no assurance that we will always distribute\nordinary income dividends, or that Congress will not repeal such legislation.\n34\nInvestors may be subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax in connection with an investment in the Company’s stock.\nThe U.S. tax laws impose a 3.8% Medicare tax on the “net investment income” (i.e., interest, dividends, capital gains, annuities,\nand rents that are not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business) of individuals with income exceeding $200,000 ($250,000\nif married filing jointly or $125,000 if married filing separately), and of estates and trusts. Dividends on the Company’s stock as well\nas gains from the disposition of the Company’s stock may be subject to the Medicare tax. Prospective investors should consult with\ntheir independent advisors as to the applicability of the Medicare tax to an investment in the Company’s stock in light of such\ninvestors’ particular circumstances.\nInvestors may be subject to U.S. withholding tax under the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.”\nOn March 18, 2010, the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (the “HIRE Act”) was enacted in the United States. The\nHIRE Act includes provisions known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (\"FATCA\"), that generally impose a 30.0% U.S.\nwithholding tax on “withholdable payments,” which consist of (i) U.S.-source dividends, interest, rents and other “fixed or\ndeterminable annual or periodical income” paid after June 30, 2014 and (ii) certain U.S.-source gross proceeds paid after December\n31, 2018 to (a) “foreign financial institutions” unless (x) they enter into an agreement with the IRS to collect and disclose to the IRS\ninformation regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners or (y) they comply with the terms of any FATCA intergovernmental\nagreement executed between the authorities in their jurisdiction and the U.S., and (b) “non-financial foreign entities” (i.e., foreign\nentities that are not foreign financial institutions) unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S.\nowners. Final regulations under FATCA were issued by the IRS on January 17, 2013 and have been subsequently supplemented by\nadditional regulations and guidance. FATCA does not replace the existing U.S. withholding tax regime. However, the FATCA\nregulations contain coordination provisions to avoid double withholding on U.S.-source income.\nA foreign investor that receives dividends on the Company’s stock or gross proceeds from a disposition of shares of the\nCompany’s stock may be subject to FATCA withholding tax with respect to such dividends or gross proceeds.\nForeign investors will be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the receipt of ordinary dividends on the Company’s stock.\nThe portion of dividends received by a foreign investor payable out of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits which are not attributable to capital gains and which are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the foreign\ninvestor will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a statutory rate of 30.0%. This 30.0% withholding tax may be reduced by\nan applicable income tax treaty. The FATCA and nonresident withholding regulations are complex. Even if the 30.0% withholding is\nreduced or eliminated by treaty for payments made to a foreign investor, FATCA withholding of 30.0% could apply depending upon\nthe foreign investor’s FATCA status. Foreign investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the U.S. withholding tax\nconsequences to such investors with respect to their investment in the Company’s stock in light of their particular circumstances, as\nwell as determining the appropriate documentation required to reduce or eliminate U.S. withholding tax.\nForeign investors will be subject to U.S. income tax on the receipt of capital gain dividends on the Company’s stock.\nUnder FIRPTA, distributions that we make to a foreign investor that are attributable to gains from our dispositions of U.S. real\nproperty interests (“capital gain dividends”) will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and\ntherefore subject to U.S. federal income tax, in the hands of the foreign investor, unless such foreign person is a “qualified foreign\npension fund” or one of certain publicly traded non-U.S. “qualified collective investment vehicles”. A foreign investor who is subject\nto tax under FIRPTA will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (at the rates applicable to U.S. investors) on any capital gain dividends\nand will also be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns to report such capital gain dividends. Furthermore, capital gain\ndividends are subject to an additional 30.0% “branch profits tax” (which may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty) in the\nhands of a foreign investor who is subject to tax under FIRPTA if such foreign investor is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nU.S. tax reform and related regulatory action could adversely affect you and the Company.\nBecause our operations are governed to a significant extent by the federal tax laws, new legislative or regulatory action could\nadversely affect investors in Company stock. The TCJA and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”)\nmade significant changes to the U.S. federal tax system. Specifically, and as relevant to the Company and its subsidiaries, the TCJA\nreduced the maximum corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, allows for full expensing of certain property, revised the NOL provisions,\nset limitations on certain types of interest deductions, and expanded limitations on deductions for executive compensation. The TCJA\nalso temporarily reduced individual federal income tax rates on ordinary income (the highest individual federal income tax rate has\nbeen reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026).\nThe IRS, the U.S. Treasury Department and Congress frequently review U.S. federal income tax legislation, regulations and\nother guidance. At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws\n35\nmay be amended or modified. Changes to the tax laws, possibly with retroactive application, may adversely affect taxation of the\nCompany or the Company's stockholders. The Company urges stockholders and prospective stockholders to consult with their tax\nadvisors with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on\nan investment in the Company's shares. We cannot predict whether any of these proposed changes will become law, or the long-term\neffect of any future law changes on the Company and its stockholders. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any\nsuch change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nOur Chief Financial Officer is responsible for managing cybersecurity risk. With the assistance of outside consultants, he\ndevelops mitigation strategies and implements controls to reduce the likelihood of a cybersecurity incident occurring as well as to\nreduce the impact of any such incident, should it occur. At least annually, he discusses cybersecurity risk and the Company’s\nmitigation efforts and effectiveness of controls with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is the committee that has\nprimary responsibility for overseeing our risk assessment and is composed solely of independent directors. The Audit Committee\nreviews and discusses our cybersecurity risk and reviews the tests of controls performed by consultants that perform the internal audit\nfunction. The chair of the Audit Committee may, at his discretion, report to the Chairman of the Board or the full Board of Directors.\nAs of December 31, 2023, no risk from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incident, has\nmaterially affected our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we have implemented controls to protect our\ndata and information systems and monitor our systems on an ongoing basis, such efforts may not prevent material compromises to our\ninformation systems in the future, including those that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We maintain\ncybersecurity insurance coverage to mitigate our financial exposure to certain incidents, and we consult with external advisors\nregarding opportunities and enhancements to strengthen our policies and procedures.\nWhile we have control over our information systems, we do not have control over the information systems of our hotel manager,\nOur Town, or of our franchisors. Although we set expectations for Our Town and our franchisors, we rely on them to manage the\ncybersecurity risk to which they are subject. Our hotel manager maintains separate cybersecurity insurance coverage to offset a\nportion of potential costs incurred from a security breach.\nWe currently do not have a cybersecurity incident response plan with respect to our data and information systems. We rely on\nOur Town and their cybersecurity consultants as well as our franchisors, to maintain cybersecurity incident response plans applicable\nto their systems and hotel-level systems they manage on our behalf.\nFor additional information about cybersecurity risk, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We and our manager rely on information\ntechnology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our\nbusiness.”\n36\nItem 2.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nSotherly Hotels Inc.\nMarket Information\nThe Company’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ ® Global Market under the symbol “SOHO”. The closing price of the\nCompany’s common stock on the NASDAQ ® Global Market on March 1, 2024 was $1.37 per share.\nStockholder Information\nAs of March 1, 2024, there were approximately 85 holders of record of the Company’s common stock. Because many of the\nCompany's common shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, the Company believe there are\nsubstantially more beneficial holders of its common shares than record holders.\nIn order to comply with certain requirements related to the Company’s qualification as a REIT, the Company’s charter, subject\nto certain exceptions, limits the number of common shares that may be owned by any single person or affiliated group to 9.9% of the\noutstanding common shares.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nOn April 28, 2023, a holder of units in the Operating Partnership redeemed 75,000 units for an equivalent number of shares of\nthe Company's common stock. The shares of common stock were issued to the unitholder pursuant to an exemption from registration\nunder Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nOn August 18, 2023, a holder of units in the Operating Partnership redeemed 252,903 units for an equivalent number of shares\nof the Company's common stock. The shares of common stock were issued to the unitholder pursuant to an exemption from\nregistration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nOn August 30, 2023, a holder of units in the Operating Partnership redeemed 133,099 units for an equivalent number of shares\nof the Company's common stock. The shares of common stock were issued to the unitholder pursuant to an exemption from\nregistration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nSotherly Hotels LP\nMarket Information\nThere is no established trading market for partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership does not\ncurrently propose to offer partnership units to the public and does not currently expect that a public market for those units will\ndevelop.\nPartnership Unitholder Information\nAs of March 1, 2024, there were 5 holders of the Operating Partnership’s partnership units, including Sotherly Hotels Inc.,\nwhich owned approximately 98.2% of the outstanding general and limited partnership units as well as 100% of the preferred\npartnership units.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nFrom time to time, the Operating Partnership may issue and/or repurchase limited partnership units (common and/or preferred)\nto the Company, as required by the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, to mirror\nthe capital structure of the Company to reflect additional issuances by the Company and to preserve equitable ownership ratios.\nThere were no sales of unregistered securities in the Operating Partnership during 2023.\n38\nSotherly Hotels Inc. and Sotherly Hotels LP\nDividend and Distribution Information\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2004. To maintain\nqualification as a REIT, we are required to make annual distributions to the Company’s stockholders of at least 90.0% of our REIT\ntaxable income, excluding net capital gain, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. Our ability to pay distributions to the Company’s stockholders will depend, in part, upon our receipt of\ndistributions from our Operating Partnership which may depend upon receipt of lease payments with respect to our properties from\nour TRS Lessees, and in turn, upon the management of our properties by our hotel manager. Distributions to the Company’s\nstockholders will generally be taxable to the Company’s stockholders as ordinary income; however, because a portion of our\ninvestments are equity ownership interests in hotels, which will result in depreciation and noncash charges against our income, a\nportion of our distributions may constitute a tax-free return of capital. To the extent not inconsistent with maintaining our REIT status,\nour TRS Lessees may retain any after-tax earnings.\nAs a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, our board of directors has suspended our common stock dividend. We\nanticipate that our board of directors will re-evaluate our current dividend policy on an ongoing basis. Distributions on our preferred\nstock are in arrears for the last eleven quarterly payments. On January 24, 2023, the Company resumed quarterly distributions to\nholders of its preferred stock. No dividends may be paid on our common stock until such time as the preferred stock distributions are\nmade current. We did not pay any common dividends in 2022 or 2023.\nIn order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to\nat least:\n• 90% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital\ngains; plus\n• 90% of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the Code; minus\n• Any excess noncash income (as defined in the Code).\n39\nThe Company did not pay any common stock dividends in 2022 or 2023. The Company did not pay any preferred stock\ndividends in 2022. The following tables set forth information regarding the declaration, payment and income tax characterization of\ndistributions by the Company on its preferred shares to the Company’s preferred stockholders for fiscal year 2023.

[Reserved]\n40\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company is a self-managed and self-administered lodging REIT incorporated in Maryland in August 2004 to pursue\nopportunities in the full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale segments of the hotel industry located in primary and secondary\nmarkets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. Since January 1, 2021, we have completed the following acquisitions and\ndispositions:\n• On February 10, 2022, we sold the Sheraton Louisville Riverside hotel located in Jeffersonville, Indiana.\n• On June 10, 2022, we sold the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh-Brownstone University hotel located in Raleigh, North\nCarolina\nAs of December 31, 2023, our hotel portfolio consisted of ten full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels with an\naggregate total of 2,786 rooms, as well as interests in two condominium hotels and their associated rental programs. Seven of our\nhotels operate under well-known brands such as DoubleTree by Hilton, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, and Hyatt Centric, and three\nare independent hotels. As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio consisted of the following hotel properties:\nNumber\nProperty of Rooms Location Date of Acquisition Chain/Class Designation\nWholly-owned Hotels\nThe DeSoto 246 Savannah, GA December 21, 2004 Upper Upscale(1)\nDoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront 293 Jacksonville, FL July 22, 2005 Upscale\nDoubleTree by Hilton Laurel 208 Laurel, MD December 21, 2004 Upscale\nDoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport 331 Philadelphia, PA December 21, 2004 Upscale\nDoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach 311 Hollywood, FL August 9, 2007 Upscale\nGeorgian Terrace 326 Atlanta, GA March 27, 2014 Upper Upscale(1)\nHotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton 222 Tampa, FL October 29, 2007 Upscale\nHotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection by\nHilton 272 Wilmington, NC December 21, 2004 Upscale\nHyatt Centric Arlington 318 Arlington, VA March 1, 2018 Upper Upscale\nThe Whitehall 259 Houston, TX November 13, 2013 Upper Upscale(1)\nHotel Rooms Subtotal 2,786\nCondominium Hotels\nHyde Resort & Residences 65 (2) Hollywood, FL January 30, 2017 Luxury(1)\nHyde Beach House Resort & Residences 75 (2) Hollywood, FL September 27, 2019 Luxury(1)\nTotal Hotel & Participating Condominium Hotel Rooms 2,926\n(1) Operated as an independent hotel.\n(2) We own the hotel commercial unit and operate a rental program. Reflects only those condominium units that were participating\nin the rental program as of December 31, 2023. At any given time, some portion of the units participating in our rental program\nmay be occupied by the unit owner(s) and unavailable for rental to hotel guests. We sometimes refer to each participating\ncondominium unit as a “room.”\nWe conduct substantially all our business through the Operating Partnership, Sotherly Hotels LP. The Company is the sole\ngeneral partner of the Operating Partnership and currently owns an approximate 98.2% interest in the Operating Partnership, with the\nremaining interest being held by limited partners who were contributors of our initial hotel properties and related assets.\nTo qualify as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership can operate our hotels. Therefore, our wholly-owned\nhotel properties are leased to our TRS Lessees that are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, which then engage\nhotel management companies to operate the hotels under a management agreement. Our TRS Lessees have engaged Our Town to\nmanage our hotels. Our TRS Lessees, and their parent, MHI Holding (MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc.), are consolidated into each\nof our financial statements for accounting purposes. The earnings of MHI Holding are taxable as regular C corporations and are\nsubject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on its taxable income.\n41\nKey Operating Metrics\nIn the hotel industry, room revenue is considered the most important category of revenue and drives other revenue categories\nsuch as food, beverage, catering, parking and telephone. There are three key performance indicators used in the hotel industry to\nmeasure room revenues:\n• Occupancy, or the number of rooms sold, usually expressed as a percentage of total rooms available;\n• Average daily rate, or ADR, which is total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold; and\n• Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, which is total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms.\nRevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and\nprofitability than changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to\nadditional variable operating costs (such as housekeeping services, laundry, utilities, room supplies, franchise fees, management fees,\ncredit card commissions and reservations expense), but could also result in increased non-room revenue from the hotel’s restaurant,\nbanquet or parking facilities. Changes in RevPAR that are primarily driven by changes in ADR typically have a greater impact on\noperating margins and profitability as they do not generate all the additional variable operating costs associated with higher\noccupancy.\nWe also use Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), Adjusted FFO and Hotel EBITDA as measures of our operating performance. See\n“Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2023 to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nThe following table illustrates the key operating metrics for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 for our wholly-owned\nhotels and the condominium hotel units, during each respective reporting period (“composite portfolio” properties), as well as the key\noperating metrics for the ten wholly-owned hotel properties that were under our control during all of 2023 (“actual” properties).\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2022\nComposite Actual Composite Actual\nOccupancy % 62.8% 63.5% 60.0% 60.8%\nADR $ 182.97 $ 177.74 $ 181.34 $ 171.34\nRevPAR $ 114.96 $ 112.84 $ 108.87 $ 104.17\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $173.8 million, an increase of approximately\n$7.8 million, or 4.7%, from total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $166.0 million. There was an\naggregate increase in total revenue of approximately $13.5 million from eight of our properties, offset by a decrease of approximately\n$2.5 million, at four of our properties and a decrease of approximately $3.2 million as a result of the sales of the Sheraton Louisville\nRiverside in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in February 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University in Raleigh, North\nCarolina, in June 2022.\nRoom revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased approximately $5.1 million, or 4.7%, to\napproximately $114.7 million compared to room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $109.6 million\nEight of our properties experiencing increased room revenue offset by a decrease of approximately $2.3 million as a result of the sales\nof the Sheraton Louisville Riverside in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in February 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone\nUniversity in Raleigh, North Carolina, in June 2022.\nFood and beverage revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased approximately $5.7 million, or\n19.2%, to approximately $35.2 million compared to food and beverage revenues of approximately $29.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, with most of our properties experiencing increased demand for food and beverage services as a result of increased\noccupancy as well as an increase in meetings, banqueting and catering. The increase in food and beverage revenues for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, resulted from an aggregate increase of approximately $6.0 million from nine of our properties, offset by a\ndecrease in food and beverage revenue of approximately $0.2 million related to the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside, in\nFebruary 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University in June 2022.\nOther operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased approximately $3.1 million, or 11.5%, to\napproximately $23.9 million compared to other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $27.0\nmillion. The decrease was mostly related to a decrease of approximately $1.6 million in fees earned at our condominium unit rental\nprograms at the Hyde Resort & Residences and the Hyde Beach House. In addition, we received non-recurring proceeds of $1.0\n42\nmillion received under the North Carolina Business Recovery Grant as well as approximately $1.0 million in other reimbursed\nexpenses at the Georgian Terrace in Atlanta, Georgia in 2022. A further decrease in other operating revenues of approximately $0.2\nmillion related to the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside, in February 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone\nUniversity in June 2022.\nHotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct\nexpenses, indirect expenses, and management fees, increased approximately $9.4 million, or 7.9%, for the year ended December 31,\n2023 to approximately $129.0 million compared to hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately\n$119.6 million. The aggregate increase of approximately $12.9 million in hotel operating expenses for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023, is directly related to the increase in hotel occupancy and gross revenue at ten of our properties, which was\npartially offset by approximately $2.4 million, with the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside in February 2022 and the DoubleTree\nby Hilton Raleigh Brownstone University, in June 2022; and reductions in hotel operating expenses at two properties of approximately\n$1.1 million.\nRooms expense at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased approximately $0.4 million, or 1.5%, to\napproximately $26.2 million compared to rooms expense of approximately $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nincrease in rooms expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulted from an aggregate increase of approximately $1.6 million\nfrom eight of our properties, offset by a decrease of approximately $0.6 million as a result of the sale of our properties in\nJeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina and decreases at the other two properties by approximately $0.6 million.\nFood and beverage expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased approximately $4.5 million, or\n22.7%, to approximately $24.2 million compared to food and beverage expense of approximately $19.7 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The net increase in food and beverage expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, resulted from\nan aggregate increase of approximately $4.7 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $0.2 million as a result of the sale of our\nproperties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina.\nExpenses from other operating departments decreased approximately $0.3 million, or 2.8%, to approximately $9.0 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, compared to expenses from other operating departments of approximately $9.3 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in expenses from other operating departments for the twelve months ended December\n31, 2023, resulted from aggregate decreases at five of our properties and the properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North\nCarolina, had decreases in other operating expenses aggregating to approximately $0.6 million, which were offset by increases in\nother operating expenses of approximately $0.3 million from seven of our properties. These increases were seen mainly from bringing\nback parking servicing contractors.\nIndirect expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased approximately $4.8 million, or 7.4%, to\napproximately $69.6 million compared to indirect expenses of approximately $64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe increase in indirect expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, resulted from an aggregate increase in total\nindirect expenses of approximately $6.9 million from ten of our properties, offset by decreases of approximately $1.5 million as a\nresult of the sale of our properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina and two properties with a decrease of\napproximately $0.6 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by\napproximately $0.1 million or 0.7%, to approximately $18.8 million, compared to depreciation and amortization expense of\napproximately $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nCorporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023\nincreased approximately $0.5 million, or 6.9%, to approximately $7.1 million compared to corporate general and administrative\nexpenses of approximately $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in corporate general and administrative\nexpenses was mainly due to an increase in professional fees and compensation expenses offset by reductions in legal and other\nexpenses.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased approximately $2.2 million, or 11.0%, to\napproximately $17.6 million, compared to approximately $19.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\ndecrease in interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was substantially related to decreases in the amount of\ndebt attributable to the mortgages on the hotel properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina, sold in 2022, as well\nas the extinguishment of the secured notes with KWHP SOHO, LLC (\"KW\") and MIG SOHO, LLC (the \"Secured Notes\") in June\n2022.\nInterest Income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased approximately $0.6 million, or 323.8%, to\napproximately $0.8 million compared to approximately $0.2 million of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\n43\nincrease in interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was substantially related to increases in the rates received\non available cash balances we maintained during the year.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The fiscal year 2022 loss relates to the repayment and cancellation of the Secured Notes\nin June 2022 resulting in a loss on early extinguishment consisting of the unamortized exit fee as well as the unamortized origination\ncosts, which totaled approximately $5.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. No losses were recorded for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2023.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Hedging Activities. Unrealized gain (loss) on hedging activities primarily relates to the change in\nvariance between the unamortized cost of the interest-rate swaps related to our mortgages on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia\nAirport, which matured at the end of July 2023, and the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton and the fair value of\ninterest-rate swaps which are affected by both the decreasing number of payment periods in the swap periods and the changes in\nanticipated SOFR rates over the remaining period. Those factors and the maturing of the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport's\ninterest-rate swap, contributed to an unrealized loss of approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to\nan unrealized gain of approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nPPP Loan Forgiveness. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received notification from our banks and the Small\nBusiness Administration that we received partial forgiveness on one of our unsecured notes, relating to the original PPP Loans we\nreceived in 2020. We received approximately $0.3 million PPP loan forgiveness, which includes principal forgiveness and the\naccrued interest on that portion of the loans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received notification from our banks and\nthe Small Business Administration that we received partial forgiveness on another of our unsecured notes in the amount of\napproximately $4.7 million PPP loan forgiveness, which included principal forgiveness and the accrued interest on that portion of the\nloans.\nGain on Sale of Assets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we sold the property in Raleigh, North Carolina\nfor a gain of approximately $30.1 million. We had no sales of property during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets. Gain on involuntary conversion of assets decreased approximately $0.4 million, to\napproximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from approximately $1.8 million, for the year ended December 31,\n2022. The gains were related to casualties at our properties in Savannah, Georgia, Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision). We had an income tax benefit of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023, compared to an income tax provision of approximately $0.5 million, for the year ended 2022. MHI TRS realized an operating\nloss for the year ended December 31, 2023 and an operating gain for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased approximately $30.2 million, or 88.8%, to\napproximately $3.8 million, compared to a net loss of approximately $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as a result\nof the operating results discussed above.\nDistributions to Preferred Stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we accounted for undeclared distributions\nto preferred stockholders of approximately $8.0 million, compared to declared and undeclared distributions to preferred stockholders\nof approximately $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2022 to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nThe following table illustrates the key operating metrics for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 for our wholly-owned\nhotels and the condominium hotel units, during each respective reporting period (“composite portfolio” properties), as well as the key\noperating metrics for the ten wholly-owned hotel properties that were under our control during all of 2022 (“actual” properties).\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021\nComposite Actual Composite Actual\nOccupancy % 60.0% 60.8% 52.5% 52.9%\nADR $ 181.34 $ 171.34 $ 160.51 $ 145.50\nRevPAR $ 108.87 $ 104.17 $ 84.29 $ 76.94\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $166.1 million, an increase of approximately\n$38.5 million, or 30.2%, from total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately $127.6 million. There was an\naggregate increase in total revenue of approximately $45.0 million from 10 of our properties, offset by a decrease of approximately\n$1.0 million, at the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences, Hollywood and a decrease of approximately $5.5 million as a result of\nthe sales of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in February 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh\n44\nBrownstone University in Raleigh, North Carolina, in June 2022. There were significant increases in demand primarily driven by the\nlifting of restrictions on travel, social gatherings and businesses as well as significant increases in demand for business travel\ncompared to the same period in the prior year.\nRoom revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately $21.0 million, or 23.6%, to\napproximately $109.6 million compared to room revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately $88.6 million with\neleven of our properties experiencing increased occupancies.\nFood and beverage revenues at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately $13.7 million, or\n86.7%, to approximately $29.5 million compared to food and beverage revenues of approximately $15.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, with most of our properties experiencing increased demand for food and beverage services as a result of increased\noccupancy. The increase in food and beverage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulted from an aggregate increase of\napproximately $14.2 million from ten of our properties, offset by the loss of food and beverage revenue of approximately $0.5 million\nfollowing the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside, in February 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone\nUniversity in June 2022.\nOther operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately $3.8 million, or 16.5%, to\napproximately $26.9 million compared to other operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately $23.1\nmillion. Increases in parking revenue at many of our properties, as well as approximately $1.0 million of other reimbursed revenue at\nthe Georgian Terrace in Atlanta, Georgia, $1.0 million received under the North Carolina Business Recovery Grant, offset decreases\n40 in fees of approximately $1.0 million earned at the Hyde Resort & Residences in Hollywood Beach, Florida; a non-recurring $0.2\nmillion in business interruption proceeds earned in the prior year at the Hotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection by Hilton in\nWilmington, North Carolina; and a non-recurring COVID relief grant of approximately $0.3 million received in the prior period by the\nDoubleTree by Hilton Laurel in Laurel, Maryland.\nHotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses, which consist of room expenses, food and beverage expenses, other direct\nexpenses, indirect expenses, and management fees, increased approximately $22.9 million, or 23.7%, for the year ended December 31,\n2022 to approximately $119.6 million compared to hotel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately\n$96.7 million. The aggregate increase of approximately $28.9 million in hotel operating expenses for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2022, is directly related to the significant increase in hotel occupancy and gross revenue at all of our properties, which\nwas mainly offset with the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside in February 2022 and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh\nBrownstone University in June 2022, reducing hotel operating expenses by approximately $5.7 million.\nRooms expense at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately $3.1 million, or 13.6%, to\napproximately $25.8 million compared to rooms expense of approximately $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The\nincrease in rooms expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulted from an aggregate increase of approximately $5.0 million\nfrom all of our properties, offset by a decrease of approximately $1.9 million as a result of the sale of our properties in Jeffersonville,\nIndiana and Raleigh, North Carolina.\nFood and beverage expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately $9.4 million, or\n91.5%, to approximately $19.7 million compared to food and beverage expense of approximately $10.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. The net increase in food and beverage expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, resulted from\nan aggregate increase of approximately $9.7 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $0.3 million as a result of the sale of our\nproperties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina.\nExpenses from other operating departments increased approximately $0.7 million, or 8.0%, to approximately $9.3 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, compared to expenses from other operating departments of approximately $8.6 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021. The increase in expenses from other operating departments for the twelve months ended December\n31, 2021, resulted from aggregate increases in other operating expenses of approximately $1.3 million from ten of our properties.\nThese increases were seen mainly from bringing back parking servicing contractors. Four of our properties, including the properties\nin Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina, had decreases in other operating expenses aggregating to approximately $0.6\nmillion.\nIndirect expenses at our properties for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately $9.7 million, or 17.6%, to\napproximately $64.8 million compared to indirect expenses of approximately $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe increase in indirect expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, resulted from an aggregate increase in total\nindirect expenses of approximately $13.1 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $3.4 million as a result of the sale of our\nproperties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina. Additionally, we realized refunds of prior year real estate property\ntaxes at our properties in Savannah, Georgia, and the DoubleTree by Hilton Hollywood Beach in Hollywood, Florida, totaling\napproximately $0.8 million.\n45\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by\napproximately $1.3 million or 6.3%, to approximately $18.6 million, compared to depreciation and amortization expense of\napproximately $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is mainly due to the sale of our properties in\nJeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina.\nImpairment of Investment in Hotel Properties, Net. The impairment of investment in hotel properties, net for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 was $0 and approximately $12.2 million, respectively. Our review of possible impairment at two of our\nhotel properties in 2021 revealed an excess of current carrying costs over the estimated undiscounted cash flows, which was triggered\nby a reduction in the holding period due to the recent sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside and a lack of certainty regarding our\nability to extend or refinance the mortgage on The Whitehall in Houston, Texas, which was to mature in 2023. The resulting\nadjustment to fair market value resulted in a charge of approximately $12.2 million during the period ended December 31, 2021.\nCorporate General and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022\ndecreased approximately $0.4 million, or 5.4%, to approximately $6.6 million compared to corporate general and administrative\nexpenses of approximately $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in corporate general and administrative\nexpenses was mainly due to an employee retention credit of approximately $0.2 million and a reduction of loan fees and other\nexpenses in the aggregate compared to the prior year of approximately $0.2 million.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased approximately $2.9 million, or 12.8%, to\napproximately $19.8 million, compared to approximately $22.7 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease in interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, was substantially related to decreases in the amount of\ndebt attributable to the mortgages on the hotel properties in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina, sold earlier this year,\nas well as the extinguishment of the secured notes with KWHP SOHO, LLC (\"KW\") and MIG SOHO, LLC (the \"Secured Notes\") in\nJune 2022.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The loss relates to the repayment and cancellation of the Secured Notes in June 2022\nresulting in a loss on early extinguishment consisting of the unamortized exit fee as well as the unamortized origination costs, which\ntotaled approximately $5.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Hedging Activities. Unrealized gain (loss) on hedging activities primarily relates to the change in\nvariance between the unamortized cost of the interest-rate swaps related to our mortgages on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia\nAirport and the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton and the fair value of interest-rate swaps which are affected by both\nthe decreasing number of payment periods in the swap periods and the changes in anticipated LIBOR/SOFR rates over the remaining\nperiod. Those factors contributed to an unrealized gain of approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\ncompared to an unrealized gain of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nPPP loan forgiveness. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we received notification from our banks and the Small Business\nAdministration that we received partial forgiveness on our unsecured notes, relating to the original PPP Loans we received in 2020.\nWe received approximately $4.7 million PPP loan forgiveness, which includes principal forgiveness and the accrued interest on that\nportion of the loans.\nGain on Sale of Assets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we sold the property in Raleigh, North Carolina\nfor a gain of approximately $30.1 million.\nGain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets. Gain on involuntary conversion of assets increased approximately $1.2 million, from\napproximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately $1.8 million, for the year ended December 31,\n2022. The gains were related to casualties at our properties in Savannah, Georgia, Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit. We had an income tax provision of approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December\n31, 2022, compared to an income tax provision of approximately $0, for the year ended December 31, 2021. MHI TRS realized an\noperating gain for the year ended December 31, 2022 and an operating loss for December 31, 2021.\nNet (Loss) Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased approximately $62.5 million, or 219.0%, to\napproximately $34.0 million, compared to a net loss of approximately $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result\nof the operating results discussed above.\nDistributions to Preferred Stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we accounted for undeclared distributions\nto preferred stockholders of approximately $7.6 million, compared to declared and undeclared distributions to preferred stockholders\nof approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n46\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur principal sources of cash are cash from hotel operations, proceeds from the sale of common and preferred stock, proceeds\nfrom the sale of secured and unsecured notes, proceeds of mortgage or other debt and hotel property sales. Our principal uses of cash\nare acquisitions of hotel properties, capital expenditures, debt service and balloon maturities, operating costs, corporate expenses and\ndividends. As of December 31, 2023, we had unrestricted cash of approximately $17.1 million and restricted cash of approximately\n$9.1 million. Our net decrease in cash for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $1.1 million, generally consisting of\nnet cash flow used in hotel operations. The positive cash flow from operations during the year was due to the increase in occupancy at\nour hotels as a result of increases in transient consumers, group business, and other business travel due to the lifting of restrictions on\ntravel, social gatherings and business operations.\nOperating Activities. Our cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $21.4\nmillion. Our cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $6.7 million. Our cash\nprovided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $2.3 million. Cash used in or provided by\noperating activities generally consists of the cash flow from hotel operations, offset by the interest portion of our debt service,\ncorporate expenses and positive or negative changes in working capital.\nInvesting Activities. Our cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $6.7 million.\nOf this amount approximately $8.2 million was used for capital expenditures, including the replacement and refurbishment of\nfurniture, fixtures and equipment offset by insurance proceeds of approximately $1.3 million. Cash provided by investing activities\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, was approximately $46.7 million. Of this amount approximately $10.9 million came from the\nsale of Sheraton Louisville Riverside property and approximately $41.5 million came from the sale of the DoubleTree by Hilton\nRaleigh Brownstone University property and we used approximately $8.0 million on capital expenditures, which was offset by\ninsurance proceeds of approximately $2.2 million. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was\napproximately $2.4 million which mostly consisted of capital expenditures of approximately $3.2 million offset by insurance proceeds\nof approximately $0.6 million.\nFinancing Activities. Our cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $15.8\nmillion. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company and Operating Partnership received proceeds of $2.7 million from\nthe refinance of the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel mortgage loan, made scheduled principal payments on its mortgages of\napproximately $7.3 million, paid approximately $0.5 million in deferred financing costs, and made scheduled principal payments of\napproximately $0.7 million on its unsecured notes. We also paid distributions to preferred stockholders in the amount of\napproximately $10.0 million. Our cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was approximately $51.6\nmillion. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company and Operating Partnership received proceeds of $7.8 million from\nthe refinance of the mortgage loan on the Hotel Alba, made scheduled principal payments on its mortgages of approximately $9.3\nmillion including the repayment of principal payments deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as approximately $29.2\nmillion in principal payments related to the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside and the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh\nBrownstone University. In addition, the Company extinguished debt on its Secured Notes of $20.0 million and paid approximately\n$0.4 million in deferred financing costs. We also paid approximately $0.5 million to reduce the principal balance outstanding of\nunsecured notes. Cash used in financial activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, was approximately $9.7 million, which\nincluded approximately $6.5 million in scheduled payments of principal on our mortgage loans and approximately $3.1 million in\npayments of principal on our unsecured notes.\n47\nCapital Expenditures\nWe intend to maintain all our hotels, including any hotel we acquire in the future, in good repair and condition, in conformity\nwith applicable laws and regulations and, when applicable, with franchisor’s standards. Routine capital improvements are determined\nthrough the annual budget process over which we maintain approval rights, and which are implemented or administered by our\nmanagement company.\nFrom time to time, certain of our hotel properties may undergo renovations as a result of our decision to upgrade portions of the\nhotel, such as guestrooms, meeting space and restaurants, in order to better compete with other hotels in our markets. In addition, we\nmay be required by one or more of our franchisors to complete a property improvement program (“PIP”) in order to bring the hotel up\nto the franchisor’s standards. In October 2024, the DoubleTree by Hilton franchise license on our property in Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania expires. We anticipate we will be required to agree to a PIP with respect to any new franchise license and anticipate the\nassociated expenditure to range between $9.5 million and $11.0 million beginning the third quarter 2024 and extending through 2026.\nGenerally, we expect to fund such renovations and improvements out of working capital, including reserve accounts established by\nour lenders, and proceeds of mortgage debt or equity offerings.\nHistorically, we have aimed to maintain overall capital expenditures, except for those required by our franchisors as a condition\nto a franchise license or license renewal, at 4.0% of gross revenue. We expect total capital expenditures for 2024 to be approximately\n$7.0 million.\nWe generally expect capital expenditures for the recurring replacement or refurbishment of furniture, fixtures and equipment at\nour properties will be funded by our replacement reserve accounts, other than costs that we incur to make capital improvements\nrequired by our franchisors. Reserve accounts are escrowed accounts with funds deposited monthly and reserved for capital\nimprovements or expenditures with respect to all of our hotels. We deposit an amount equal to 4.0% of gross revenue for The DeSoto,\nthe Hotel Ballast Wilmington, the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel, the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach, The DoubleTree\nby Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, The Whitehall, Hotel Alba, and the Georgian Terrace, as well as 4.0% of room revenues for the\nDoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the Hyatt Centric Arlington on a monthly basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results during 2021 and 2022.\nDuring 2021, we entered into forbearance agreements with all our mortgage lenders and negotiated extended payment terms\nwith a few key vendors in order to preserve liquidity. Repayment of deferred amounts of interest, mortgage principal and amounts due\ncertain vendors, which began in 2021, was completed at the end of 2022, with the exception of certain amounts that were deferred\nuntil the maturity of the applicable loans.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $26.2 million, of which\napproximately $9.1 million was in restricted reserve accounts for cash collateral, capital improvements, real estate tax and insurance\nescrows. We expect that our cash on hand combined with our cash flow from our hotels should be adequate to fund continuing\noperations, recurring capital expenditures for the refurbishment and replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment, and monthly\nscheduled payments of principal and interest (excluding any balloon payments due upon maturity of our mortgage debt or secured\nnotes).\nOn February 26, 2023, we amended the mortgage loan agreement on The Whitehall hotel located in Houston, Texas with the\nexisting lender, International Bank of Commerce. The amendment (i) extends the loan's maturity date to February 26, 2028; (ii)\nmaintains a floating rate of interest of New York Prime Rate plus 1.25%; and (iii) subjects the interest rate to a floor rate of 7.50%.\nThe mortgage loan continues to be guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. The amendment also requires us to establish a real estate\ntax reserve as well as a debt service reserve that approximates the aggregate amount of one year's debt service, which was initially\nestablished at approximately $1.5 million.\nOn May 4, 2023, we secured a $10.0 million mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel located in Laurel, Maryland\nwith Citi Real Estate Funding Inc. Pursuant to the loan documents, the loan has a maturity date of May 6, 2028; carries a fixed rate of\ninterest of 7.35%; requires monthly payments of interest only; and cannot be prepaid until the last four months of the loan term. We\nused a portion of the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the hotel and will use the balance of the proceeds for general\ncorporate purposes.\nOn February 7, 2024, we secured a $35.0 million mortgage loan on the Hotel Alba located in Tampa, Florida with Citi Real\nEstate Funding Inc. Pursuant to the loan documents, the loan has a maturity date of March 6, 2029; carries a fixed rate of interest of\n8.49%; requires monthly payments of interest only; and cannot be prepaid until the last four months of the loan term. We used a\n48\nportion of the proceeds to repay the existing first mortgage on the hotel and will use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate\npurposes.\nAs of the date of this report, we were current on all loan payments on all other mortgages per the terms of our mortgage\nagreements, as amended. We were in compliance with all loan covenants except the Debt Service Coverage Requirement (“DSCR”)\ncovenant under the mortgage secured by the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport. The mortgage was set to mature on October\n31, 2023, but was extended to April 29, 2024 pursuant to a series of amendments to the loan agreement. We anticipate a further\nextension of the maturity date the loan for an additional 24 months as well as a waiver of the non-compliance with the financial\ncovenant subject to additional terms and conditions which may include a reduction of the principal balance and deposits into interest,\nFF&E and other reserve accounts.\nIn July 2024, the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront matures. We intend to refinance the mortgage\nat the expected level of maturing indebtedness. In May and October 2025, the mortgages on the Georgian Terrace and the DoubleTree\nResort by Hilton Hollywood Beach, respectively, mature. We intend to refinance the mortgages at the expected level of maturing\nindebtedness. Should the proceeds of any mortgage refinance not be sufficient to repay the level of maturing indebtedness, we may be\nrequired to use available working capital. Additionally, we may choose to dispose of certain hotels as a means to provide liquidity.\nOver the long term, we expect to meet our liquidity requirements for hotel property acquisitions, property redevelopment,\ninvestments in new joint ventures and debt maturities, and the retirement of maturing mortgage debt, through net proceeds from\nadditional issuances of common shares, additional issuances of preferred shares, issuances of units of limited partnership interest in\nour Operating Partnership, secured and unsecured borrowings, the selective disposition of non-core assets, continued suspension of\nour common dividend, suspension of our preferred dividend, and cash on hand. We remain committed to a flexible capital structure\nand strive to maintain prudent debt leverage.\nMortgage Debt\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a principal mortgage debt balance of approximately $317.4 million. The following table sets\nforth our mortgage debt obligations on our hotels.\nDecember 31, Prepayment Maturity Amortization\nProperty 2023 Penalties Date Provisions Interest Rate\nThe DeSoto (1) $ 30,248,929 Yes 7/1/2026 25 years 4.25%\nDoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville\nRiverfront (2) 31,749,695 Yes 7/11/2024 30 years 4.88%\nDoubleTree by Hilton Laurel (3) 10,000,000 (3) 5/6/2028 (3) 7.35%\nDoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport (4) 38,915,488 None 2/29/2024 30 years SOFR plus 2.27%\nDoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood\nBeach (5) 51,495,662 (5) 10/1/2025 30 years 4.91%\nGeorgian Terrace (6) 39,455,095 (6) 6/1/2025 30 years 4.42%\nHotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by\nHilton (7) 24,269,200 None 6/30/2025 (7) SOFR plus 2.75%\nHotel Ballast Wilmington, Tapestry Collection\nby Hilton (8) 30,755,374 Yes 1/1/2027 25 years 4.25%\nHyatt Centric Arlington (9) 46,454,972 Yes 10/1/2028 30 years 5.25%\nPRIME\nThe Whitehall (10) 14,009,874 None 2/26/2028 25 years plus 1.25%\nTotal Mortgage Principal Balance 317,354,289\nDeferred financing costs, net (1,407,979)\nUnamortized premium on loan 42,884\nTotal Mortgage Loans, Net $ 315,989,194\n(1) The note amortizes on a 25-year schedule after an initial interest-only period of one year and is subject to a pre-payment penalty except for any pre-payments\nmade within 120 days of the maturity date.\n(2) The note is subject to a pre-payment penalty until March 2024. Prepayment can be made without penalty thereafter.\n(3) The note requires payments of interest only and cannot be prepaid until the last 4 months of the loan term.\n(4) The note bore a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 2.27%. On August 13, 2018, we entered into a swap agreement to fix the rate at 5.237% through July 31,\n2023. Notional amounts under the swap agreement approximated the declining balance of the loan. Effective October 29, 2023, the loan agreement was\namended to increase the interest rate to SOFR plus 3.50%. Subsequent loan amendments have extended the maturity date to April 29, 2024.\n(5) With limited exception, the note may not be prepaid prior to June 2025.\n(6) With limited exception, the note may not be prepaid prior to February 2025.\n(7) The note bore a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 2.75% subject to a floor rate of 2.75% with monthly principal payments of $40,600. On July 11, 2022, we\nentered into a swap agreement to fix the rate at 5.576% with notional amounts that approximate to the declining balance of the loan. On February 7, 2024, we\n49\nsecured a new $35.0 million mortgage loan which bears a rate of 8.49%; requires payments of interest only; matures on March 6, 2029; and cannot be prepaid\nuntil the last 4 months of the loan term.\n(8) The note amortizes on a 25-year schedule after an initial interest-only period of one year and is subject to a pre-payment penalty except for any pre-payments\nmade within 120 days of the maturity date.\n(9) Following a 5-year lockout, the note can be prepaid with penalty in years 6-10 and without penalty during the final 4 months of the term.\n(10) The note bears a floating interest rate of New York Prime Rate plus 1.25%, with a floor of 7.50%.\nFinancial Covenants\nMortgage Loans\nOur mortgage loan agreements contain various financial covenants directly related to the financial performance of the\ncollateralized properties. Failure to comply with these financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in the local\ncompetitive environment, disruption caused by renovation activity, major weather disturbances, general economic conditions as well\nas the changes in business travel patterns and demand following the global pandemic.\nAs described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” as of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants,\ncurrent on all loan payments and not otherwise in default under any of our mortgage loans, with the exception of a covenant default\nunder the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport. We anticipate a waiver of non-compliance in conjunction with\nan extension of the loan term.\nCertain of our loan agreements also include financial covenants that trigger a “cash trap”. At December 31, 2023, we failed to\nmeet the financial covenants under the mortgages secured by the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach as well as the\nGeorgian Terrace, which trigger “cash traps” under the loan documents, requiring substantially all the revenue generated by the hotel\nto be deposited directly into a lockbox account and swept into a cash management account for the benefit of the lender until the\nproperty meets the criteria in the loan agreement for exiting the “cash trap”.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table outlines our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023, and the effect such obligations are expected\nto have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands).\nPayments due by period (in thousands)\nLess than More than\nContractual Obligations Total 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years\nMortgage loans, including interest $ 375,964 $ 91,263 $ 171,419 $ 77,745 $ 35,537\nUnsecured Notes 1,552 1,552 - - -\nGround, building, parking garage, office and\nequipment leases 13,938 607 1,221 1,274 10,836\nTotals $ 391,454 $ 93,422 $ 172,640 $ 79,019 $ 46,373\nDividend Policy\nThe Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2004. To maintain\nqualification as a REIT, the Company is required to make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90.0% of our REIT\ntaxable income, (excluding net capital gain, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles). The Company’s ability to pay distributions to its stockholders will depend, in part, upon its receipt of\ndistributions from the Operating Partnership which may depend upon receipt of lease payments with respect to our properties from our\nTRS Lessees, and in turn, upon the management of our properties by our hotel manager. Distributions to the Company’s stockholders\nwill generally be taxable to the Company’s stockholders as ordinary income; however, because a portion of our investments are equity\nownership interests in hotels, which will result in depreciation and noncash charges against our income, a portion of our distributions\nmay constitute a non-taxable return of capital. To the extent not inconsistent with maintaining the Company’s REIT status, our TRS\nLessees may retain any after-tax earnings.\nDistributions to Stockholders and Holders of Units in the Operating Partnership The Company may not make distributions\nwith respect to any shares of its common stock, unless and until full cumulative distributions on the outstanding preferred stock for all\npast unpaid periods are paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set aside.\nDistributions to Preferred Stockholders and Holder of Preferred Partnership Units in the Operating Partnership. On January\n24, 2023, the Company announced that it will resume quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock and set a record date of\nFebruary 28, 2023 with a payment date of March 15, 2023.\n50\nOn April 24, 2023, the Company announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock and with\na record date of May 31, 2023 with a payment date of June 15, 2023.\nOn May 30, 2023, the Company announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock and with\na record date of June 30, 2023 with a payment date of July 14, 2023.\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock and\nwith a record date of August 31, 2023 with a payment date of September 15, 2023.\nOn October 31, 2023, the Company announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock and\nwith a record date of November 30, 2023 with a payment date of December 15, 2023.\nOn January 30, 2024, the Company announced the declaration of a quarterly distribution to holders of our preferred stock and\nwith a record date of February 29, 2024 with a payment date of March 15, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the amount of cumulative unpaid dividends on our outstanding preferred shares was approximately\n$21.9 million and the aggregate liquidation preference with respect to our outstanding preferred shares was approximately $121.3\nmillion. The preferred stock is not redeemable by the holders, has no maturity date and is not convertible into any other security of the\nCompany or its affiliates, except in the event of a change of control.\nInflation\nWe generate revenues primarily from lease payments from our TRS Lessees and net income from the operations of our TRS\nLessees. Therefore, we rely primarily on the performance of the individual properties and the ability of the management company to\nincrease revenues and to keep pace with inflation. Operators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to keep\npace with inflation. However, competitive pressures at some or all of our hotels may limit the ability of the management company to\nraise room rates.\nOur expenses, including hotel operating expenses, administrative expenses, real estate taxes, and property and casualty\ninsurance are subject to inflation. These expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation, except for energy, liability\ninsurance, property and casualty insurance, property tax rates, employee benefits, and some wages, which may vary at rates that differ\nfrom the general rate of inflation.\nGeographic Concentration and Seasonality\nOur hotels are located in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. As a result, we are\nparticularly susceptible to adverse market conditions in these geographic areas, including industry downturns, relocation of businesses\nand any oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand. Adverse economic developments in the markets in which we\nhave a concentration of hotels, or in any of the other markets in which we operate, or any increase in hotel supply or decrease in\nlodging demand resulting from the local, regional or national business climate, could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe operations of our hotel properties have historically been seasonal. The months of April and May are traditionally strong, as\nis October. The periods from mid-November through mid-February are traditionally slow with the exception of hotels located in\ncertain markets, namely Florida and Texas, which experience significant room demand during this period.\nCompetition\nThe hotel industry is highly competitive with various participants competing on the basis of price, level of service and\ngeographic location. Each of our hotels is located in a developed area that includes other hotel properties. The number of competitive\nhotel properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy, ADR and RevPAR of our hotels or at hotel\nproperties acquired in the future. We believe that brand recognition, location, the quality of the hotel, consistency of services provided,\nand price, are the principal competitive factors affecting our hotels.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements, prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, require management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liability at the date of our financial statements, the reported amounts of\nrevenue and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying footnotes. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Summary of\n51\nSignificant Accounting Policies, in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K, the following accounting policies are critical because they require difficult, subjective and complex judgments and include\nestimates about matters that are inherently uncertain, involve various assumptions, require management judgment, and because they\nare important for understanding and evaluating our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. We evaluate our\nestimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis, based on information that is available to us, our historical experiences and\nvarious matters that we believe are reasonable and appropriate for consideration under the circumstances. Actual results may differ\nsignificantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or\notherwise, which could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nInvestment in Hotel Properties. Hotel properties are stated at cost, net of any impairment charges, and are depreciated using the\nstraight-line method over an estimated useful life of 7-39 years for buildings and improvements and 3-10 years for furniture and\nequipment. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the controlling interests in hotels comprising our accounting\npredecessor, MHI Hotels Services Group, and noncontrolling interests held by the controlling holders of our accounting predecessor in\nhotels, which were acquired from third parties contributed to us in connection with the Company’s initial public offering, are recorded\nat historical cost basis. Noncontrolling interests in those entities that comprise our accounting predecessor and the interests in hotels,\nother than those held by the controlling members of our accounting predecessor, acquired from third parties are recorded at fair value\nat the time of acquisition.\nWe review our hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the\nhotel properties may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause us to perform our review include, but are not limited\nto, adverse permanent changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions\nand/or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located. When such conditions exist, management performs a\nrecoverability analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities and the estimated\nproceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceed its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows\nare found to be less than the carrying amount of the hotel property, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the related hotel\nproperty’s estimated fair market value would be recorded and an impairment loss recognized.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, an adverse impact on the lodging and hospitality industries, which the Company considered\nto be a triggering event for each of its hotels during its impairment testing for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company\nassessed the recoverability of each of its hotel properties which included a projection of future operating cash flows based upon\nsignificant assumptions regarding its ability to maintain ownership of the property, growth rates, occupancy, room rates, economic\ntrends, property-specific operating costs, an allowance for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment and projected cash\nflows from the eventual disposition of the hotel. The Company also projected cash flows assuming an eventual disposition of the\nhotel based upon property-specific capitalization rates. As of December 31, 2021, the Company determined the Sheraton Louisville\nRiverside, to be impaired based on the proceeds received in a subsequent sale, as well as The Whitehall in Houston, Texas due to the\nlack of certainty regarding our ability to extend or refinance the mortgage which was set to mature in early 2023. The Company\nrecognized an impairment loss of approximately $12.2 million during the period ended December 31, 2021. The impairment loss was\ndetermined using level 2 inputs under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. No impairment loss was recognized for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax. The MHI TRS Entities which\nleases our hotels from subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, are subject to federal and state income taxes.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized\nfor the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if, based on all available evidence, it\nis “more-likely-than-not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will or will not be realized due to the inability to generate\nsufficient taxable income in certain financial statement periods. The “more-likely-than-not” analysis means the likelihood of\nrealization is greater than 50%, that we either will or will not be able to fully utilize the deferred tax assets against future taxable\nincome. The net amount of deferred tax assets that are recorded on the financial statements must reflect the tax benefits that are\nexpected to be realized using these criteria. As of December 31, 2023, we have determined that it is more-likely-than-not that we will\nnot be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets for future tax consequences, therefore a 100% valuation allowance is required. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred tax assets each totaled $0, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had no uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to\nuncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major\ntax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject generally include 2015 through 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, the tax\nyears that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which the MHI TRS Entities are subject, because of open\nNOL carryforwards, generally include 2017 and 2019 through 2022.\n52\nThe Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as the unit holders of the Partnership are\nsubject to tax on their respective shares of the Partnership’s taxable income.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a summary of recently adopted and newly issued accounting pronouncements, please refer to the New Accounting\nPronouncements section of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe consider the non-GAAP financial measures of FFO available to common stockholders and unitholders (including FFO per\ncommon share and unit), Adjusted FFO available to common stockholders and unitholders, EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA to be key\nsupplemental measures of the Company’s performance and could be considered along with, not alternatives to, net income (loss) as a\nmeasure of the Company’s performance. These measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or amounts available for the Company’s discretionary use and should not be\nconsidered alternative measures of net income, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by\nGAAP.\nFFO and Adjusted FFO. Industry analysts and investors use FFO, as a supplemental operating performance measure of an\nequity REIT. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income or loss determined in accordance\nwith GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating\nreal estate assets, gains or losses from involuntary conversion of assets, plus certain non-cash items such as real estate asset\ndepreciation and amortization or impairment and after adjustment for any noncontrolling interest from unconsolidated partnerships\nand joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real\nestate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions,\nmany investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost\naccounting to be insufficient by itself.\nWe consider FFO to be a useful measure of adjusted net income (loss) for reviewing comparative operating and financial\nperformance because we believe FFO is most directly comparable to net income (loss), which remains the primary measure of\nperformance, because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding\nreal estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating performance of a company’s real estate\nbetween periods or as compared to different companies. Although FFO is intended to be a REIT industry standard, other companies\nmay not calculate FFO in the same manner as we do, and investors should not assume that FFO as reported by us is comparable to\nFFO as reported by other REITs.\nWe further adjust FFO Available to Common Stockholders and Unitholders for certain additional items that are not in\nNAREIT’s definition of FFO, including changes in deferred income taxes, any unrealized gain (loss) on hedging instruments or\nwarrant derivatives, loan impairment losses, losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains on extinguishment of preferred stock,\naborted offering costs, loan modification fees, franchise termination costs, costs associated with the departure of executive officers,\nstock compensation costs, litigation settlement, over-assessed real estate taxes on appeal, management contract termination costs,\noperating asset depreciation and amortization, change in control gains or losses, ESOP and stock compensation expenses and\nacquisition transaction costs. We exclude these items as we believe it allows for meaningful comparisons between periods and among\nother REITs and is more indicative than FFO of the on-going performance of our business and assets. Our calculation of adjusted\nFFO may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and Adjusted FFO for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021.\n53\nYear Ended Year Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income (loss) $ 3,809,711 $ 33,959,848 $ (28,539,640)\nDepreciation and amortization - real estate 18,735,804 18,593,359 19,838,017\nImpairment of investment in hotel properties, net — — 12,201,461\nLoss (gain) on disposal of assets (4,700) 636,198 (158,286)\nGain on sale of hotel properties — (30,053,977) —\nDistributions to preferred stockholders (7,977,250) (7,634,219) (7,541,891)\nGain on involuntary conversion of asset (1,371,041) (1,763,320) (588,586)\nFFO available to common stockholders and unitholders $ 13,192,524 $ 13,737,889 $ (4,788,925)\nAmortization 52,944 56,977 71,209\nESOP and stock - based compensation 559,220 998,424 689,547\nAborted offering costs — — 631,952\nUnrealized (gain) loss on hedging activities 737,682 (2,918,207) (1,493,841)\nLoss on early debt extinguishment — 5,944,881 —\nAdjusted FFO available to common stockholders and\nunitholders $ 14,542,370 $ 17,819,964 $ (4,890,058)\nHotel EBITDA. We define Hotel EBITDA as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) income\ntax provision or benefit, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) impairment of long-lived assets or investments, (6) gains and losses on\ndisposal and/or sale of assets, (7) gains and losses on involuntary conversions of assets, (8) unrealized gains and losses on derivative\ninstruments not included in other comprehensive income, (9) other income at the properties, (10) loss on early debt extinguishment,\n(11) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) debt forgiveness, (12) gain on exercise of development right, (13) corporate general and\nadministrative expense, and (14) other income not related to our wholly-owned portfolio. We believe this provides a more complete\nunderstanding of the operating results over which our wholly-owned hotels and its operators have direct control. We believe hotel\nEBITDA provides investors with supplemental information on the on-going operational performance of our hotels and the\neffectiveness of third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis.\nOur calculation of Hotel EBITDA may be different from similar measures calculated by other REITs.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net loss to Hotel EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nYear Ended Year Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet (loss) income $ 3,809,711 $ 33,959,848 $ (28,539,640)\nInterest expense 17,588,091 19,772,802 22,686,694\nInterest income (802,183) (189,291) (147,025)\nIncome tax provision (304,947) 522,355 27,392\nDepreciation and amortization 18,788,748 18,650,336 19,909,226\nImpairment of investment in hotel properties, net — — 12,201,461\nUnrealized (gain) loss on hedging activities 737,682 (2,918,207) (1,493,841)\nLoss on early debt extinguishment — 5,944,881 —\nGain on sale of hotel properties — (30,053,977) —\nLoss (gain) on disposal of assets (4,700) 636,198 (158,286)\nPPP loan forgiveness (275,494) (4,720,278) —\nOther income (456,388) — —\nGain on involuntary conversion of asset (1,371,041) (1,763,320) (588,586)\nCorporate general and administrative expenses 7,078,222 6,621,221 6,997,166\nHotel EBITDA $ 44,787,701 $ 46,462,568 $ 30,894,561\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThe effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below. Our market risk discussion includes “forward-looking\nstatements” and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that could occur assuming hypothetical\nfuture movements in interest rates. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of\n54\nreasonably possible losses. As a result, actual future results may differ materially from those presented. The analysis below presents\nthe sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates.\nTo meet in part our long-term liquidity requirements, we will borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Our\ninterest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our\noverall borrowing costs. From time to time we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars and treasury lock\nagreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We do not intend to hold or issue\nderivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $266.0 million of fixed-rate debt, including the mortgage on our Hotel Alba\nTampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, which is fixed by an interest rate swap to 5.576% and the PPP Loans of $1.5 million, with a\nfixed rate of 1.0% and approximately $52.9 million of variable-rate debt. The weighted-average interest rate on the fixed-rate debt\nwas 4.87%. A change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of our debt would impact the fair value of the debt but have no\nimpact on interest incurred or cash flows. Our variable-rate debt is exposed to changes in interest rates, specifically the changes in 1-\nmonth LIBOR, SOFR, and in Prime Rate. Assuming that the aggregate amounts outstanding on the mortgage on The Whitehall\nremains at approximately $14.0 million and the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport remains at approximately\n$38.9 million, the balance at December 31, 2023, the impact on our annual interest incurred and cash flows of a one percent increase\nin 1-month SOFR and in Prime Rate, would be approximately $0.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $310.2 million of fixed-rate debt, including the mortgage on our DoubleTree\nby Hilton Philadelphia Airport hotel, which is fixed by an interest rate swap to 5.237%, the mortgage on our Hotel Alba Tampa,\nTapestry Collection by Hilton, which is fixed by an interest rate swap to 5.576% and the PPP Loans of $2.5 million, with a fixed rate\nof 1.0% and approximately $14.2 million of variable-rate debt. The weighted-average interest rate on the fixed-rate debt was 4.83%.\nA change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of our debt would impact the fair value of the debt but have no impact on\ninterest incurred or cash flows. Our variable-rate debt is exposed to changes in interest rates, specifically the changes in 1-month\nLIBOR, SOFR, and in Prime Rate. Assuming that the aggregate amount outstanding on the mortgage on The Whitehall remains at\napproximately $14.2 million, the balance at December 31, 2022, the impact on our annual interest incurred and cash flows of a one\npercent increase in 1-month LIBOR, SOFR, and in Prime Rate, would be approximately $0.1 million.\nItem 8.

Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial\nreporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we\nexpress no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or\non the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of investments in hotel properties for impairment\nAs of December 31, 2023, Investment in Hotel Properties was $354.9 Million. As discussed in Note 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company assesses the carrying values of its investments in hotel properties whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. When such conditions exist,\nmanagement performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from\nthe ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceeds its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are found to be\nless than the carrying amount of the asset and the carrying amount exceeds its fair market value, an adjustment to reduce the carrying\namount to the related hotel property’s fair market value would be recorded and an impairment loss recognized. We identified the\nCompany’s evaluation of hotel properties for impairment as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination\nincluded the significant auditor judgments required to evaluate certain key inputs and assumptions used by the Company in developing\ntheir impairment assessment, specifically, the judgments related to the Company’s determination of growth rates, occupancy, room\nrates, economic trends, property-specific operating costs and an allowance for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment\nused in projecting cash flows from operations and capitalization rates utilized in determining eventual disposition.\nF-2\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• We obtained an understanding of and tested the design and effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s\nimpairment analysis.\n• We acquired an understanding of the Company’s impairment methodology to assess the life of the cash flows and\nrecoverability of the investments in hotel properties (which is part of management’s initial triggering event test).\n• We assessed the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and inputs, such as growth rates, occupancy, room rates,\ncapitalization rates, property-specific operating costs and an allowance for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and\nequipment based on Company-specific data and published industry data.\n• We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s recoverability analysis (part of management's initial triggering\nevent test).\n• We performed a sensitivity analysis over the estimated capitalization rates obtained from published industry reports.\n• We reviewed the methodologies and assumptions utilized by the Company’s third-party specialist for reasonableness.\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's

Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors of the General Partner of Sotherly Hotels LP\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sotherly Hotels LP and subsidiaries (the “Partnership”) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in partners’ capital, and cash flows for each\nof the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for\neach of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial\nreporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we\nexpress no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or\non the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of investments in hotel properties for impairment\nAs of December 31, 2023, Investment in Hotel Properties was $354.9 Million. As discussed in Note 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Partnership assesses the carrying values of its investments in hotel properties whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. When such conditions exist,\nmanagement performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from\nthe ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceeds its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are found to be\nless than the carrying amount of the asset and the carrying amount exceeds its fair market value, an adjustment to reduce the carrying\namount to the related hotel property’s fair market value would be recorded and an impairment loss recognized.\nWe identified the Partnership’s evaluation of hotel properties for impairment as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for\nour determination included the significant auditor judgments required to evaluate certain key inputs and assumptions used by the\nPartnership in developing their impairment assessment, specifically, the judgments related to the Partnership’s determination of\ngrowth rates, occupancy, room rates, economic trends, property-specific operating costs and an allowance for the replacement of\nfurniture, fixtures and equipment used in projecting cash flows from operations and capitalization rates utilized in determining\neventual disposition.\nF-8\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• We obtained an understanding of and tested the design and effectiveness of internal controls over the Partnership’s\nimpairment analysis.\n• We acquired an understanding of the Partnership’s impairment methodology to assess the life of the cash flows and\nrecoverability of the investments in hotel properties (which is part of management’s initial triggering event test).\n• We assessed the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and inputs, such as growth rates, occupancy, room rates,\ncapitalization rates, property-specific operating costs and an allowance for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and\nequipment based on Partnership-specific data and published industry data.\n• We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s recoverability analysis (part of management's initial triggering\nevent test).\n• We performed a sensitivity analysis over the estimated capitalization rates obtained from published industry reports.\n• We reviewed the methodologies and assumptions utilized by the Partnership’s third-party specialists for reasonableness.\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nWe have served as the Partnership’s auditor since 2016.\nJacksonville, Florida\nMarch 22, 2024\nF-9\nSOTHERLY HOTELS LP\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nASSETS\nInvestment in hotel properties, net $ 354,919,106 $ 365,070,725\nCash and cash equivalents 17,101,993 21,918,680\nRestricted cash 9,134,347 5,422,950\nAccounts receivable, net 5,945,724 5,844,904\nLoan receivable - affiliate 1,744,532 2,650,526\nPrepaid expenses, inventory and other assets 6,342,310 8,311,862\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 395,188,012 $ 409,219,647\nLIABILITIES\nMortgage loans, net $ 315,989,194 $ 320,482,103\nUnsecured notes, net 1,536,809 2,545,975\nAccounts payable and other accrued liabilities 23,315,677 25,704,835\nAdvance deposits 2,614,981 2,233,013\nDividends and distributions payable 2,088,160 4,082,472\nTOTAL LIABILITIES $ 345,544,821 $ 355,048,398\nCommitments and contingencies (see Note 5) — —\nPARTNERS’ CAPITAL\nPreferred units, 11,000,000 units authorized;\n8.0% Series B cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred unit;\n1,464,100 and 1,464,100 units issued and outstanding; aggregate liquidation\npreference each $44,655,050, at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. $ 34,344,086 $ 34,344,086\n7.875% Series C cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units,\n1,346,110 and 1,346,110 units issued and outstanding; aggregate liquidation\npreference each $40,940,681, each at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. 31,571,778 31,571,778\n8.25% Series D cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units,\n1,163,100 and 1,163,100 units issued and outstanding; aggregate liquidation\npreference each $35,674,458, each at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. 27,504,901 27,504,901\nGeneral Partner: 205,220 units and 197,767 units issued and outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Organization and Description of Business\nSotherly Hotels Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-managed and self-administered lodging real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that\nwas incorporated in Maryland on August 20, 2004. The Company historically has focused on the acquisition, renovation, upbranding\nand repositioning of upscale to upper-upscale full-service hotels in the southern United States. The Company’s portfolio, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, consisted of investments in ten hotel properties, comprising 2,786 rooms and two hotel commercial condominium\nunits and their associated rental programs. Seven of our hotels operated under the DoubleTree by Hilton, Tapestry Collection by\nHilton, and Hyatt Centric brands, and three are independent hotels.\nThe Company commenced operations on December 21, 2004 when it completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) and thereafter\nconsummated the acquisition of six hotel properties. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are held by, and all of its operations are\nconducted through, Sotherly Hotels LP, (the “Operating Partnership”).\nPursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”), the\nCompany, as general partner, is not entitled to compensation for its services to the Operating Partnership. The Company, as general\npartner, conducts substantially all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Company’s administrative expenses are\nthe obligations of the Operating Partnership. Additionally, the Company is entitled to reimbursement for any expenditure incurred by\nit on the Operating Partnership’s behalf.\nFor the Company to qualify as a REIT, it cannot operate hotels. Therefore, the Operating Partnership, which, at December 31,\n2023, was approximately 98.2% owned by the Company, and its subsidiaries, lease its hotels to direct and indirect subsidiaries of MHI\nHospitality TRS Holding, Inc., MHI Hospitality TRS, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries, (collectively, “MHI TRS Entities”), each of\nwhich is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the MHI\nTRS Entities engaged an eligible independent hotel management company, Our Town Hospitality, LLC (“Our Town”), to operate the\nhotels under individual hotel management contracts. MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. is treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary\n(“TRS”) for federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2023, Our Town was the manager of each of our ten wholly-owned\nhotels and our two condominium hotel rental programs.\nAll references in these “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Company, its\nOperating Partnership and its subsidiaries and predecessors, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires or where otherwise\nindicated.\nSignificant Transactions\nSignificant transactions occurring during the current and two prior fiscal years include the following:\nBetween April 16 and May 6, 2020, the Company received proceeds of three separate PPP Loans administered by the U.S.\nSmall Business Administration pursuant to the CARES Act totaling approximately $10.7 million. Each PPP Loan had an initial term\nof two years with the ability to extend the loan to five years, if not completely forgiven and carries an interest rate of 1.00%. Equal\npayments of principal and interest were to begin no later than 10 months following origination of the loan and are amortized over the\nremaining term of the loan. Pursuant to the terms of the CARES Act, the proceeds of each PPP Loan may be used for payroll costs,\nmortgage interest, rent or utility costs. The promissory note for each PPP Loan contains customary events of default relating to,\namong other things, payment defaults and breach of representations and warranties or of provisions of the relevant promissory note.\nOn December 9, 2022, the Company was notified it had received forgiveness for one of its PPP Loans in the principal amount of\napproximately $4.6 million. On February 3, 2023, the Company was notified it has received forgiveness for another PPP Loan in the\nprincipal amount of approximately $0.3 million.\nOn December 31, 2020, we entered into the following agreements with KWHP SOHO, LLC (\"KW\") and MIG SOHO, LLC\n(together, the \"Investors\"): (i) a Note Purchase Agreement with the Investors; (ii) the Secured Notes; (iii) a Pledge and Security\nAgreement with KW; (iv) a Board Observer Agreement with KW; and (v) other ancillary agreements. These agreements constituted a\ntransaction whereby the Investors purchased $20.0 million in Secured Notes (the \"Secured Notes\") from the Operating Partnership.\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company satisfied and paid in full the Secured Notes.\nF-15\nOn November 30, 2021, Raleigh Hotel Associates, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of the Company,\nentered into a real estate sale agreement to sell the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh-Brownstone University hotel located in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina to CS Acquisition Vehicle, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, for a purchase price of $42.0 million.\nOn December 13, 2021, Louisville Hotel Associates, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of the\nCompany, entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the Sheraton Louisville Riverside hotel located in Jeffersonville, Indiana\nto Riverside Hotel, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company, for a purchase price of $11.5 million, including the assumption by the\nbuyer of the mortgage loan on the hotel. On February 10, 2022, the Company closed the sale of the Sheraton Louisville Riverside\nhotel. There were no net proceeds from the sale.\nOn June 10, 2022, we closed the sale of the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh-Brownstone University hotel. The Company used\napproximately $18.6 million of the net cash proceeds from the sale of the hotel to repay the existing mortgage on the property and\napproximately $19.8 million of the net cash proceeds to repay a portion of the Secured Notes with the Investors as required by the\nterms of the Secured Notes. The Company used the remaining net cash proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Investors\nreceived approximately $19.8 million of the proceeds from the sale of the hotel, of which approximately $13.3 million was applied\ntoward principal, approximately $6.3 million was applied toward the exit fee owed under the Secured Notes, and approximately $0.2\nmillion was applied toward accrued interest. Additionally, the terms of the Secured Notes allowed for the release of a portion of the\ninterest reserves in the amount of approximately $1.6 million, of which approximately $1.1 million was applied toward principal and\napproximately $0.5 million was applied toward the exit fee.\nOn June 28, 2022, affiliates of the Company entered into amended loan documents to modify the existing mortgage loan on the\nHotel Alba Tampa with the existing lender, Fifth Third Bank. Pursuant to the amended loan documents, the amended mortgage loan:\n(i) has an increased principal balance of $25.0 million; (ii) includes an extended maturity date of June 30, 2025, which may be further\nextended for two additional periods of one year each, subject to certain conditions; (iii) bears a floating interest rate of SOFR plus\n2.75%, subject to a floor rate of 2.75%; (iv) amortizes on a 25-year schedule and requires payments of monthly interest plus $40,600\nmonthly amortization payments; and (v) is guaranteed by the Operating Partnership up to $12.5 million, with the guaranty reducing to\n$6.25 million upon the successful achievement of certain performance milestones.\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company used the proceeds from the refinance of the Hotel Alba Tampa, along with approximately $0.2\nmillion of cash on hand as well as the balance of the interest reserve under the Secured Notes of approximately $0.5 million, to satisfy\nand pay in full the Secured Notes. The Investors received approximately $8.3 million in satisfaction of the Secured Notes, of which\napproximately $5.6 million was applied toward principal, approximately $2.6 million was applied toward the exit fee owed under the\nSecured Notes, and approximately $0.02 million was applied toward accrued interest. Concurrent with the cancellation of the Secured\nNotes, the following agreements were also terminated in accordance with their terms: (i) Note Purchase Agreement; (ii) Pledge and\nSecurity Agreement; (iii) Board Observer Agreement; and (iv) other related ancillary agreements.\nFrom June 21, 2021 through August 24, 2022, the Company entered into various privately-negotiated share exchange\nagreements with holders of its Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, in reliance on Section\n3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. Pursuant to those share exchange agreements, the Company has exchanged an aggregate of 3,0393,995\nshares of its common stock for 145,900 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, 208,500 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, and\n36,900 shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, together with all of the holder’s rights to receive accrued and unpaid dividends on those\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock. The common stock was issued in reliance\non the exemption from registration set forth in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, as amended, for securities exchanged by an issuer\nwith an existing security holder in a transaction where no commission or other remuneration was be paid or given directly or indirectly\nfor soliciting such an exchange.\nOn February 26, 2023, the Company entered into amended loan documents to modify the mortgage loan on The Whitehall hotel\nlocated in Houston, TX with the lender, International Bank of Commerce. The amendment (i) extends the maturity date to February\n26, 2028; (ii) maintains a floating interest rate of New York Prime Rate plus 1.25%; and (iii) subjects the interest rate to a floor rate of\n7.50%. The mortgage loan continues to be guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. The amendment also required us to establish a\nreal estate tax reserve as well as a debt service reserve that approximates the aggregate amount of one year's debt service, which was\ninitially established at approximately $1.5 million.\nOn March 14, 2023, the Company entered into amended loan documents to modify the mortgage loan on the DoubleTree by\nHilton Philadelphia Airport with the lender, TD Bank, N.A. The amendment provided a waiver for non-compliance with financial\ncovenants for the periods ended September 30 and December 31, 2022, modified the reference rate replacing 1-month LIBOR with\nSOFR and required us to establish a debt service coverage reserve of $0.3 million.\nF-16\nOn May 4, 2023, affiliates of the Company entered into loan documents to secure a $10.0 million mortgage loan on the\nDoubleTree by Hilton Laurel hotel located in Laurel, MD with Citi Real Estate Funding Inc. Pursuant to the loan documents, the\nmortgage loan: (i) has a principal balance of $10.0 million; (ii) has a maturity date of May 6, 2028; (iii) carries a fixed interest rate of\n7.35%; (iv) requires payments of interest only; (v) cannot be prepaid until the last 4 months of the loan term; and (vi) contains\ncustomary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default for a mortgage loan.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation – The consolidated financial statements of the Company presented herein include all the accounts of\nSotherly Hotels Inc., the Operating Partnership and the MHI TRS Entities. All significant inter-company balances and transactions\nhave been eliminated. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary\nfor a fair presentation have been included.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership presented herein include all the accounts of Sotherly Hotels\nLP and the MHI TRS Entities. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. Additionally, all\nadministrative expenses of the Company and those expenditures made by the Company on behalf of the Operating Partnership are\nreflected as the administrative expenses, expenditures and obligations thereto of the Operating Partnership, pursuant to the terms of the\nPartnership Agreement.\nVariable Interest Entities – The Operating Partnership is a variable interest entity. The Company’s only significant asset is its\ninvestment in the Operating Partnership, and consequently, substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities represent those\nassets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. All of the Company’s debt is an obligation of the Operating\nPartnership and its subsidiaries.\nInvestment in Hotel Properties – Investments in hotel properties include investments in operating properties which are recorded\nat fair value on the acquisition date and allocated to land, property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. Replacements and\nimprovements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Upon the sale or retirement of a fixed asset,\nthe cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the\nstatements of operations. Expenditures under a renovation project, which constitute additions or improvements that extend the life of\nthe property, are capitalized.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 7 to 39 years for\nbuildings and building improvements and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized\nover the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets.\nThe Company assesses the carrying values of its investments in hotel properties whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may cause a review\ninclude, but are not limited to, adverse permanent changes in the demand for lodging at the properties due to declining national or\nlocal economic conditions and/or new hotel construction in markets where the hotels are located. When such conditions exist,\nmanagement performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from\nthe ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceeds its carrying value. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are found to be\nless than the carrying amount of the asset, an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel property’s estimated fair\nmarket value would be recorded and an impairment loss recognized.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on the lodging and hospitality industries, which the Company considered to be\na triggering event for each of its hotels during its impairment testing for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company assessed\nthe recoverability of each of its hotel properties which included a projection of future operating cash flows based upon significant\nassumptions regarding its ability to maintain ownership of the property, growth rates, occupancy, room rates, economic trends,\nproperty-specific operating costs, an allowance for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment and projected cash flows from\nthe eventual disposition of the hotel. The Company also projected cash flows assuming an eventual disposition of the hotel based\nupon property-specific capitalization rates. As of December 31, 2021, the Company determined the Sheraton Louisville Riverside, to\nbe impaired based on the proceeds received in a subsequent sale, as well as The Whitehall in Houston, Texas due to the lack of\ncertainty regarding our ability to extend or refinance the mortgage which was set to mature in early 2023. The Company recognized an\nimpairment loss of approximately $12.2 million during the period ended December 31, 2021. The impairment loss was determined\nusing level 2 inputs under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. No impairment loss was recognized for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAssets Held for Sale – The Company records assets as held for sale when management has committed to a plan to sell the assets,\nactively seeks a buyer for the assets, and the consummation of the sale is considered probable and is expected within one year. When\nF-17\nthe carrying value of the asset is greater than the fair value, the Company reduces the carrying value to fair value less selling costs and\nrecognizes an impairment loss.\nCash and Cash Equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or\nless to be cash equivalents.\nConcentration of Credit Risk – The Company holds cash accounts at several institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) protection limits of $250,000. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of the failure of these\ninstitutions is represented by the difference between the FDIC protection limit and the total amounts on deposit. Management\nmonitors, on a regular basis, the financial condition of the financial institutions along with the balances there on deposit to minimize\nour potential risk.\nRestricted Cash – Restricted cash includes real estate tax escrows, insurance escrows and reserves for replacements of furniture,\nfixtures and equipment pursuant to certain requirements in our various mortgage agreements.\nAccounts Receivable – Accounts receivable consists primarily of hotel guests, banqueting and credit card receivables. Ongoing\nevaluations of collectability are performed and an allowance for potential credit losses is provided against the portion of accounts\nreceivable that is estimated to be uncollectible.\nInventories – Inventories, consisting primarily of food and beverages, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with\ncost determined on a method that approximates first-in, first-out basis.\nFranchise License Fees – Fees expended to obtain or renew a franchise license are amortized over the life of the license or\nrenewal. The unamortized franchise fees as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, were approximately $195,988 and $241,038,\nrespectively. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, was $45,050, $48,852 and $59,482,\nrespectively.\nDeferred Financing Costs – Deferred financing costs are recorded at cost and consist of loan fees and other costs incurred in\nissuing debt and are reflected in mortgage loans, net and unsecured notes, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred offering\ncosts are recorded at cost and consist of offering fees and other costs incurred in advance of issuing equity and are reflected in prepaid\nexpenses, inventory and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of deferred financing costs is computed using a\nmethod that approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt and is included in interest expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nDerivative Instruments – Our derivative instruments are reflected as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and\nmeasured at fair value. Derivative instruments used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm\ncommitment attributable to a particular risk, such as an interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivative instruments used\nto hedge exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow\nhedges. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value each period is reported in accumulated\nother comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and partners’ capital to the extent the hedge is effective. For a derivative\ninstrument designated as a fair value hedge, the change in fair value each period is reported in earnings along with the change in fair\nvalue of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting\nor is not designated as a hedge, the change in fair value each period is reported in earnings.\nWe use derivative instruments to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest-rate movements. To\naccomplish this objective, we currently use interest rate caps and an interest rate swap which act as cash flow hedges and are not\ndesignated as hedges. We value our interest-rate caps and interest rate swap at fair value, which we define as the price that would be\nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date\n(exit price). We do not enter into contracts to purchase or sell derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nFair Value Measurements –\nWe classify the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nF-18\nLevel 2 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or\nliability.\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nWe endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in\ntheir entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table represents our\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value and the basis for that measurement (our interest rate caps and interest rate swap are the\nonly assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, there were two non-recurring or infrequent asset valuations and no\nnon-recurring liabilities for fair value measurements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively):\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDecember 31, 2022\nInterest rate swaps (1) $ — $ 1,308,503 $ —\nMortgage loans (2) $ — $ (306,300,855) $ —\nDecember 31, 2023\nInterest rate swap (1) $ — $ 627,676 $ —\nMortgage loans (2) $ — $ (303,949,790) $ —\n(1) Interest rate swaps, one of which swaps the Loan Rate for a fixed interest rate of 5.237% for the DoubleTree by Hilton\nPhiladelphia Airport mortgage and is valued only at December 31, 2022, and the other which swaps the Loan Rate for a fixed\nrate of 5.576% for the Hotel Alba Tampa mortgage and is valued at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Notional\namounts of the swaps approximate the declining balance of the loan.\n(2) Mortgage loans had a carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of $315,989,194 and $320,482,103, as of December\n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nNoncontrolling Interest in Operating Partnership – Certain hotel properties have been acquired, in part, by the Operating\nPartnership through the issuance of limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The noncontrolling interest in the Operating\nPartnership is: (i) increased or decreased by the limited partners’ pro-rata share of the Operating Partnership’s net income or net loss,\nrespectively; (ii) decreased by distributions; (iii) decreased by redemption of partnership units for the Company’s common stock; and\n(iv) adjusted to equal the net equity of the Operating Partnership multiplied by the limited partners’ ownership percentage immediately\nafter each issuance of units of the Operating Partnership and/or the Company’s common stock through an adjustment to additional\npaid-in capital. Net income or net loss is allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership based on the weighted\naverage percentage ownership throughout the period.\nRevenue Recognition – Revenue consists of amounts derived from hotel operations, including the sales of rooms, food and\nbeverage, and other ancillary services. Room revenue is recognized over a customer’s hotel stay. Revenue from food and beverage and\nother ancillary services is generated when a customer chooses to purchase goods or services separately from a hotel room and revenue\nis recognized on these distinct goods and services at the point in time or over the time period that goods or services are provided to the\ncustomer. Some contracts for rooms or food and beverage services require an upfront deposit which is recorded as advanced deposits\n(or contract liabilities) shown on our consolidated balance sheets and recognized once the performance obligations are satisfied.\nCertain ancillary services are provided by third parties and the Company assessed whether it is the principal or agent in these\narrangements. If the Company is the agent, revenue is recognized based upon the gross commission earned from the third party. If\nthe Company is the principal, the Company recognizes based upon the gross sales price. With respect to the hotel condominium rental\nprograms the Company operates at the Hyde Resort & Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences, the Company has\ndetermined that it is an agent and recognizes revenue based on its share of revenue earned under the rental agency agreement.\nCertain of the Company’s hotels have retail spaces, restaurants or other spaces which the Company leases to third parties. Lease\nrevenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease and included in other operating revenues in the Company’s\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company collects revenue, sales taxes, use taxes, occupancy taxes and similar taxes at its hotels which are reflected in\nrevenue on a net basis on the consolidated statements of operations.\nF-19\nLease Revenue – Several of our properties generate revenue from leasing commercial space adjacent to the hotel, the restaurant\nspace within the hotel, portions of our parking facilities, apartment units and space on the roofs of our hotels for antennas and satellite\ndishes. We account for the lease income as revenue from other operating departments within the consolidated statement of operations\npursuant to the terms of each lease. Lease revenue was approximately $1.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nA schedule of minimum future lease payments receivable for the following twelve-month periods is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024 805,327\nDecember 31, 2025 1,297,801\nDecember 31, 2026 715,115\nDecember 31, 2027 703,515\nDecember 31, 2028 713,298\nDecember 31, 2029 and thereafter 8,930,834\nTotal $ 13,165,890\nLessee Accounting – The Company’s operating lease agreements primarily include the ground lease on the Hyatt Centric\nArlington, the parking garage lease in Hollywood, Florida at the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences, and the corporate office\nlease. The assets are classified as “right of use assets”, which represent our right to use an underlying asset and the operating lease\nliability, which represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, is classified within “accounts payable and\nother accrued liabilities”. Right of use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the\npresent value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the right of use assets and operating\nlease liabilities are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. As our leases do not provide an\nimplicit financing rate, we use our incremental borrowing cost based on information available at the commencement date using our\nactual borrowing rates commensurate with the lease terms and fully levered borrowing to determine present value. Extension options\non our leases are included in our minimum lease terms when they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nIncome Taxes – The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax. The MHI TRS Entities, which\nleases our hotels from subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, are subject to federal and state income taxes.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized\nfor the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if, based on all available evidence, it\nis “more-likely-than-not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will or will not be realized due to the inability to generate\nsufficient taxable income in certain financial statement periods. The “more-likely-than-not” analysis means the likelihood of\nrealization is greater than 50%, that we either will or will not be able to fully utilize the deferred tax assets against future taxable\nincome. The net amount of deferred tax assets that are recorded on the financial statements must reflect the tax benefits that are\nexpected to be realized using these criteria. As of December 31, 2023, we determined that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not\nbe able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets for future tax consequences; therefore, a 100% valuation allowance is required.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had no uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to\nuncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023, the tax years that remain subject to examination by the major\ntax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject generally include 2011 through 2022. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, the tax\nyears that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which the MHI TRS Entities are subject, because of open\nNOL carryforwards, generally include 2014 through 2022.\nThe Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as the unit holders of the Partnership are\nsubject to tax on their respective shares of the Partnership’s taxable income.\nStock-based Compensation – The Company’s 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), which the Company’s\nstockholders approved in April 2013, permitted the grant of stock options, restricted stock and performance share compensation\nawards to its employees and directors for up to 750,000 shares of common stock. In April 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved\nthe 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”) which permits similar compensation awards as the 2013 Plan to its employees\nand directors for up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock. The Company believes that stock awards align the interests of its\nemployees with those of its stockholders. The value of the awards is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over\nthe vesting or service period based on the value of the award as determined by the Company’s stock price on the date of grant or\nissuance.\nF-20\nUnder the 2013 Plan, the Company made cumulative stock awards totaling 745,160 shares, of which 316,333 were originally\nrestricted. As of December 31, 2023, there were 45,000 restricted shares to certain executives and directors, and 700,160 non-\nrestricted shares issued to certain executives, directors and employees. All awards have vested except for 45,000 shares issued to\ncertain executives, which will vest on December 31, 2024. The remaining 4,840 shares have been deregistered.\nUnder the 2022 Plan, the Company has made cumulative stock awards totaling 451,668 shares, of which 220,000 were\noriginally restricted. As of December 31, 2023, there were 164,000 restricted shares and 287,668 non-restricted shares.\nTotal stock-based compensation cost recognized under the 2013 Plan and 2022 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021 was $373,579, $871,466 and $517,546, respectively. No performance-based stock awards have been granted.\nConsequently, stock-based compensation as determined under the fair-value method would be the same under the intrinsic-value\nmethod.\nAdditionally, the Company sponsors and maintains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) and related trust for the\nbenefit of its eligible employees. We reflect unearned ESOP shares as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. Dividends on unearned\nESOP shares, when paid, are considered compensation expense. The Company recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair\nvalue of the Company’s ESOP shares during the periods in which they are committed to be released. For the years ended December\n31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 the ESOP compensation cost was $171,896, $126,958 and $172,000, respectively. To the extent that the fair\nvalue of the Company’s ESOP shares differs from the cost of such shares, the differential is recognized as the change in additional\npaid-in capital. Because the ESOP is internally leveraged through a loan from the Company to the ESOP, the loan receivable by the\nCompany from the ESOP is not reported as an asset nor is the debt of the ESOP shown as a liability in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nAdvertising – Advertising costs, including digital advertising, were approximately $2.7 million, $2.2 million and $2.0 million,\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively and are expensed as incurred.\nBusiness Interruption Proceeds – Insurance recoveries for business interruption were recognized during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, for $230,256, $62,010, and $200,000, respectively. The insurance proceeds were reflected in\nthe statement of operations in other operating departments revenues.\nInvoluntary Conversion of Assets – The Company record gains or losses on involuntary conversions of assets due to recovered\ninsurance proceeds to the extent the undepreciated cost of a nonmonetary asset differs from the amount of monetary proceeds\nreceived. During the years ending December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recognized approximately $1.4 million, $1.8 million and\n$0.6 million, respectively, for gain on involuntary conversion of assets, which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nComprehensive Income (Loss) – Comprehensive income (loss), as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a\nperiod from non-owner sources. The Company does not have any items of comprehensive income (loss) other than net income (loss).\nSegment Information – The Company has determined that our business is conducted in one reportable segment: hotel ownership.\nUse of Estimates – The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements – In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments -Credit Losses (Topic\n326), which replaced the existing \"incurred loss\" approach with an \"expected loss\" model for financial instruments measured at\namortized cost. For trade and other receivables, the forward-looking \"expected loss\" model will generally result in the earlier\nrecognition of allowances for losses. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses, which clarified that operating lease receivables accounted for under ASC 842 are not in the\nscope of ASU 2016-13. We have adopted this standard and there is no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform – Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting, which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the existing guidance on contract\nmodifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”). The update provides guidance in accounting for changes in contracts, hedging relationships, and other\ntransactions as a result of this reference rate reform. The option expedients and exceptions contained within this update, in general,\nF-21\nonly apply to contract amendments and modifications entered into prior to January 1, 2023. The provisions of this update will most\nlikely affect our financial reporting process relating to modifications of contracts with lenders and the hedging contracts associated\nwith each respective modified borrowing contract. In general, the provision of the update would benefit us by allowing modifications\nof debt contracts with lenders that fall under the guidance of ASC Topic 470 to be accounted for as a non-substantial modification and\nnot be considered debt extinguishment. As of December 31, 2023, we have not entered into any contract modification as it directly\nrelates to reference rate reform, with the exception of a modification to the mortgages on The Whitehall in Houston, Texas, which\nchanged the reference rate from LIBOR to the New York Prime Rate, and on Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection in Tampa,\nFlorida, which changed the reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR. On March 14, 2023, the Company modified the floating-rate\nmortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport to change the reference rate from 1-month LIBOR to SOFR. The\nCompany anticipates no additional loan modifications will be required.\n3.

On August 13, 2018, we entered into a swap agreement to fix the rate at 5.237% through July 31,\n2023. Notional amounts under the swap agreement approximated the declining balance of the loan. Effective October 29, 2023, the loan agreement was\namended to increase the interest rate to SOFR plus 3.50%.

On July 11, 2022, we\nentered into a swap agreement to fix the rate at 5.576%. The swap agreement reflects notional amounts approximate to the declining balance of the loan. See\nNote 14 – Subsequent Events for a description of the refinance of the mortgage on February 7, 2024.\nF-22\n(8) The note amortizes on a 25-year schedule after an initial interest-only period of one year and is subject to a pre-payment penalty except for any pre-payments\nmade within 120 days of the maturity date.\n(9) Following a 5-year lockout, the note can be prepaid with penalty in years 6-10 and without penalty during the final 4 months of the term.\n(10) The note bears a floating interest rate of New York Prime Rate plus 1.25%, with a floor of 7.50%.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, current on all loan payments and not otherwise in\ndefault under any of our mortgage loans, with the exception of a covenant default under the mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton\nPhiladelphia Airport. We anticipate a further modification of the loan agreement to include a waiver of non-compliance with the\nfinancial covenants as well as other terms and conditions, including a further extension of the maturity date. Additionally, the\nmortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront matures in July 2024. We intend to refinance that mortgage at the\nexpected level of its indebtedness prior to maturity.\nTotal future mortgage debt maturities, including with respect to any extensions of loan maturity, as of December 31, 2023 were\nas follows:\nFor the remaining twelve months ended December 31, 2024 $ 76,985,060\nDecember 31, 2025 116,059,350\nDecember 31, 2026 58,588,970\nDecember 31, 2027 1,757,220\nDecember 31, 2028 and thereafter 63,963,689\nTotal future maturities 317,354,289\nPPP Loans. Between April 16 and May 6, 2020, the Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries received proceeds of\nthree separate PPP Loans administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration pursuant to the CARES Act totaling approximately\n$10.7 million. Each PPP Loan had an initial term of two years with the ability to extend the loan to five years, if not forgiven and\ncarries an interest rate of 1.00%. Equal payments of principal and interest were to begin no later than 10 months following origination\nof the loan and are amortized over the remaining term of the loan. Pursuant to the terms of the CARES Act, the proceeds of each PPP\nLoan may be used for payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent or utility costs. The promissory note for each PPP Loan contains\ncustomary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults and breach of representations and warranties or of\nprovisions of the relevant promissory note.\nUnder the terms of the CARES Act, each borrower could apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the PPP\nLoan, which is determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act.\nOn December 9, 2022, the Company was notified it had received principal debt forgiveness in the amount of approximately $4.6\nmillion. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company received principal debt forgiveness totaling approximately $0.3 million\nand $4.7 million, respectively. No assurance is provided that the Company will obtain forgiveness under any relevant PPP Loan in\nwhole or in part. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had principal balances outstanding which totaled approximately\n$1.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nSecured Notes Financing. On December 31, 2020, we entered into a transaction whereby certain investors purchased $20.0\nmillion in Secured Notes from the Operating Partnership.\nOn June 10, 2022, the Company used the proceeds from the sale of the Doubletree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University\nhotel to partially repay the Secured Notes. The Investors received approximately $19.8 million of the proceeds from the sale of the\nhotel, of which approximately $13.3 million was applied toward principal, approximately $6.3 million was applied toward the exit fee\nowed under the Secured Notes, and approximately $0.2 million was applied toward accrued interest. Additionally, the terms of the\nSecured Notes allowed for the release of a portion of the interest reserves in the amount of approximately $1.6 million, of which\napproximately $1.1 million was applied toward principal and approximately $0.5 million was applied toward the exit fee.\nOn June 29, 2022, the Company used the proceeds from the refinance of the Hotel Alba Tampa, along with approximately $0.2\nmillion of cash on hand as well as the balance of the interest reserve under the Secured Notes of approximately $0.5 million, to satisfy\nand pay in full the Secured Notes. The Investors received approximately $8.3 million in satisfaction of the Secured Notes, of which\napproximately $5.6 million was applied toward principal, approximately $2.6 million was applied toward the exit fee owed under the\nSecured Notes, and approximately $0.1 million was applied toward accrued interest. Concurrent with the cancellation of the Secured\nNotes, the following agreements were also terminated in accordance with their terms: (i) Note Purchase Agreement; (ii) Pledge and\nSecurity Agreement; (iii) Board Observer Agreement; and (iv) other related ancillary agreements.\nF-23\n5. Commitments and Contingencies\nGround, Building and Submerged Land Leases – We lease 2,086 square feet of commercial space next to The DeSoto for use as\nan office, retail or conference space, or for any related or ancillary purposes for the hotel and/or atrium space. In December 2007, we\nsigned an amendment to the lease to include rights to the outdoor esplanade adjacent to the leased commercial space. The areas are\nleased under a six-year operating lease, which expired October 31, 2006 and has been renewed for the fourth of five optional five-year\nrenewal periods expiring October 31, 2026. Rent expense for this operating lease for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021, were each $83,932, respectively.\nWe lease, as landlord, the entire fourteenth floor of the Savannah hotel property to The Chatham Club, Inc. under a ninety-nine-\nyear lease expiring July 31, 2086. This lease was assumed upon the purchase of the building under the terms and conditions agreed to\nby the previous owner of the property. No rental income is recognized under the terms of this lease as the original lump sum rent\npayment of $990 was received by the previous owner and not prorated over the life of the lease.\nWe lease land adjacent to the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton for use as parking under a five-year renewable\nagreement with the Florida Department of Transportation that commenced in July 2019 and expires in July 2024. The agreement\nrequires annual payments of $2,432, plus tax, and may be renewed for an additional five years. Rent expense for each of the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, were $2,602, $2,608 and $2,575, respectively.\nWe lease approximately 8,500 square feet of commercial office space in Williamsburg, Virginia under an agreement with a ten-\nyear term beginning January 1, 2020. The initial annual rent under the agreement is $218,875, with the rent for each successive\nannual period increasing by 3.0% over the prior annual period’s rent. The annual rent was offset by a tenant improvement allowance\nof $200,000, that was applied against one-half of each monthly rent payment until the tenant improvement allowance was exhausted in\n2021. In December 2023, we received a rent concession of $257,731 against accrued and unpaid rents as well as a reduction of future\nlease payments by one-third. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, were ($85,759), $223,607 and\n223,607, respectively.\nWe lease the land underlying all of the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel pursuant to a ground lease. The ground lease requires us to\nmake rental payments of $50,000 per year in base rent and percentage rent equal to 3.5% of gross room revenue in excess of certain\nthresholds, as defined in the ground lease agreement. The initial term of the ground lease expires in 2025. We have exercised our\noption on the first of five renewal periods of 10 years each. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nwere $641,147, $501,042 and $232,588, respectively.\nWe entered into a 20-year parking and cabana management agreement for the parking garage and poolside cabanas associated\nwith the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences.

However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they\nwill be realizable based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversal of taxable temporary differences, projected\ntaxable income and tax planning strategies.\nDue to the uncertainty of realizing the loss in future years attributable to the changes in travel demand and market conditions in\nvarious markets in which the Company does business and the effectiveness of the Company’s tax planning strategies, as of December\n31, 2023, the Company believes it is not more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these assets. Therefore, the\nCompany has determined that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against the deferred tax asset. The amount of the deferred\ntax assets considered unrealizable, however, could change in the future based on revised estimates of future taxable income during the\ncarryforward period.\nThe significant components of our deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\nYear Ended Year Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nDeferred tax asset:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 12,437,085 $ 10,744,121 $ 14,287,318\nAccrued compensation 362,898 425,575 338,033\nAccrued expenses and other 192,266 — 247,037\nIntangible assets 1,275 10,092 28,627\nLess: Valuation allowance (12,993,524) (11,179,788) (14,901,015)\nTotal $ — $ — $ —\nF-32\n12. Earnings (Loss) per Share and per Unit\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share. The limited partners’ outstanding limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership (which may\nbe redeemed for common stock upon notice from the limited partner and following our election to redeem the units for stock rather\nthan cash) have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as there would be no effect on the amounts since the\nlimited partners’ share of income would also be added back to net loss. The shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred\nStock, and Series D Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Company,\nexcept upon the occurrence of a change of control and have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as there\nwould be no impact on the current controlling stockholders. The 247,043, 364,177 and 431,697 non-committed, unearned ESOP\nshares are treated as reducing the number of issued and outstanding common shares and similarly reducing the weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The effect of allocated\nand committed to be released shares during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, have not been included in the\nweighted average diluted earnings per share calculation, since there would be an anti-dilutive effect from the dilution by these shares,\nalthough the amount of compensation for allocated shares is reflected in net loss available to common stockholders for basic\ncomputation.\nThe computation of the Company’s basic net earnings (loss) per share is presented below:\nTwelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months\nEnded Ended Ended\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator\nNet (loss) income $ 3,809,711 $ 33,959,848 $ (28,539,640)\nLess: Net loss (income) allocated to participating share awards (49,118) (113,405)(1) — (1)\nNet loss (income) attributable to non-controlling interest 131,710 (1,423,327) 2,318,166\nUndeclared distributions to preferred stockholders (7,977,250) (7,634,219) (7,541,891)\nGain on extinguishment of preferred stock — 64,518 361,476\nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders for EPS\n$ (4,084,947) $ 24,853,415 $ (33,401,889)\ncomputation\nDenominator\nWeighted average number common shares outstanding for basic EPS\n18,843,032 17,802,772 15,531,684\ncomputation\nEffect of dilutive participating securities:\nUnvested restricted shares — (1) — (1) — (1)\nWeighted average number common and common equivalent shares\n18,843,032 17,802,772 15,531,684\noutstanding for diluted EPS computation\nBasic net (loss) income per common share:\nUndistributed (loss) income $ (0.22) $ 1.40 $ (2.15)\nTotal basic $ (0.22) $ 1.40 $ (2.15)\nDiluted net (loss) income per common share:\nUndistributed (loss) income $ (0.22) $ 1.40 $ (2.15)\nTotal diluted $ (0.22) $ 1.40 $ (2.15)\n(1) Anti-dilutive, therefore not included.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Unit.

(the “Company”, “Sotherly”, “we”, “us” or “our”), which is the sole general partner of Sotherly Hotels LP (the\n“Operating Partnership”), to be used at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders which will be held at Williamsburg Community\nBuilding, 401 North Boundary Street, Williamsburg, Virginia 23185, on Tuesday, April 30, 2024 at 9:00 a.m., local time (the “Annual\nMeeting”). The accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and this Proxy Statement are being mailed to stockholders\non or about March 27, 2024.\nAll properly executed written proxies that are delivered pursuant to this proxy statement will be voted on all matters that\nproperly come before the Annual Meeting for a vote. If your signed proxy specifies instructions with respect to matters being voted\nupon, your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If no instructions are specified, your shares will be voted (a)\n“FOR ALL” Proposal I (election of directors); (b) “FOR” Proposal II (ratification of the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm for fiscal year 2024); (c) “FOR” Proposal III (approval, on an advisory and non-binding basis, of the compensation of\nthe Company’s executive officers whose compensation is disclosed in this proxy statement (“Say-on-Pay”)); and (d) in the discretion\nof the proxy holders, as to any other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. Your proxy may be revoked at any\ntime prior to being voted by: (i) filing with the Company’s Corporate Secretary (Anthony E.

Voting by telephone,\nInternet or mail will not prevent you from later revoking that proxy and voting in person at the Annual Meeting.\nVOTING SECURITIES AND VOTE REQUIRED\nThe record date is the close of business on March 1, 2024 (the “Record Date”) for the determination of stockholders who are\nentitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. On the Record Date, there were 19,849,165 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock, $0.01 par value, outstanding. Each stockholder of record on the Record Date is entitled to one vote for each share\nheld.\nThe presence in person or by proxy of at least thirty-three and one-third percent of the outstanding shares of common stock\nentitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Shares represented by proxies received by the Company\nbut marked as abstentions, if any, will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the meeting.\nProxies received by the Company that reflect “broker non-votes” (i.e., proxies relating to shares held by brokers or other nominees as\nto which instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote such shares and with respect to\nwhich, on one or more but not all matters, the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power to vote such shares) will be\ncounted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. In the event\nthere are not sufficient votes for a quorum or to ratify any proposals at the time of the Annual Meeting, the Annual Meeting may be\nadjourned to another date, time or place, not later than 120 days after the original record date of March 1, 2024, without notice other\nthan announcement at the meeting, in order to permit the further solicitation of proxies.\nWe need your vote. Our stockholders are always encouraged to review the proxy materials and vote their shares. Under New\nYork Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) Rule 452, brokers who are voting with respect to shares held in street name have the discretion to\nvote such shares on routine matters but not on non-routine matters (so called “discretionary” matters), which include the election of\ndirectors and matters relating to executive compensation. For purposes of Proposals I and III, proxies received by the Company that\nreflect abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote,\nalthough they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.\nAs to the election of directors, the enclosed proxy enables a stockholder to vote “FOR ALL” the election of the nominees\nproposed by the Board, or to withhold authority to vote for the nominee being proposed. Directors are elected by a plurality of votes\nof the shares present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting and entitled to vote in the election of directors.\n1\nAs to the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm and the advisory vote to approve executive\ncompensation, which are submitted as Proposals II and III respectively, a stockholder may: (i) vote “FOR” the proposal; (ii) vote\n“AGAINST” the proposal; or (iii) “ABSTAIN” with respect to the proposal.\nUnless otherwise required by law, Proposal II shall be determined by a majority of votes cast affirmatively or negatively without\nregard to proxies marked “ABSTAIN” as to that matter. Unless otherwise required by law, Proposals III and all other matters, shall be\ndetermined by a majority of votes cast affirmatively or negatively without regard to (a) broker non-votes or (b) proxies marked\n“ABSTAIN” as to that matter.\nWhile the Board intends to carefully consider the stockholder votes resulting from Proposal III, the final vote will not be binding\non us and is advisory in nature. It will be up to our Nominating, Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee (the “NCGC\nCommittee”) and Board to determine whether and how to implement the vote on Proposal III.\n2\nPRINCIPAL HOLDERS\nThe following table sets forth the beneficial ownership, as of March 15, 2024, of (i) shares of the Company's common stock for\neach person or group known to us to be holding more than 5.0% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding, (ii) shares of\ncommon stock for each director and named executive officer, and (iii) for the directors and named executive officers of the Company\nas a group.

The Board has two (2) standing\ncommittees: the NCGC Committee and an Audit Committee. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Board held four\n(4) regular meetings and zero (0) special meetings. No incumbent director of the Company attended fewer than 75% of the total\nmeetings of the Board and committee meetings on which such Board member served during this period. All of the Company’s\ndirectors, except for directors Stein and Gibson, attended the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders either in person or\nvideophonically.\n8\nIndependent Directors\nAll of the members of the Audit Committee and the NCGC Committee and a majority of the Board must meet the test of\n“independence” as defined by the listing standards of the NASDAQ® Stock Market (\"NASDAQ\"). The NASDAQ standards provide\nthat to qualify as an “independent” director, in addition to satisfying certain bright-line criteria, the Board has a responsibility to make\nan affirmative determination that a director has no relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer\nof an organization that has a relationship with the Company) that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment. The\nBoard has determined that each of directors Caldwell, Gibson, Stein, Walker and Zinni, as well as director nominee Robertson,\nsatisfies the bright-line criteria and that none has a relationship with the Company that would interfere with such person’s ability to\nexercise independent judgment as a member of the Board. Therefore, we believe that each of such directors is independent under the\nNASDAQ rules.\nThe NCGC Committee is currently comprised of directors Stein, Walker and Zinni. Director Edward S. Stein is not standing for\nre-election to the board of directors and his term as director of the Company will expire at the conclusion of the 2024 Annual Meeting.\nThe Company anticipates that director nominee Walter S. Robertson III will begin serving on the NCGC Committee subject to his\nelection to the board of directors. All members of the NCGC Committee are independent in accordance with the listing standards of\nthe NASDAQ. This standing committee determines the salary for the Chairman of the Board, the President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and the General\nCounsel. The purpose of the NCGC Committee is to make recommendations to the Board regarding corporate governance policies\nand practices, recommend criteria for membership on the Board, make recommendations to the Board of potential director nominees,\nmake recommendations to the Board concerning the membership, size and responsibilities of each of the committees, develop general\npolicies relating to compensation and benefits, determine compensation for, and evaluate the performance of, our executive officers\nand administer our 2022 Plan. The NCGC Committee met one (1) time during fiscal year 2023. The NCGC Committee has adopted a\nwritten charter that was reviewed and approved on October 30, 2023 and sets forth the specific functions and responsibilities of the\ncommittee. The NCGC Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of its written charter on an annual basis. The NCGC\nCommittee charter is available on our website at www.sotherlyhotels.com.\nThe Audit Committee, a standing committee, is currently comprised of directors Gibson, Caldwell and Stein. The Board has\ndetermined that G. Scott Gibson, chairman of the Audit Committee, qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in\nItem 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. Director Edward S. Stein is not standing for re-election to the board of directors and his term as\ndirector of the Company will expire at the conclusion of the 2024 Annual Meeting. The Company anticipates that director nominee\nWalter S. Robertson III will begin serving on the Audit Committee subject to his election to the board of directors. All members of\nthe Audit Committee are independent in accordance with the listing standards of the NASDAQ. The Audit Committee meets with the\nCompany's independent registered public accounting firm to discuss the annual audit and any related matters. The Audit Committee is\nfurther responsible for internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee met eleven (11) times in fiscal year 2023. The\nAudit Committee has adopted a written charter that was reviewed and approved on October 30, 2023 and sets forth the specific\nfunctions and responsibilities of the committee. The Audit Committee charter is available on our website at www.sotherlyhotels.com.\nRisk Oversight\nThe Chief Financial Officer has responsibility for the day-to-day risk management functions of the Company and reports\ndirectly to the Audit Committee regarding issues related to risk management for the Audit Committee’s review and assessment. The\nAudit Committee meets with the Chief Financial Officer to review and discuss the Company’s risk management and related policies\nand procedures. The Audit Committee meets as often as and to the extent that the Audit Committee deems necessary or appropriate,\nbut at least annually in connection with the audit of each fiscal year’s financial statements.\nAdditionally, the charters of the Board’s committees delegate to the committees various elements of the Board’s risk oversight\nresponsibility. For example, our Audit Committee is responsible for periodically inquiring of management, our internal audit\nconsultants and the independent auditors about the Company’s major financial and operational risks or exposures (including cyber-\nrelated risks); discussing the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; and discussing guidelines and\npolicies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. Our NCGC Committee oversees risks associated with our corporate\ngovernance guidelines; our executive compensation plans and arrangements; and our code of business conduct, including compliance\nwith listing standards for independent directors, committee assignments and conflicts of interest. All these risks are discussed with the\nentire Board as often as and to the extent that the committees deem necessary or appropriate.\nReport of the Audit Committee\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Audit Committee: (i) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements\nwith management, (ii) discussed with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, FORVIS, LLP, all matters\nrequired to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) and the\n9\nCommission, and (iii) received the written disclosures and letter from FORVIS, LLP required by the applicable requirements of the\nPCAOB regarding FORVIS, LLP’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with\nFORVIS, LLP its independence. Based on the foregoing review and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board\nthat the audited financial statements be included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023 for filing with the Commission.\nAudit Committee:\nG. Scott Gibson IV - Chairman\nEdward S. Stein\nMaria L. Caldwell\nDirector Nomination Process\nThe Board is responsible for assembling for stockholder consideration a group of nominees that, taken together, have the\nexperience, qualifications, attributes and skills appropriate for functioning effectively as a board. The NCGC Committee works with\nthe Board to determine the appropriate characteristics, skills and experience for the Board as a whole and its individual members with\nthe objective of having a board with diverse backgrounds and experience and makes recommendations to the Board of potential\nnominees. When recommending candidates, the NCGC Committee assesses the Board’s size and composition; corporate governance\npolicies; applicable listing standards and laws; individual director performance, expertise and willingness to serve actively; the\nnumber of other public and private company boards on which a director candidate serves; consideration of director nominees proposed\nor recommended by stockholders and related policies and procedures; and other appropriate factors. Characteristics expected of all\ndirectors include integrity, high personal and professional ethics, strong professional reputation and record of achievement,\nconstructive and collegial personal attributes, sound business judgment and the ability and commitment to devote sufficient time and\nenergy to board service. There are no minimum qualifications that the NCGC Committee has established for a candidate\nrecommended to the Board by the NCGC Committee. The NCGC Committee does not have a diversity policy; however, the NCGC\nCommittee seeks to include on the Board a complementary mix of individuals with diverse backgrounds and skills reflecting the broad\nset of challenges that the Board confronts. In evaluating the suitability of individual Board members, the NCGC Committee takes into\naccount many factors, including general understanding of marketing and finance; understanding of our business; education and\nprofessional background; personal accomplishment; diversity of viewpoint; business expertise; and industry knowledge. The Board,\nthrough the NCGC Committee, evaluates each individual in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of recommending\na group that can best perpetuate the success of our business and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment\nusing its diversity of experience. The NCGC Committee evaluates each incumbent director to determine whether such person should\nbe nominated to stand for re-election, based on the types of criteria outlined above as well as the director’s contributions to the Board\nduring the current term.\n10\nIn recommending candidates to the Board, the NCGC Committee will consider nominees recommended by stockholders so long\nas the recommendation is submitted to our corporate secretary within the timeframe required to request a proposal that will be\nincluded in the proxy materials for our next annual meeting of stockholders. However, the NCGC Committee may, in its sole\ndiscretion, reject any such recommendation for any reason.\nAndrew M. Sims’ employment agreement with us provides that we must nominate him to serve as a director. The nomination\nright provided for under Andrew M. Sims’ employment agreement is subject to the determination of the NCGC Committee, in\nconnection with each annual or special meeting of stockholders at which directors will be elected, that the nominee satisfies the\nstandards established by the committee for service on the Board. If Andrew M. Sims fails to be nominated to our Board or is\ninvoluntarily removed from our Board, unless for cause or vote by the stockholders, he, David R. Folsom, and Anthony E. Domalski\neach will receive, among other things, a severance payment equal to three (3) times his respective combined salary base and actual\nbonus compensation for the preceding fiscal year. Andrew M. Sims is not independent under the corporate governance standards of\nthe NASDAQ.\nThe Board believes that its procedures comply with the requirements of the NASDAQ and provide adequate assurance that\nnominations are approved by independent directors.\nLeadership Structure\nOur Board remains committed to maintaining strong corporate governance and appropriate independent oversight of\nmanagement. The Board has given careful consideration to our Company’s leadership structure and has determined that our Company\nand our stockholders are best served by separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Currently, Andrew M. Sims\nserves as Chairman of the Board as an officer of the Company, and David R. Folsom serves as the Company’s President and Chief\nExecutive Officer. Mr. Sims, as Chairman, provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer; presides over meetings of the Board and\nsets the agenda for meetings of the Board; and advises the Company on strategic matters and major transactions, including\nacquisitions, dispositions, franchising and branding decisions, as well as capital market transactions. Mr. Folsom, as President and\nChief Executive Officer, manages the day-to-day operations of the Company and sets and implements the Company policy and\nstrategy established by the Board. Mr. Sims has significant experience as Chairman, including serving as the Chairman of the Board\nsince the Company’s initial public offering in 2004, and Mr. Folsom has significant experience as a senior executive, including\nserving as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer from 2006 until 2019 and its President since 2011. In the view of the Board, this\nstructure (i) ensures that the Board’s agenda reflects our strategic challenges and opportunities; (ii) ensures that the Board is presented\nwith information required for it to fulfill its responsibilities; (iii) ensures that Board meetings are as productive and effective as\npossible; (iv) promotes coordinated leadership and direction for the Board and executive management; and (v) allows for a clear focus\nfor the chain of command to execute the Company’s strategic initiatives and business plan. The Board believes that this leadership\nstructure is also appropriate given the size of the Company.\nThe Board and its committees oversee the effectiveness of management policies and decisions, including the execution of key\nstrategic initiatives. Each of the Board’s committees is composed entirely of independent directors. Consequently, independent\ndirectors directly oversee such critical matters as the compensation of executive management, including the compensation of Andrew\nM. Sims and David R. Folsom, the selection and evaluation of directors and the development and implementation of corporate\ngovernance programs. The independent directors conduct annual performance reviews of the Chairman and the Chief Executive\nOfficer, assessing the Company’s financial and non-financial performance and the quality and effectiveness of senior leadership. In\naddition, the NCGC Committee oversees the processes by which Andrew M. Sims and David R. Folsom are evaluated. The Board\nbelieves that the Company’s corporate governance documents, which are available on the Company’s website, help ensure that strong\nand independent directors will continue to play the central oversight role necessary to maintain the Company’s commitment to the\nhighest quality corporate governance. Pursuant to these governance principles, independent Board members meet as often as and to\nthe extent that the independent directors deem necessary or appropriate at executive sessions without management present.\nOur Board has designated Edward S. Stein, the chairman of the NCGC Committee, to serve as the lead independent director.\nDirector Stein is not standing for re-election to the board of directors and his term as director of the Company will expire at the\nconclusion of the 2024 Annual Meeting. The Company anticipates that director nominee Walter S. Robertson III will begin serving as\nchairman of the NCGC Committee and as lead independent director, subject to his election to the board of directors. The lead\nindependent director serves as chairman of meetings of the independent directors. The lead independent director, a separate and\nindependent position from the chairman, calls meetings, supervises the conduct of meetings of the independent directors, records the\nminutes and reports meeting results and any decisions of the independent directors to our chairman and facilitates communication\nbetween the independent directors, the chairman and management. The position currently held by Edward S. Stein ensures effective\ncorporate governance for our Company.\n11\nNCGC Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nThe NCGC Committee consists of Mr. Stein, Mr. Zinni, and Mr. Walker. None of the members of our NCGC Committee is or\nhas been one of our employees or officers. None of our executive officers currently serves, or during the past fiscal year has served,\nas a member of the Board or compensation committee of another entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board\nor our NCGC Committee.\nStockholder Communications\nThe Board does not have a formal process for stockholders to send communications to the Board. In view of the infrequency of\nstockholder communications to the Board, the Board does not believe that a formal process is necessary. Written communications\nreceived by our Company from stockholders are shared with the full Board no later than the next regularly scheduled Board meeting.\nThe Board encourages, but does not require, directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders.\nProhibition on Hedging\nOur insider trading policy prohibits the Company’s directors, officers, key employees and their respective family members from\ntrading any interest or position relating to the future price of Company securities, such as a put, call or short sale.\n12\nDIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nThe NCGC Committee is responsible for developing our policies relating to compensation and benefits, determining\ncompensation for, and evaluating the performance of, certain of our executive officers, and administering the 2022 Plan. The NCGC\nCommittee determines and approves compensation for our Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer, and approves compensation for\nour Chief Financial Officer as determined by our Chief Executive Officer. These three (3) individuals are our most highly paid\nexecutive officers and we refer to these three (3) executive officers as our named executive officers.\nThe NCGC Committee reviews and approves, at least annually, corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of\nthe Chairman and the CEO. The NCGC Committee also:\n• Evaluates at least annually the performance of the Company’s named executive officers in light of the corporate goals and\nobjectives;\n• At least annually, either as the NCGC Committee or together with the other independent directors, as directed by the\nBoard, in light of the corporate goals and objectives and the performance evaluations: (i) determines and approves the\ncompensation of the Chairman and the CEO, including individual elements of salary, bonus, supplemental retirement,\nincentive and equity compensation; and (ii) approves the compensation for the CFO and the COO based on\nrecommendations from the Chairman and the CEO;\n• Administers the Company’s incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans;\n• Reviews, as the NCGC Committee considers appropriate in setting named executive officer compensation, the Company’s\nperformance’s and relative stockholder return, compensation at comparable companies, past years’ compensation to the\nCompany’s named executive officers and other relevant factors; and\n• Reviews and approves all employment agreements and amendments, separation and severance agreements and other\ncompensatory contracts, arrangements, perquisites and payments with respect to the Chairman and CEO, and reviews and\nmakes recommendations to the Board regarding all such agreements, contracts, arrangements, perquisites and payments\nwith respect to other executive officers.\nIn any deliberations or voting to determine the compensation of the Chairman or the CEO, neither the Chairman nor the CEO\nmay be present; however, in any deliberations regarding the compensation of other executive officers, the NCGC Committee may\nelect to invite the Chairman or the CEO to be present but not vote.\nThe NCGC Committee’s principal objective in establishing compensation policies is to develop and administer a comprehensive\nprogram designed to attract and retain outstanding managers. The NCGC Committee’s guidelines for compensation of our named\nexecutive officers are designed to provide fair and competitive levels of total compensation while linking elements of compensation\nwith performance. A further objective of our compensation policies is to provide incentives and reward named executive officers for\ntheir contribution to our Company. To that end, the NCGC Committee believes executive compensation packages provided by us to\nthe named executive officers should include cash compensation that rewards performance as measured against established goals. The\nNCGC Committee takes into account our named executive officers’ existing ownership of the Company’s common stock and\nallocations of common stock made to the executives’ participant accounts pursuant to the Company’s ESOP, which the NCGC\nCommittee believes aligns the interests of our named executive officers with that of our stockholders and encourages a focus on long-\nterm value creation.\nIt was favorably noted by the NCGC Committee that our stockholders approved our executive compensation program at the\n2023 annual meeting. Holders of approximately 5.4 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 88.2% of the total votes\ncast (without regard to broker non-votes or abstentions), voted for the advisory vote approving executive compensation. The NCGC\nCommittee generally considered the results of the 2023 advisory vote on executive compensation and considered these voting results\nas supportive of the NCGC Committee’s general executive compensation practices.\nThe NCGC Committee has not retained or obtained the advice of a compensation consultant.\n13\nElements of our Compensation Plan\nElements of compensation for our named executive officers consist principally of base salary, cash performance bonuses, and\nnon-discretionary allocations pursuant to the Company’s ESOP. In determining each element of compensation for each named\nexecutive officer, the NCGC Committee primarily considers the following elements:\n• market data relating to an identified peer group;\n• third-party compensation surveys for the lodging industry and, when applicable, compensation at comparable companies;\n• company performance in light of specified goals and guidance and taking into account general market conditions;\n• recommendations of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer;\n• individual performance of the named executive officers;\n• the terms of each named executive officer’s employment agreement;\n• past years’ compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers; and\n• allocations to the named executive officer’s participant accounts pursuant to the Company’s ESOP.\nFor 2023, executive compensation included four main components: (i) annual base salary; (ii) cash bonus (iii) stock awards; and\n(iv) non-discretionary allocations pursuant to the Company’s ESOP.\n14\nPrinciples and Objective of the Compensation Plan\nThe following table summarizes the primary components and rationale of the Company’s compensation philosophy and the pay\nelements that support that philosophy.\nPhilosophy Component Rationale/Commentary Pay Element\nCompensation should be The principal objective of the Company’s executive All elements (salary, annual\ndesigned to attract and retain compensation plan has been and is to achieve the Company’s cash bonus, ESOP allocations,\noutstanding managers business objectives by attracting, retaining and motivating restricted stock awards, health\ntalented executive officers by providing incentives and economic and welfare benefits, change in\nsecurity. control severance agreements)\nCompensation should provide To attract and reduce the risk of losing the services of valuable All elements\nfair and competitive levels of executive officers but avoid the expense of excessive pay,\ntotal compensation compensation should be competitive. The NCGC Committee\nassesses the competitiveness of the Company's compensation to\nits executive officers by comparison to compensation of\nexecutive officers at similar public companies, based on available\nproxy statement data and other data, or by reviewing publicly\navailable third-party surveys to understand developments in\ncompensation in the lodging sector.\nElements of compensation Performance-based pay aligns the interest of management with Cash bonus/stock awards\nshould be linked with the Company’s stockholders. Performance-based compensation\nperformance motivates and rewards individual efforts and Company success.\nThe executive officers were historically eligible to receive a cash\nbonus in target amounts between 25%-35% of their base salary,\nsubject to consideration of the performance metrics described\nunder the heading “Cash Bonus Plan”.\nCompensation should align the The Company’s executive compensation is designed to reward Non-discretionary ESOP\ninterests of our executive favorable total stockholder returns, both in an absolute amount allocations, restricted stock\nofficers with those of our and relative to the Company’s peers, taking into consideration the awards\nstockholders Company’s competitive position within the real estate industry\nand each executive’s long-term contributions to the Company.\nThe NCGC Committee takes into account significant existing\nequity ownership positions of our named executive officers.\nCompensation should provide The Company strives to provide a rewarding and professionally All elements\nincentives and reward named challenging work environment for its executive officers. The\nexecutive officers for their Company believes that executive officers who are motivated and\ncontribution to our Company challenged by their duties are more likely to achieve the\nindividual and corporate performance goals. The Company’s\nexecutive compensation plan should reflect this work\nenvironment and reward the executive officers for meeting or\nexceeding performance expectations.\nBase Salary\nThe original base salary amounts of the named executive officers were provided for in their respective employment agreements\nand are subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of those agreements. In setting base salaries, and annually considering\nadjustments, the NCGC Committee uses an evaluation process considering the named executive officer’s position, level and scope of\nresponsibility and an evaluation of base salaries and other benefits of other executive officers of comparable companies, including an\nanalysis of our Company’s current operating results. The 2023 annual base salaries for the named executive officers are provided in\nthe Summary Compensation Table.\nFor 2024, the NCGC Committee approved annual base salaries for Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr. Domalski of $559,316,\n$553,723, and $394,160, respectively.\n15\nCash Bonus Plan\nUnder our employment agreements with the named executive officers, each named executive officer is eligible to receive a cash\nbonus in target amounts between 25%-35% of base salary. The NCGC Committee has reviewed these agreements and has determined\nin the best interests of the Company to structure a cash bonus plan that may award above or below the 25%-35% target range indicated\nin the agreements subject to consideration of the following:\n• stock performance relative to our Company peer group; and\n• realizing the 2023 corporate goals and objectives and other personal goals established by our Board based on\nrecommendations from our Chief Executive Officer.\nFor 2023, the NCGC Committee approved cash bonuses for Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr. Domalski of $95,000, $70,000, and\n$50,000, respectively. The NCGC Committee has determined that for 2024, the annual target bonus for which each of our named\nexecutive officers is eligible to receive will be an amount between 25%-35% of each such executive's base salary, pursuant to each\nexecutive's employment agreement.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan\nThe Company sponsors and maintains the Sotherly Hotels Inc. ESOP and related trust for the benefit of its eligible employees.\nEmployees who are at least 21 years old with at least one year of service during which the employee has completed at least 1,000\nhours of service with the Company are eligible to participate. On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement\nwith the ESOP pursuant to which the ESOP may borrow up to $5,000,000 from the Company to purchase shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock (“ESOP Loan”). Between January 3, 2017 and February 23, 2017, the ESOP purchased 682,500 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock in the open market. In accordance with the ESOP Loan documents, the common stock purchased by the\nESOP serves as collateral for the ESOP Loan. The ESOP Loan will be repaid principally from discretionary contributions by the\nCompany to the ESOP over a period ending no later than December 29, 2036. The interest rate on the ESOP Loan is 2.5% and the\nESOP Loan documents provide that the ESOP Loan may be repaid over a shorter period, without penalty for prepayments. Shares\npurchased by the ESOP are held in a suspense account for allocation among participants as contributions are made to the ESOP by the\nCompany.\nContributions to the ESOP and shares released from the suspense account in an amount proportional to the repayment of the\nESOP Loan will be allocated among ESOP participants on the basis of compensation in the year of allocation.

Each current executive will receive customary\nbenefits, including a term life insurance policy of $1.0 million and disability insurance in an amount so that each executive will\nreceive monthly payments equal to one-half of each executive’s monthly salary payment in the event of disability. As described\nbelow, the current employment agreements provide our executives with severance benefits if such executive’s employment ends under\ncertain circumstances including a change in control. We believe that the current employment agreements will benefit us by helping to\nretain Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr. Domalski and by allowing such executives to focus on their duties without the distraction of the\nconcern for their personal situation in the event of a possible change in control of our Company.\nOur current employment agreements with Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr. Domalski contain provisions providing for substantial\npayments to these executives in the event of a change of control of our Company. Specifically, if we terminate these executive’s\nemployment without cause or the executive resigns with good reason, which includes a failure to nominate Andrew M. Sims to our\nBoard or his involuntary removal from our Board, unless for cause or by vote of the stockholders, or if there is a change of control,\neach of these executives is entitled to the following:\n• any accrued but unpaid salary and bonuses;\n• vesting of any previously issued stock options or restricted stock;\n• payment of the executive’s life, health and disability insurance coverage for a period of five (5) years following\ntermination;\n• any unreimbursed expenses; and\n• a severance payment equal to three (3) times the executive’s combined salary and actual bonus compensation for the\npreceding fiscal year, to be paid within five (5) days of such executive officer’s last day of employment.\n20\nThe Folsom Employment Agreement also provides that the complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company constitutes a\nchange in control. In the event that the Company elects not to renew the Mr. Folsom’s employment agreement, Mr. Folsom is entitled\nto receive the following: (i) any accrued but unpaid salary and bonuses; (ii) a severance payment equal to Mr. Folsom’s combined\nsalary and actual bonus compensation for the preceding fiscal year, to be paid within five (5) days of Mr. Folsom’s last day of\nemployment; and (iii) payment of the full premium (including administrative fee) for continuing health insurance coverage under\nCOBRA or any similar state law for a period of two (2) years following the expiration of his employment agreement.\nThe NCGC Committee met on January 12, 2023 and determined to (i) extend the term of the employment agreements for each\nof our named executive officers until December 31, 2027 and (ii) provide the named executive officers with restricted stock awards, in\nrecognition for their performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n21\nTERMINATION PAYMENTS TABLE\nThe following table indicates the cash amounts, accelerated vesting and other payments and benefits that the named executive\nofficers would be entitled to receive under various circumstances pursuant to the terms of their respective employment agreements.\nThe table assumes that termination of the named executive officer from the Company under the scenario shown occurred on\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAcceleration\nof Vesting\nof Long-\nTerm Equity Excise\nCash Incentive Tax Other\nPayment(1) Awards Gross-Up Benefits Total\nName and Termination Scenario ($) ($) Payments ($) ($)\nAndrew M.

The annual total\ncompensation for fiscal year 2023 for our CEO was $815,069, and for the median employee was $355,547. The resulting ratio of our\nCEO’s pay to the pay of our median employee for fiscal year 2023 is 2.29 to 1.00. Our methodology for calculating the CEO pay ratio\nis explained below.\n• Employee Population. We determined that our employee population, as of December 31, 2023, consisted of eight full-\ntime employees, excluding our CEO.\n• Median Employee. We calculated the annual total compensation of each employee as of December 31, 2023 in\naccordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, then selected the median employee.\n• CEO Pay Ratio. We calculated our CEO's annual total compensation in the same manner as the median employee.\nFinally, we divided our CEO's annual total compensation by the median employee's total compensation to determine the\npay ratio.\nPay Versus Performance\nAs described in greater detail in “Director and Executive Compensation – Principles and Objective of the Compensation Plan,”\nthe Company’s executive compensation program reflects our commitment to aligning pay with performance. We provide a\ncompetitive total compensation package with payouts dependent upon the degree to which performance measures are met or exceeded.\nWe regularly review our performance measures to ensure that they provide a balanced assessment of overall Company performance.\nThe metrics that the Company uses for both our long-term and short-term incentive awards are selected based on an objective of\nincentivizing the Company’s named executive officers to increase value for our stockholders and not all of those metrics are presented\nin the Pay versus Performance table. Moreover, the Company generally seeks to incentivize long-term performance and therefore does\nnot specifically align the Company’s performance measures with compensation that is actually paid (as computed in accordance with\nItem 402(v) of Regulation S-K) for a particular year.\nYear Summary Compensation Average Average Value of Initial Net Income\nCompensation Actually Paid Summary Compensation Fixed $100\nTable Total to PEO(2) Compensation Actually Paid Investment Based\nfor PEO(1) Table for Non- to Non-PEO On\nPEO NEOs(1) NEOs(3) Total Shareholder\nReturn(4)\n2023 $815,069 $781,896 $747,145 $713,342 $59.60 $3,941,421\n2022 $731,818 $723,154 $628,542 $627,842 $72.40 $32,536,521\n2021 $732,552 $720,252 $603,997 $601,947 $83.60 $(26,221,474)\n(1) The CEO for 2021, 2022, and 2023 is David R.

The Company did not grant any stock option awards in 2023.\n24\nRisk Management Considerations\nThe NCGC Committee oversees risks associated with our executive compensation plans and arrangements. The Company does\nnot believe that the executive compensation plan is reasonably likely to cause a material adverse impact on the Company for several\nreasons. First, our named executive officers own significant amounts of common stock in the Company, and continue to receive\nadditional shares of common stock pursuant to the Company’s ESOP, which we believe aligns the interests of our executives with that\nof our stockholders and encourages a focus on long-term value creation. Second, we have historically offered cash incentive bonuses\nin targeted amounts of 25%-35% of base salary subject to the consideration of performance metrics that are designed to reflect\nbenefits to the Company. We have never granted stock options.\nImpact of Accounting and Tax Treatments of Compensation\nThe accounting and tax treatment of compensation generally has not been a factor in determining the amounts of compensation\nfor our executive officers. However, the NCGC Committee and management have considered the accounting and tax impact of\nvarious program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive.\nWhile an exception exists for certain contracts in place as of November 2, 2017, only the first $1 million in compensation paid\nto our named executive officers generally is deductible. Therefore, the NCGC Committee retains flexibility to provide compensation\nunder the plan to executives consistent with the Company’s compensation programs, even if such compensation would not be fully\ndeductible.\n25\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nThe following table sets forth the cash and non-cash compensation awarded to certain of our independent, non-employee\ndirectors for their service during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFees\nEarned\nor Paid Stock\nin Cash Awards Total\nName ($) ($) ($)\nMaria L.

To determine how\nappropriate the current level of compensation for our non-employee directors is, the NCGC Committee has historically obtained data\nfrom a number of different sources including publicly available data describing director compensation in peer companies.\nWe have resumed compensating our independent, non-employee directors for their services as directors through a mixture of\ncash and equity-based compensation. Eligible independent, non-employee directors receive annual compensation of $20,000, plus a\nfee of $750 (plus out-of-pocket expenses) for attendance in person at each meeting of the Board, and $750 for each committee meeting\nattended in person. Directors who attend meetings telephonically receive a fee of $375. Directors who are also officers or employees\nof our Company do not receive separate compensation for service as a director. Directors Edward S. Stein and G. Scott Gibson IV\neach receive an additional $6,500 per year for their services as chairs of the NCGC Committee and Audit Committee, respectively.\nOn an annual basis, the NCGC Committee awards restricted stock to certain independent, non-employee directors pursuant to\nthe 2022 Plan. On January 18, 2024, directors Caldwell, Gibson, Walker, and Zinni received an incentive stock award of 3,000 shares\nthat will vest on December 31, 2024. Also on January 18, 2024, director Stein received an incentive stock award of 750 shares that\nwill vest on April 30, 2024. On January 12, 2023, each of our independent directors received an incentive stock award of 3,000 shares\nthat became fully vested on December 31, 2023. Also on January 12, 2023, our independent directors received the following vested\nstock awards in lieu of cash compensation for service during 2022: (i) director Caldwell received a stock award of 7,014 shares; (ii)\ndirector Gibson received a stock award of 8,819 shares; (iii) director Stein received a stock award of 9,236 shares; (iv) director Walker\nreceived a stock award of 6,389 shares; and (v) director Zinni received a stock award of 6,389 shares. Although distributions are paid\non all restricted stock, whether or not vested, at the same rate and on the same date as on shares of our common stock, these holders\nwill be prohibited from selling such shares until they vest. To date, the stock awards to our independent directors have been restricted\nuntil the last day of the fiscal year in which they were granted, with the following exceptions: (i) the 2,250 unrestricted shares granted\nto Mr. Walker in 2016; (ii) the 2,250 unrestricted shares granted to Mr. Gibson in 2018; (iii) the 2,250 unrestricted shares granted to\nMs. Caldwell in 2020; and (iv) the stock awards in lieu of cash compensation as described above and reported in previous years.\n26\n2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nWe have established the 2022 Plan for the purpose of recruiting and retaining our and our affiliates’ executive officers,\nemployees, non-employee directors and consultants. The 2022 Plan authorizes the issuance of options to purchase shares of common\nstock and the grant of stock awards, deferred shares, performance shares and performance units.\nAdministration of the 2022 Plan is carried out by the NCGC Committee. The NCGC Committee may delegate a portion of its\nauthority under the 2022 Plan to one or more officers.\nOur officers and employees and those of our Operating Partnership and other subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the 2022\nPlan. Our non-employee directors, and other persons that provide consulting services to us and our subsidiaries, are also eligible to\nparticipate in the 2022 Plan.\n27\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn accordance with our Audit Committee charter and procedures established by the Audit Committee, our Audit Committee or\nanother independent body of our Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the terms and conditions of all related party\ntransactions. Any transaction, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which a director or executive officer of our\nCompany or a member of the immediate family of a director or officer has a direct or indirect material interest, would need to be\napproved by our Audit Committee or another independent body of our Board prior to our Company entering into such transaction.\nThe procedures for review and approval of certain relationships and related transactions are contained in our Audit Committee charter\nwhich is available on our website at www.sotherlyhotels.com.\nAll new related party transactions that were not previously approved were reviewed and approved by our Audit Committee or\nanother independent body of our Board in 2023, unless otherwise indicated.\nTransactions with Our Town Hospitality\nOur Town Hospitality, LLC (“Our Town”) is currently the management company for each of our ten wholly-owned hotels, as\nwell the manager of our rental programs at the Hyde Resort & Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences. As of\nMarch 15, 2024, an affiliate of Andrew M. Sims, our Chairman; an affiliate of David R. Folsom, our President and Chief Executive\nOfficer; and Andrew M. Sims Jr., our Vice President - Operations & Investor Relations, beneficially owned approximately 71.0%,\n7.0%, and 15.0%, respectively, of the total outstanding ownership interests of Our Town. Mr. Sims, Mr. Folsom, and Mr. Sims Jr.\nserve as directors of Our Town.\nManagement Agreements\nOn September 6, 2019, we entered into a master agreement with Our Town and the former majority equity holder of Our Town\nrelated to the management of certain of our hotels, as amended on December 13, 2019 (as amended, the “OTH Master Agreement”).\nOn December 13, 2019, and subsequent dates we entered into a series of individual hotel management agreements for the management\nof our hotels. The hotel management agreements for each of our ten wholly-owned hotels and the two rental programs are each\nreferred to as an “OTH Hotel Management Agreement” and, together, the “OTH Hotel Management Agreements”.\nThe OTH Master Agreement:\n• expires on March 31, 2035, or earlier if all of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements expire or are terminated prior to\nthat date. The OTH Master Agreement shall be extended beyond 2035 for such additional periods as an OTH Hotel\nManagement Agreement remains in effect;\n• requires Our Town to provide dedicated executive level support for our managed hotels pursuant to certain criteria;\n• sets an incentive management fee for each of the hotels managed by Our Town equal to 10% of the amount by which\ngross operating profit, as defined in the OTH Hotel Management Agreements, for a given year exceeds the budgeted gross\noperating profit for such year; provided, however, that the incentive management fee payable in respect of any such year\nshall not exceed 0.25% of the gross revenues of the hotel included in such calculation;\n• provides for an adjustment to the fees payable by us under the OTH Hotel Management Agreements in the event the net\noperating income of Our Town falls below $250,000 for any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2021;\n• provides a mechanism and establishes conditions on which the Company will offer Our Town the opportunity to manage\nhotels acquired by the Company in the future, pursuant to a negotiated form of single facility management agreement,\nwith the caveat that the Company is not required to offer the management of future hotels to Our Town; and\n• sets a base management fee for future hotels of 2.00% for the first year of the term, 2.25% for the second year of the term,\nand 2.50% for the third and any additional years of the term.\n28\nEach of the OTH Hotel Management Agreements has an initial term ending March 31, 2035. Each of the OTH Hotel\nManagement Agreements may be extended for up to two additional periods of five years subject to the approval of both parties with\nrespect to any such extension. The agreements provide that Our Town will be the sole and exclusive manager of the hotels as the\nagent of the respective TRS Lessee, at the sole cost and expense of the TRS Lessee, and subject to certain operating standards. Each\nOTH Hotel Management Agreement may be terminated in connection with a sale of the related hotel. In connection with a\ntermination upon the sale of the hotel, Our Town will be entitled to receive a termination fee equal to the lesser of the management fee\npaid with respect to the prior twelve months or the management fees paid for that number of months prior to the closing date of the\nhotel sale equal to the number of months remaining on the current term of the OTH Hotel Management Agreement. Upon the sale of\na hotel, no termination fee will be due in the event the Company elects to provide Our Town with the opportunity to manage another\ncomparable hotel and Our Town is not precluded from accepting such opportunity. Our Town is required to qualify as an eligible\nindependent contractor in order to permit the Company to continue to operate as a real estate investment trust.\nPursuant to the management agreements for the Hyde Resort & Residences and the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences,\nOur Town manages the rental of individually owned condominium units pursuant to rental agreements entered into with individual\ncondominium unit owners.

The Company was notified that DHG merged with BKD LLP (\"BKD\") on June 1, 2022, and the combined\npractice now operates under the name FORVIS, LLP. This change is a result of the merger and is not attributable to DHG's\nresignation or dismissal. The Company's audit engagement team did not change as a result of the merger.\nThe reports of FORVIS on the Company's and the Operating Partnership's financial statement for the fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 did not contain an adverse opinion, nor was the report qualified or modified as to\nuncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.

For purposes of this proposal, abstentions will not be\ncounted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of\ndetermining the presence of a quorum.\n32\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE\nRATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF FORVIS, LLP AS THE COMPANY’S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC\nACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE 2024 FISCAL YEAR\n33\nPROPOSAL III—ADVISORY AND NON-BINDING VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nAs required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Company is presenting this\nproposal which gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to approve or not approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, our pay\nprogram for named executive officers. On April 30, 2019, at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders, in a non-binding\nadvisory vote of the Company’s stockholders regarding the frequency of holding future advisory votes on executive compensation, the\nproposed frequency that received the majority of votes cast was every one year. In light of this result, the Company will hold a non-\nbinding advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next required vote on the frequency of stockholder votes on\nexecutive compensation. The Company anticipates holding a vote on the frequency of stockholder votes on executive compensation\nat its annual meeting of stockholders in 2025.\nAs described in detail under the heading “Director and Executive Compensation,” our executive compensation programs are\ndesigned to attract, incentivize and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to our success. Pursuant to these programs,\nthe Company seeks to compensate the named executive officers for achieving strategic business goals. Please read “Director and\nExecutive Compensation” for additional details about our executive compensation programs including information about the fiscal\nyear 2023 compensation of our named executive officers.\nAccordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote on the following proposed resolution at the Annual Meeting:\n“RESOLVED, that the Company’s stockholders approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, the compensation of the named\nexecutive officers, as disclosed in the Company’s Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the\ncompensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.”\nYou may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” this proposal or “ABSTAIN” from voting on this proposal.\nApproval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders of the\nCompany at the Annual Meeting. For purposes of this advisory vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes\ncast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the\npresence of a quorum. If your shares are held by your broker and you do not give your broker voting instructions, your shares will not\nbe voted on Proposal III. While our Board intends to carefully consider the stockholder vote resulting from the proposal, the final vote\nwill not be binding on us and is advisory in nature.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” PROPOSAL III.\n34\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR NEXT YEAR’S MEETING\nStockholder Proposals for the 2025 Annual Meeting.
