(Nasdaq: LYTS, “LSI” or the “Company”) a leading U.S. based manufacturer of commercial lighting and display solutions, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2025 first quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n** FISCAL 2025 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS **\n\n  * Net Sales of $138.1 million, +12% y/y \n  * Net Income of $6.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share \n  * Adjusted Net Income of $8.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share \n  * EBITDA of $12.1 million; Adjusted EBITDA $13.4 million \n  * Free Cash Flow of $11.1 million \n  * Ratio of net debt to TTM Adjusted EBITDA of 0.8x \n  * Display Solutions Backlog strong; Grocery vertical orders increased 90% y/y \n\n\n\nLSI demonstrated strong commercial and operational execution during the fiscal 2025 first quarter, a performance highlighted by consistent profitability, solid free cash flow generation, disciplined balance sheet management, and successful integration of EMI Industries, which LSI acquired on April 18, 2024. \n\nThe Company reported first quarter sales of $138.1 million, an increase of 12% versus the prior-year period, including $26.2 million sales contribution from the acquisition of EMI. On a comparable basis, revenue was below the prior-year period, driven by the timing of customer orders within the grocery vertical, together with lower large project activity within the Lighting segment. Total orders and backlog increased for the quarter, driven in part by a recovery in orders within the grocery vertical. \n\nLSI reported net income of $6.7 million and $0.22 per diluted share for the quarter, while adjusted net income was $8.0 million and $0.26 per share. EBITDA was $12.1 million for the quarter and adjusted EBITDA $13.4 million. \n\nLSI’s acquisition activity has increased in recent years, and inorganic growth is part of our long-term growth strategy, as outlined in our _Fast Forward_ plan. Management believes in providing increased transparency to our core operating results, therefore beginning with the fiscal first quarter 2025, LSI will include amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets as an add-back to its non-GAAP reconciliation. A complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, together with a comparison of current and prior year calculations, is included in this release. \n\nThe Company generated free cash flow of $11.1 million in the first quarter, driven by earnings and working capital efficiency. LSI ended the first quarter with approximately $49.0 million in cash and available liquidity, and a ratio of net debt to trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA of 0.8x. \n\nThe Company declared a regular cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on November 26, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 18, 2024. \n\n** MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY **\n\n“During a period of fluctuating demand levels within our vertical markets, LSI continues to build leading positions across our key markets during the first quarter, though a combination of new business wins, together with the recent, successful integration of EMI Industries,” stated James A. Clark, President, and Chief Executive Officer of LSI. \n\n“We continued to execute on large, multi-year customer programs within our refueling/c-store vertical during the quarter, while order rates within our grocery vertical increased materially versus the prior-year period,” continued Clark. “Overall order rates increased versus prior year, resulting in a 12% increase in backlog entering the second quarter. \n\n“The durability of our operating model was on display during the first quarter, as our diverse end-markets, long-term customer base, deep solutions portfolio, and unique value proposition supported a solid financial performance, highlighted by sustained profitability and free cash flow generation. \n\n“Within our Display Solutions segment, we continued to execute on an elevated backlog of refueling/c-store program wins awarded in fiscal 2024, which partially offset slower scheduled project activity within the grocery vertical,” continued Clark. “Importantly, order rates within our grocery vertical increased 90% in the first quarter and remain strong early into the second quarter, as both deferred maintenance and planned investments begin to rebound. Our grocery vertical book-to-bill was 1.3x in the first quarter, driven by the adoption of the new R290 refrigerant solution and increased demand for non-refrigerated display case products. As grocery vertical demand resumes, with our new products and increased production capacity, LSI is positioned to support the requirements of our customer base. \n\n“EMI delivered a near record performance in its first full quarter as an LSI company, driven by improved customer activity within the C-Store and Quick Serve Restaurant (“QSR”) verticals,” continued Clark. “Entering the fiscal second quarter, EMI continues to realize strong project quotation activity supported by a broad base of c-store, grocery and restaurant customer brands. Our integration of EMI is performing ahead of plan, with the collaboration with other divisions of LSI generating considerable cross-selling synergy opportunities across our comprehensive product and solution offerings. \n\n“We forecast positive activity to continue for Display Solutions in the fiscal second quarter with comparable sales expected to increase year-over-year, and backlog continuing to improve,” stated Clark. “Our second half fiscal 2025 is developing favorably, as much of the recent order activity is scheduled to commence after the holiday season, when store renovation activity is limited. \n\n“Within our Lighting segment, net sales declined year-over year due to lower levels of large project activity,” continued Clark. “While smaller project activity remains healthy, supported by a stable quote-to-order conversion period, we’ve seen a lengthening in the conversion period for large projects, particularly within the warehouse vertical, where construction starts have slowed. Conversely, we’ve continued to experience demand growth in select verticals, including refueling and sport court applications. We anticipate that our Lighting Segment performance will improve in the second quarter, when compared to the year-ago period, and larger known projects, many of which are on hold pending final approval, are released to move forward in the first half of calendar year 2025. Selling prices and material input costs remain stable across all verticals and applications. \n\n“Our Lighting go-to-market model is led by our strong portfolio of outdoor solutions,” stated Clark. “Our area lighting offering is considered one of the best in the industry, led by our _Mirada_ series of products. In the first quarter we formally launched an innovative family of area lights to complement our Mirada range, representing our largest lighting product launch in seven years. The _V-LOCITY™_ series fixtures offer a sleek, streamlined aesthetic design, and many distinct features providing numerous benefits to end users. Highlighting the benefits is the modular and configurable optical distribution options, customizable to specific applications. Ease and speed of installation is also a major differentiator, providing a unique, simplified solution to the challenging installation process. The interchangeable mounting system along with a lighter weight fixture is expected to generate a 45% reduction in installation time, representing a significant savings to the contractor and end-user. \n\nClark concluded, “We have built a stronger, more capable business during the last several years, a durable platform equipped to deliver profitable growth, consistent with the financial targets outlined in our _Fast Forward_ plan. We see significant opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth over the coming years as we capitalize on the favorable, long-term secular tailwinds evident across our key vertical markets. We remain committed to a balanced, disciplined approach to capital allocation, maximizing the balance of economic returns, ongoing investment, and shareholder value.” \n\n**FISCAL 2024 FIRST QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nA conference call will be held today at 11:00 A.M.

Lighting Segment net sales of $58.4 million decreased 14% from prior year’s first quarter net sales of 67.6 million while Display Solutions Segment net sales of $79.7 million increased 43% from prior year’s first quarter net sales of $55.8 million. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.7 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to $8.0 million or $0.27 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Earnings per share represents diluted earnings per share. \n\n** Balance Sheet **\n\nThe balance sheet at September 30, 2024 included current assets of $166.9 million, current liabilities of $80.1 million and working capital of $86.8 million, which includes cash of $7.0 million. The current ratio was 2.1 to 1. The balance sheet included shareholders’ equity of $211.2 million and long-term debt of $44.1 million. It is the Company’s priority to continuously generate sufficient cash flow, coupled with an approved credit facility, to adequately fund operations. \n\n** Cash Dividend Actions **\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share in connection with the first quarter of fiscal 2025, payable November 26, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 18, 2024. The indicated annual cash dividend rate is $0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which provides that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. \n\n** Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\nThis press release includes adjustments to GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Operating income, net income, and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of long-term performance based compensation expense, the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, commercial growth opportunity expense, acquisition costs, the lease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases, and restructuring and severance costs, are non-GAAP financial measures. We further note that while the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures, the revenue of the acquired companies is included in the measures and the acquired assets contribute to the generation of revenue. We believe these non-GAAP measures will provide increased transparency to our core operating performance of the business. Also included in this press release are non-GAAP financial measures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA), Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow. We believe that these are useful as supplemental measures in assessing the operating performance of our business. These measures are used by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results, and are frequently referenced by those who follow the Company. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations, in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should be used only to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to net income and earnings per share reported for the periods indicated along with the calculation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30**  \n---  \n_**(Unaudited) ** _  \n_**(In thousands, except per share data)** _ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \n**Net sales** |  **$** |  **138,095** |  **$** |  **123,441** |  **12** |  **%**  \n**Operating income as reported** |  **9,131** |  **11,028** |  **-17** |  **%**  \n**Long-term performance based compensation** |  **1,184** |  **1,325**  \n**Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets** |  **1,408** |  **1,190**  \n**Acquisition costs** |  **48** |  **-**  \n**Lease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases** |  **67** |  **-**  \n**Consulting expense: commercial growth initiatives** |  **-** |  **19**  \n**Severance costs and restructuring costs** |  **60** |  **353**  \n**Operating income as adjusted** |  **$** |  **11,898** |  **$** |  **13,915** |  **-14** |  **%**  \n**Net income as reported** |  **$** |  **6,682** |  **$** |  **8,028** |  **-17** |  **%**  \n**Net income as adjusted** |  **$** |  **7,981** |  **$** |  **9,610** |  **-17** |  **%**  \n**Earnings per share (diluted) as reported** |  **$** |  **0.22** |  **$** |  **0.27** |  **-19** |  **%**  \n**Earnings per share (diluted) as adjusted** |  **$** |  **0.26** |  **$** |  **0.32** |  **-19** |  **%**  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30**  \n_**(In thousands, except per share data)** _ |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Diluted EPS** |  **Diluted EPS**  \n**Reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income**  \n**Net income as reported** |  **$** |  **6,682** |  **$** |  **0.22** |  **$** |  **8,028** |  **$** |  **0.27**  \n**Long-term performance based compensation** |  **881** |  **0.03** |  **974** |  **0.03**  \n**Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets** |  **1,042** |  **0.03** |  **870** |  **0.03**  \n**Acquisition costs** |  **36** |  **-** |  **-** |  **-**  \n**Lease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases** |  **50** |  **-** |  **-** |  **-**  \n**Consulting expense: commercial growth initiatives** |  **-** |  **-** |  **13** |  **-**  \n**Severance costs and restructuring costs** |  **45** |  **-** |  **256** |  **0.01**  \n**Tax rate difference between reported and adjusted net income** |  **(755** |  **)** |  **(0.02** |  **)** |  **(531** |  **)** |  **(0.02** |  **)**  \n**Net income adjusted** |  **$** |  **7,981** |  **$** |  **0.26** |  **$** |  **9,610** |  **$** |  **0.32**  \n_**(Unaudited;

(Nasdaq: LYTS, “LSI” or the “Company”) a leading U.S. based manufacturer of commercial lighting and display solutions, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year ended June 30, 2024. \n\n** FISCAL 2024 FOURTH QUARTER **\n\n  * Net Sales $129.0 million, +4% to prior year \n  * Net Income $5.7 million, including $1.0 million of acquisition related expense \n  * Adj. Net Income $7.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share \n  * EBITDA $11.9 million; Adjusted EBITDA $14.0 million or 10.9%/sales \n  * Free Cash Flow $10.3 million \n  * Completed acquisition of EMI Industries for $50 million cash \n\n\n\n** FISCAL 2024 FULL YEAR **\n\n  * Net Sales $469.6 million \n  * Net Income $25.0 million or $0.83 per diluted share \n  * Adjusted Net Income $28.6 million, $0.95 per diluted share \n  * EBITDA of $45.5 million; Adjusted EBITDA $51.4 million or 11.0%/sales, +60 bps y/t/y \n  * Free Cash Flow of $38.0 million \n\n\n\nLSI demonstrated solid execution on its vertical market strategy during the fiscal fourth quarter, with an emphasis on higher-value, fully integrated solutions. The Company’s fourth quarter performance reflects continuation of recent demand trends which fluctuate by vertical market. \n\nAs previously disclosed, LSI acquired EMI Industries (“EMI”) on April 18, 2024, serving to further enhance its one-stop, end-to-end integrated display solutions offering within convenience store, grocery, and restaurant industries. LSI believes the transaction, which is immediately accretive to LSI’s adjusted earnings per share, will provide significant commercial synergy potential through the coming years, consistent with the value creation thesis outlined within LSI’s _Fast Forward_ Strategy. \n\nLSI reported net sales of $129.0 million in the quarter, including $18.1 million of partial-quarter contribution from EMI. Excluding EMI, sales declined versus the prior-year period, due largely to continued lower demand in the grocery vertical. Lower grocery sales activity was due primarily to the proposed merger of two large industry participants, which we have previously reported and remains under regulatory review at this time. \n\nFourth quarter net income was $5.7 million, including $1.0 million of non-recurring EMI acquisition related expense. Adjusted net income was $7.3 million in the fourth quarter, or $0.24 per diluted share, while Adjusted EBITDA was $14.0 million or 10.9% of net sales. \n\nLSI generated $10.3 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, driven by the continued high-level conversion of earnings to cash and working capital efficiency. \n\nFor the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, LSI reported net sales of $469.6 million, or $0.95 per adjusted diluted share. For the full-year fiscal 2024, LSI delivered appreciable margin rate expansion, reflecting a strong focus on quality of earnings. Adjusted EBITDA of $51.4 million was comparable to prior year despite lower sales, reflecting strong operational discipline and cost controls, while the full year Adjusted EBITDA margin rate was 11.0% or 60 basis points above the prior-year period. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial results is included in this press release. \n\nFull fiscal-year free cash flow was $38.0 million, enabling the Company to reinvest throughout the year in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives. LSI exits fiscal year 2024 with a healthy balance sheet, with a net leverage ratio of 1.0x, including the acquisition of EMI in April. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $50 million of cash and availability under its existing credit facility. \n\nThe Company declared a regular cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on September 3, 2024, to shareholders of record on August 26, 2024. \n\n** MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY **\n\n“The fiscal fourth quarter concludes a pivotal year for our business, as we continued to expand our vertical market capabilities, including the acquisition of EMI Industries,” stated James A. Clark, President, and CEO of LSI. “Executing on our multi-year value-creation strategy, we have continued to develop leading positions across growing industry verticals, strengthened relationships across key partners and channels, and further improved our quality of earnings. LSI brings an unmatched portfolio of integrated solutions to every customer opportunity. \n\n“Sound execution underscores our fourth quarter performance, as LSI achieved solid financial results while effectively managing an environment of fluctuating demand levels,” continued Clark. “For the full fiscal year, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of over $51 million, approximately equal to our record prior year level, and expanded EBITDA margin by sixty basis points to 11.0%. We generated free cash flow of over $38 million and exit the year with a strong balance sheet including a net leverage ratio of 1.0x. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our team, we continue to demonstrate structurally higher performance levels across our end markets. \n\n“The underlying demand fundamentals for our key markets remain healthy and we are positioned to achieve another year of profitable growth in fiscal 2025. Growth is expected to resume within the grocery vertical over the coming year, and our display solutions backlog for the refueling/c-store market is strong entering fiscal 2025, reflecting multiple major customer program wins in the second half of fiscal 2024. In addition, with our recent acquisition of EMI, we are excited to offer our customers an even broader array of complementary products and solutions, while cross-selling into both new and existing relationships. Our ability to serve the full project lifecycle, from concept, to installation, to ongoing support, provides meaningful opportunity to capture value across each phase of the project continuum, further strengthening our customers’ trust and confidence in LSI, and earn an increased share of business. \n\n“Over the last year, we’ve continued to invest in innovation, positioning us to introduce new, next generation applications within our vertical markets, ” stated Clark. “We introduced more than twenty-five new or enhanced products in fiscal 2024, covering both the Lighting and Display Solutions segments, and have a steady pipeline slated for launch in fiscal 2025, maintaining a product vitality rate of over 30%. Activity in Display Solutions was highlighted by the introduction of our new refrigerated display case series of products utilizing the environmentally friendly R290 technology, which is free of ozone depleting properties. Initial shipments began in the fourth quarter, and we are well positioned to capitalize on resumption of demand in the grocery vertical, where several large customers have publicly stated their intent to fully convert to R290 technology. \n\n“Additionally, we continued to strengthen our relationships with our channel partners and end customers throughout fiscal 2024. Our teams conducted a record number of lighting training sessions at our Cincinnati headquarters and other locations last year, including personnel from our external sales agency partners, distributors, contractors, and end users. In May, we hosted all our agency principals for a three-day conference, collaborating on growth plans for fiscal 2025 and beyond. With over eighty executives in attendance from over forty firms, we outlined product roadmaps and new product launch schedules, and discussed sales force requirements to be successful. \n\n“Within the Lighting segment, we experienced generally stable demand conditions across most of our vertical markets in the fourth quarter,” stated Clark. “In fiscal 2024, sales were 4% below prior year, with LSI outperforming the broader market, capturing share in select vertical markets. Operating income for the year increased 5% driven by the 200-basis point increase in gross margin. Recent trends continue as project quotation levels remain steady; however, the quote-to-order conversion period remains extended, particularly for larger project activity. Construction schedule changes persist due to non-lighting supply chain issues together with availability of skilled labor. With lighting installation occurring in the late-cycle phase of construction, we continue to incur high levels of production schedule changes to our backlog, given changes in project timing. Pricing for project quotations remains stable and we expect that trend to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. \n\n“Fourth quarter Display Solutions sales increased 22% versus the prior year period, including the partial quarter impact of the EMI acquisition. Sales of print and digital graphics increased 9% in the quarter driven by the multiple, large program orders received in previous quarters. Momentum is expected to continue into fiscal 2025 and we enter the year with a strong backlog in the refueling/c-store vertical. The service and installation portion of our business realized stair-step growth in the quarter and will be leveraged across multiple customer programs throughout fiscal 2025. While fourth quarter Display Case sales to the grocery vertical remained soft as expected, orders were above the prior year quarter, resulting in the first year-over-year order increase in five quarters. \n\nClark concluded: “LSI enters fiscal 2025 well positioned to execute the next phase of our vertical market strategy. We remain encouraged by the expectations of emerging, multi-year investment cycles across our key vertical markets; the significant commercial potential provided by our expanded products and solutions; our strong relationships with both our channel partners and loyal end-users; the high level of talent and engagement we see across the organization; and optionality provided by our strong, well-capitalized balance sheet. We are building a differentiated model which we are confident will deliver sustained, profitable growth over time, while creating long-term value for our shareholders.” \n\n**FISCAL 2024 FOURTH QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nA conference call will be held today at 11:00 A.M.

Lighting Segment net sales of $65.1 million decreased 9% and Display Solutions Segment net sales of $63.9 million increased 22% from last year’s fourth quarter net sales. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was $5.7 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to $8.4 million or $0.28 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Earnings per share represents diluted earnings per share. \n\n** Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2024, Results **\n\nNet sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, were $469.6 million, down 6% from the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, reported net sales of $497.0 million. Lighting Segment net sales of $262.4 million decreased 4% and Display Solutions Segment net sales of $207.2 million decreased 7% from last year’s net sales. Net income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, was $25.0 million, or $0.83 per share, compared to $25.8 million or $0.88 per share for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. Earnings per share represents diluted earnings per share. \n\n** Balance Sheet **\n\nThe balance sheet on June 30, 2024, included current assets of $162.5 million, current liabilities of $79.2 million and working capital of $83.3 million, which includes cash of $4.1 million. The current ratio was 2.1 to 1. The balance sheet also included shareholders’ equity of $204.4 million and long-term debt of $50.7 million. It is the Company’s priority to continuously generate sufficient cash flow, coupled with our credit facility, to adequately fund operations. \n\n** Cash Dividend Actions **\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, payable September 3, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 26, 2024. The indicated annual cash dividend rate is $0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which provides that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. \n\n** Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\nThis press release includes adjustments to GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023. Operating income, net income, and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of long-term performance based compensation expense, commercial growth opportunity expense, acquisition costs, and restructuring and severance costs, are non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude these items because we believe they are not representative of the ongoing results of operations of the business. Also included in this press release are non-GAAP financial measures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA), Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow. We believe that these are useful as supplemental measures in assessing the operating performance of our business. These measures are used by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results, and are frequently referenced by those who follow the Company. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations, in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should be used only to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to net income and earnings per share reported for the periods indicated along with the calculation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. \n\n**Three Months Ended June 30** |  **Twelve Months Ended June 30**  \n---|---  \n_**(Unaudited) ** _  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change** |  _**(In thousands, except per share data)** _ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \n**$** |  **129,007** |  **$** |  **123,636** |  **4** |  **%** |  **Net sales** |  **$** |  **469,638** |  **$** |  **496,979** |  **-6** |  **%**  \n**9,011** |  **10,237** |  **-12** |  **%** |  **Operating income as reported** |  **35,517** |  **37,028** |  **-4** |  **%**  \n**1,185** |  **1,477** |  **-20** |  **%** |  **Long-Term Performance Based Compensation** |  **4,380** |  **3,998** |  **10** |  **%**  \n**982** |  **-** |  **NM** |  **Acquisition costs** |  **1,001** |  **-** |  **NM**  \n**10** |  **20** |  **-50** |  **%** |  **Restructuring/Severance costs** |  **539** |  **66** |  **717** |  **%**  \n**-** |  **-** |  **NM** |  **Consulting expense: Commercial Growth Initiatives** |  **-** |  **864** |  **NM**  \n**$** |  **11,188** |  **$** |  **11,734** |  **-5** |  **%** |  **Operating income as adjusted** |  **$** |  **41,437** |  **$** |  **41,956** |  **-1** |  **%**  \n**$** |  **5,668** |  **$** |  **8,415** |  **-33** |  **%** |  **Net income as reported** |  **$** |  **24,977** |  **$** |  **25,762** |  **-3** |  **%**  \n**$** |  **7,278** |  **$** |  **8,797** |  **-17** |  **%** |  **Net income as adjusted** |  **$** |  **28,625** |  **$** |  **28,997** |  **-1** |  **%**  \n**$** |  **0.19** |  **$** |  **0.28** |  **-33** |  **%** |  **Earnings per share (diluted) as reported** |  **$** |  **0.83** |  **$** |  **0.88** |  **-6** |  **%**  \n**$** |  **0.24** |  **$** |  **0.30** |  **-20** |  **%** |  **Earnings per share (diluted) as adjusted** |  **$** |  **0.95** |  **$** |  **0.99** |  **-4** |  **%**  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Twelve Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**June 30** |  **June 30**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  _**(In thousands, except per share data)** _ |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Diluted EPS** |  **Diluted EPS** |  **Diluted EPS** |  **Diluted EPS**  \n**Reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income**  \n**$** |  **5,668** |  **$** |  **0.19** |  **$** |  **8,415** |  **$** |  **0.28** |  **Net income as reported** |  **$** |  **24,977** |  **$** |  **0.83** |  **$** |  **25,762** |  **$** |  **0.88**  \n**906** |  **0.03** |  **771** |  **0.03** |  **Long-Term Performance Based Compensation** |  **3,272** |  **0.11** |  **2,879** |  **0.10**  \n**722** |  **0.02** |  **-** |  **-** |  **Acquisition costs** |  **735** |  **0.02** |  **-** |  **-**  \n**6** |  **-** |  **13** |  **-** |  **Restructuring/Severance costs** |  **396** |  **0.01** |  **51** |  **-**  \n**-** |  **-** |  **-** |  **-** |  **Consulting expense: Commercial Growth Initiatives** |  **-** |  **-** |  **707** |  **0.02**  \n**(24** |  **)** |  **-** |  **(402** |  **)** |  **(0.01** |  **)** |  **Tax rate difference between reported and adjusted net income** |  **(755** |  **)** |  **(0.03** |  **)** |  **(402** |  **)** |  **(0.01** |  **)**  \n**$** |  **7,278** |  **$** |  **0.24** |  **$** |  **8,797** |  **$** |  **0.30** |  **Net income adjusted** |  **$** |  **28,625** |  **$** |  **0.95** |  **$** |  **28,997** |  **$** |  **0.99**  \n**Three Months Ended June 30** |  _**(Unaudited;

The\nPrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business,\nfinancialperformance, financial condition and results of operations, often contain words such as “estimates,” “targets,” “anticipates,” “hopes,” “projects,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “believes,”\n“seeks,”“may,” “will,” “see,” “should” and similar expressions and the negative versions of those words, and may be identified by the context in which they are used.\nSuch statements, whether expressed or implied, are based upon current expectations of LSI and speak only as of the date made. Reliance should not be placed on forward-looking\nstatements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those\nexpressed or implied. Forward-looking statementsinclude statements that address activities, events or developments that LSI expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future,\nsuch as earnings estimates (including projections andguidance) and other predictions of financial performance. Forward-looking statements are based on LSI’s experience and perception\nof current conditions, trends, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,\nmany of which are beyond LSI’s control.\nThese risks and uncertaintiesinclude, but are not limited to the following: the impact of competitive products and services; product and pricing demands, and market acceptance risks; LSI’s\nreliance on third-partymanufacturers and suppliers; substantial changes to the refueling and convenience store and grocery markets; LSI’s stock price volatility; potential costs associated\nwith litigation, other proceedings and regulatory compliance; LSI’s ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet customers’ needs; LSI’s ability to adequately protect\nintellectual property; information technology security threats and computer crime; reliance on customers and partner relationships; financial difficulties experienced by customers; the\ncyclical andseasonal nature of our business; the adequacy of reserves and allowances for doubtful accounts; the failure of investments, acquisitions or acquired companies to achieve their\nplans or objectives generally; unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses; the inability to effectively execute our business strategies; the ability to retain key employees,\nincluding key employees of acquired businesses; labor shortages or an increase in labor costs; changes in shift in product mix; unfavorable economic, political, and market conditions,\nincluding interest rate fluctuations; changes in U.S. trade policy; the results of asset impairment assessments; risks related to disruptions or reductions in business operations or prospects\ndue to international conflicts and wars, pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaksof infectious diseases such as the coronavirus disease COVID-19; price increases\nof materials; significant shortages of materials; shortages in transportation; increases in fuel prices; sudden or unexpected changes in customer creditworthiness; not recognizing all revenue\nor not receiving all customer payments; write-offs or impairment of capitalized costs or intangible assets in the future or restructuring costs; anti-takeover provisions in LSI’s organizational\ndocuments and in Ohio law; and the other risk factors LSI describes from time to time in SEC filings. There may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently\nbelieve are immaterial which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nYou are cautioned to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. LSI does not guarantee any forward-looking statement, and actual results may differ materially from\nthose projected.

Gross Margin, operating income, net income, and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of long-term performance-based\ncompensation, severance costs, restructuring costs, and consulting expenses supporting commercial growth initiatives, are non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe exclude these non-recurring items because we believe they are not representative of the ongoing results of operations of our business. Also included in\nthis presentation are non-GAAP financial measures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA), Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt. We believe that these are useful as supplemental measures in assessing the operating performance of our business.\nThese measures are used by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results and are frequently referenced by\nthose who follow the Company. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-\nGAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect\nall amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should be used only to evaluate our results\nin conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the net income and earnings per share\nreported for the periods indicated, along with the calculation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt.\n©2024 LSI INDUSTRIES 36\nNon-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n©2024 LSI INDUSTRIES 37\nNon-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n©2024 LSI INDUSTRIES 38\nNon-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n©2024 LSI INDUSTRIES 39\nNon-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n©2024 LSI INDUSTRIES 40\nFor Additional Questions,\nPlease Contact\n720.778.2415\nThank You,\nLSI Investor Relations"

Gross Margin, operating income, net income, and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of long-term performance-based\ncompensation, severance costs, restructuring costs, lease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases, the amortization expense of acquired intangible\nassets, consulting expenses supporting commercial growth initiatives, and acquisition costs are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP\nmeasures will provide increased transparency to our core operating performance of the business. Also included in this presentation are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA), Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt. We\nbelieve that these are useful as supplemental measures in assessing the operating performance of our business. These measures are used by our\nmanagement, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results and are frequently referenced by those who follow the Company.\nThese non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are not based on any\ncomprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results\nas determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should be used only to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding\nGAAP measures. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the net income and earnings per share reported for the periods indicated, along\nwith the calculation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt.\n©2024 LSI INDUSTRIES 10\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\nLSI Industries Q1 2024 Q1 2025\nNet Sales 123,441 138,095\nGross Margin 3 6,589 3 3,647\nLease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases - 67\nSeverance costs/Restructuring costs\n3 47 39\nAdjusted Gross Margin 3 6,936 3 3,753\nAdjusted Gross Margin % 29.9% 24.4%\nLighting Segment Q1 2024 Q1 2025\nNet Sales 6 7,641 5 8,437\nGross Margin 2 3,280 1 8,626\nSeverance costs/Restructuring costs - 37\nAdjusted Gross Margin 2 3,280 1 8,663\nAdjusted Gross Margin % 34.4% 31.9%\nDisplay Solutions Segment Q1 2024 Q1 2025\nNet Sales 5 5,800 7 9,658\nGross Margin 1 3,310 1 5,030\nLease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases - 67\nSeverance costs/Restructuring costs 3 47 1\nAdjusted Gross Margin 1 3,657 1 5,098\nAdjusted Gross Margin % 24.5% 19.0%\n©2024 LSI INDUSTRIES 11\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\nLSI Industries Q1 2024 Q1 2025 Lighting Segment Q1 2024 Q1 2025\nNet Sales 1 23,441 1 38,095 Net Sales 6 7,641 5 8,437\nOperating Income 11,028 9,131 Operating Income 8,753 5,759\nAcquisition costs - 48 Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets 603 603\nConsulting expense: commercial growth initiatives 19 - Severance costs/Restructuring costs - 60\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets 1,190 1,408 Long-term performance based compensation 92 69\nLease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases - 67 Adjusted Operating Income 9,448 6,491\nSeverance costs/Restructuring costs 353 60 Adjusted Operating % 14.0% 11.1%\nLong-term performance based compensation 1,325 1,184 Depreciation Expense 706 609\nAdjusted Operating Income 13,915 11,898 Adjusted EBITDA 10,154 7,100\nAdjusted Operating % 11.3% 8.6% Adjusted EBITDA % 15.0% 12.1%\nDepreciation Expense 1,181 1,532\nAdjusted EBITDA 15,096 13,430 Display Solutions Segment Q1 2024 Q1 2025\nAdjusted EBITDA % 12.2% 9.7% Net Sales 5 5,800 7 9,658\nOperating Income 7,219 7,708\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets 587 805\nLease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases - 67\nSeverance costs/Restructuring costs 353 1\nLong-term performance based compensation 309 285\nAdjusted Operating Income 8,468 8,866\nAdjusted Operating % 15.2% 11.1%\nDepreciation and amortization 389 830\nAdjusted EBITDA 8,857 9,696\nAdjusted EBITDA % 15.9% 12.2%\n©2024 LSI INDUSTRIES 12\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\nDiluted Diluted Diluted Diluted Diluted\nLSI Industries Q1 2024 EPS Q2 2024 EPS Q3 2024 EPS Q4 2024 EPS Q1 2025 EPS\nNet Income Reported $ 8 ,028 $ 0.27 $ 5 ,906 $ 0.20 $ 5,375 $ 0.18 $ 5,668 $ 0.19 $ 6,682 $ 0 .22\nAcquisition costs - - - - - - 722 0.02 $ 3 6 $ -\nConsulting expense: commercial growth initiatives 13 - - - - - - - - -\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets 870 0.03 885 0.03 888 0.03 1,028 0.04 1,042 0.03\nLease expense on the step-up basis of acquired leases - - - - - - - - 50 -\nSeverance costs/Restructuring costs 256 0.01 34 - 101 - 5 - 45 -\nLong-term performance based compensation 974 0.03 625 0.02 767 0.03 906 0.03 881 0.03\nTax rate difference between reported and adjusted net income (531) (0.02) (201) (0.01) - ( 25) - (755) ( 0.02)\nNet Income Adjusted $ 9,610 $ 0 .32 $ 7,249 $ 0 .24 $ 7,131 $ 0 .24 $ 8,304 $ 0.28 $ 7,981 $ 0.26\nAdjusted Net Income % 7.8% 6.7% 6.6% 6.4% 5.8%\nEffective in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, LSI will include the amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets as an add-back to its non-GAAP\nreconciliation.

(Nasdaq: LYTS, “LSI” or the “Company”) a leading U.S. based manufacturer of commercial lighting and display solutions, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year ended June 30, 2024. \n\n** FISCAL 2024 FOURTH QUARTER **\n\n  * Net Sales $129.0 million, +4% to prior year \n  * Net Income $5.7 million, including $1.0 million of acquisition related expense \n  * Adj. Net Income $7.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share \n  * EBITDA $11.9 million; Adjusted EBITDA $14.0 million or 10.9%/sales \n  * Free Cash Flow $10.3 million \n  * Completed acquisition of EMI Industries for $50 million cash \n\n\n\n** FISCAL 2024 FULL YEAR **\n\n  * Net Sales $469.6 million \n  * Net Income $25.0 million or $0.83 per diluted share \n  * Adjusted Net Income $28.6 million, $0.95 per diluted share \n  * EBITDA of $45.5 million; Adjusted EBITDA $51.4 million or 11.0%/sales, +60 bps y/t/y \n  * Free Cash Flow of $38.0 million \n\n\n\nLSI demonstrated solid execution on its vertical market strategy during the fiscal fourth quarter, with an emphasis on higher-value, fully integrated solutions. The Company’s fourth quarter performance reflects continuation of recent demand trends which fluctuate by vertical market. \n\nAs previously disclosed, LSI acquired EMI Industries (“EMI”) on April 18, 2024, serving to further enhance its one-stop, end-to-end integrated display solutions offering within convenience store, grocery, and restaurant industries. LSI believes the transaction, which is immediately accretive to LSI’s adjusted earnings per share, will provide significant commercial synergy potential through the coming years, consistent with the value creation thesis outlined within LSI’s _Fast Forward_ Strategy. \n\nLSI reported net sales of $129.0 million in the quarter, including $18.1 million of partial-quarter contribution from EMI. Excluding EMI, sales declined versus the prior-year period, due largely to continued lower demand in the grocery vertical. Lower grocery sales activity was due primarily to the proposed merger of two large industry participants, which we have previously reported and remains under regulatory review at this time. \n\nFourth quarter net income was $5.7 million, including $1.0 million of non-recurring EMI acquisition related expense. Adjusted net income was $7.3 million in the fourth quarter, or $0.24 per diluted share, while Adjusted EBITDA was $14.0 million or 10.9% of net sales. \n\nLSI generated $10.3 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, driven by the continued high-level conversion of earnings to cash and working capital efficiency. \n\nFor the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, LSI reported net sales of $469.6 million, or $0.95 per adjusted diluted share. For the full-year fiscal 2024, LSI delivered appreciable margin rate expansion, reflecting a strong focus on quality of earnings. Adjusted EBITDA of $51.4 million was comparable to prior year despite lower sales, reflecting strong operational discipline and cost controls, while the full year Adjusted EBITDA margin rate was 11.0% or 60 basis points above the prior-year period. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial results is included in this press release. \n\nFull fiscal-year free cash flow was $38.0 million, enabling the Company to reinvest throughout the year in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives. LSI exits fiscal year 2024 with a healthy balance sheet, with a net leverage ratio of 1.0x, including the acquisition of EMI in April. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $50 million of cash and availability under its existing credit facility. \n\nThe Company declared a regular cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on September 3, 2024, to shareholders of record on August 26, 2024. \n\n** MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY **\n\n“The fiscal fourth quarter concludes a pivotal year for our business, as we continued to expand our vertical market capabilities, including the acquisition of EMI Industries,” stated James A. Clark, President, and CEO of LSI. “Executing on our multi-year value-creation strategy, we have continued to develop leading positions across growing industry verticals, strengthened relationships across key partners and channels, and further improved our quality of earnings. LSI brings an unmatched portfolio of integrated solutions to every customer opportunity. \n\n“Sound execution underscores our fourth quarter performance, as LSI achieved solid financial results while effectively managing an environment of fluctuating demand levels,” continued Clark. “For the full fiscal year, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of over $51 million, approximately equal to our record prior year level, and expanded EBITDA margin by sixty basis points to 11.0%. We generated free cash flow of over $38 million and exit the year with a strong balance sheet including a net leverage ratio of 1.0x. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our team, we continue to demonstrate structurally higher performance levels across our end markets. \n\n“The underlying demand fundamentals for our key markets remain healthy and we are positioned to achieve another year of profitable growth in fiscal 2025. Growth is expected to resume within the grocery vertical over the coming year, and our display solutions backlog for the refueling/c-store market is strong entering fiscal 2025, reflecting multiple major customer program wins in the second half of fiscal 2024. In addition, with our recent acquisition of EMI, we are excited to offer our customers an even broader array of complementary products and solutions, while cross-selling into both new and existing relationships. Our ability to serve the full project lifecycle, from concept, to installation, to ongoing support, provides meaningful opportunity to capture value across each phase of the project continuum, further strengthening our customers’ trust and confidence in LSI, and earn an increased share of business. \n\n“Over the last year, we’ve continued to invest in innovation, positioning us to introduce new, next generation applications within our vertical markets, ” stated Clark. “We introduced more than twenty-five new or enhanced products in fiscal 2024, covering both the Lighting and Display Solutions segments, and have a steady pipeline slated for launch in fiscal 2025, maintaining a product vitality rate of over 30%. Activity in Display Solutions was highlighted by the introduction of our new refrigerated display case series of products utilizing the environmentally friendly R290 technology, which is free of ozone depleting properties. Initial shipments began in the fourth quarter, and we are well positioned to capitalize on resumption of demand in the grocery vertical, where several large customers have publicly stated their intent to fully convert to R290 technology. \n\n“Additionally, we continued to strengthen our relationships with our channel partners and end customers throughout fiscal 2024. Our teams conducted a record number of lighting training sessions at our Cincinnati headquarters and other locations last year, including personnel from our external sales agency partners, distributors, contractors, and end users. In May, we hosted all our agency principals for a three-day conference, collaborating on growth plans for fiscal 2025 and beyond. With over eighty executives in attendance from over forty firms, we outlined product roadmaps and new product launch schedules, and discussed sales force requirements to be successful. \n\n“Within the Lighting segment, we experienced generally stable demand conditions across most of our vertical markets in the fourth quarter,” stated Clark. “In fiscal 2024, sales were 4% below prior year, with LSI outperforming the broader market, capturing share in select vertical markets. Operating income for the year increased 5% driven by the 200-basis point increase in gross margin. Recent trends continue as project quotation levels remain steady; however, the quote-to-order conversion period remains extended, particularly for larger project activity. Construction schedule changes persist due to non-lighting supply chain issues together with availability of skilled labor. With lighting installation occurring in the late-cycle phase of construction, we continue to incur high levels of production schedule changes to our backlog, given changes in project timing. Pricing for project quotations remains stable and we expect that trend to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. \n\n“Fourth quarter Display Solutions sales increased 22% versus the prior year period, including the partial quarter impact of the EMI acquisition. Sales of print and digital graphics increased 9% in the quarter driven by the multiple, large program orders received in previous quarters. Momentum is expected to continue into fiscal 2025 and we enter the year with a strong backlog in the refueling/c-store vertical. The service and installation portion of our business realized stair-step growth in the quarter and will be leveraged across multiple customer programs throughout fiscal 2025. While fourth quarter Display Case sales to the grocery vertical remained soft as expected, orders were above the prior year quarter, resulting in the first year-over-year order increase in five quarters. \n\nClark concluded: “LSI enters fiscal 2025 well positioned to execute the next phase of our vertical market strategy. We remain encouraged by the expectations of emerging, multi-year investment cycles across our key vertical markets; the significant commercial potential provided by our expanded products and solutions; our strong relationships with both our channel partners and loyal end-users; the high level of talent and engagement we see across the organization; and optionality provided by our strong, well-capitalized balance sheet. We are building a differentiated model which we are confident will deliver sustained, profitable growth over time, while creating long-term value for our shareholders.” \n\n**FISCAL 2024 FOURTH QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nA conference call will be held today at 11:00 A.M.

Lighting Segment net sales of $65.1 million decreased 9% and Display Solutions Segment net sales of $63.9 million increased 22% from last year’s fourth quarter net sales. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was $5.7 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to $8.4 million or $0.28 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Earnings per share represents diluted earnings per share. \n\n** Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2024, Results **\n\nNet sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, were $469.6 million, down 6% from the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, reported net sales of $497.0 million. Lighting Segment net sales of $262.4 million decreased 4% and Display Solutions Segment net sales of $207.2 million decreased 7% from last year’s net sales. Net income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, was $25.0 million, or $0.83 per share, compared to $25.8 million or $0.88 per share for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. Earnings per share represents diluted earnings per share. \n\n** Balance Sheet **\n\nThe balance sheet on June 30, 2024, included current assets of $162.5 million, current liabilities of $79.2 million and working capital of $83.3 million, which includes cash of $4.1 million. The current ratio was 2.1 to 1. The balance sheet also included shareholders’ equity of $204.4 million and long-term debt of $50.7 million. It is the Company’s priority to continuously generate sufficient cash flow, coupled with our credit facility, to adequately fund operations. \n\n** Cash Dividend Actions **\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, payable September 3, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 26, 2024. The indicated annual cash dividend rate is $0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which provides that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. \n\n** Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\nThis press release includes adjustments to GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023. Operating income, net income, and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of long-term performance based compensation expense, commercial growth opportunity expense, acquisition costs, and restructuring and severance costs, are non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude these items because we believe they are not representative of the ongoing results of operations of the business. Also included in this press release are non-GAAP financial measures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA), Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow. We believe that these are useful as supplemental measures in assessing the operating performance of our business. These measures are used by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results, and are frequently referenced by those who follow the Company. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations, in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should be used only to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to net income and earnings per share reported for the periods indicated along with the calculation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. \n\n**Three Months Ended June 30** |  **Twelve Months Ended June 30**  \n---|---  \n_**(Unaudited) ** _  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change** |  _**(In thousands, except per share data)** _ |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \n**$** |  **129,007** |  **$** |  **123,636** |  **4** |  **%** |  **Net sales** |  **$** |  **469,638** |  **$** |  **496,979** |  **-6** |  **%**  \n**9,011** |  **10,237** |  **-12** |  **%** |  **Operating income as reported** |  **35,517** |  **37,028** |  **-4** |  **%**  \n**1,185** |  **1,477** |  **-20** |  **%** |  **Long-Term Performance Based Compensation** |  **4,380** |  **3,998** |  **10** |  **%**  \n**982** |  **-** |  **NM** |  **Acquisition costs** |  **1,001** |  **-** |  **NM**  \n**10** |  **20** |  **-50** |  **%** |  **Restructuring/Severance costs** |  **539** |  **66** |  **717** |  **%**  \n**-** |  **-** |  **NM** |  **Consulting expense: Commercial Growth Initiatives** |  **-** |  **864** |  **NM**  \n**$** |  **11,188** |  **$** |  **11,734** |  **-5** |  **%** |  **Operating income as adjusted** |  **$** |  **41,437** |  **$** |  **41,956** |  **-1** |  **%**  \n**$** |  **5,668** |  **$** |  **8,415** |  **-33** |  **%** |  **Net income as reported** |  **$** |  **24,977** |  **$** |  **25,762** |  **-3** |  **%**  \n**$** |  **7,278** |  **$** |  **8,797** |  **-17** |  **%** |  **Net income as adjusted** |  **$** |  **28,625** |  **$** |  **28,997** |  **-1** |  **%**  \n**$** |  **0.19** |  **$** |  **0.28** |  **-33** |  **%** |  **Earnings per share (diluted) as reported** |  **$** |  **0.83** |  **$** |  **0.88** |  **-6** |  **%**  \n**$** |  **0.24** |  **$** |  **0.30** |  **-20** |  **%** |  **Earnings per share (diluted) as adjusted** |  **$** |  **0.95** |  **$** |  **0.99** |  **-4** |  **%**  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Twelve Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**June 30** |  **June 30**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  _**(In thousands, except per share data)** _ |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Diluted EPS** |  **Diluted EPS** |  **Diluted EPS** |  **Diluted EPS**  \n**Reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income**  \n**$** |  **5,668** |  **$** |  **0.19** |  **$** |  **8,415** |  **$** |  **0.28** |  **Net income as reported** |  **$** |  **24,977** |  **$** |  **0.83** |  **$** |  **25,762** |  **$** |  **0.88**  \n**906** |  **0.03** |  **771** |  **0.03** |  **Long-Term Performance Based Compensation** |  **3,272** |  **0.11** |  **2,879** |  **0.10**  \n**722** |  **0.02** |  **-** |  **-** |  **Acquisition costs** |  **735** |  **0.02** |  **-** |  **-**  \n**6** |  **-** |  **13** |  **-** |  **Restructuring/Severance costs** |  **396** |  **0.01** |  **51** |  **-**  \n**-** |  **-** |  **-** |  **-** |  **Consulting expense: Commercial Growth Initiatives** |  **-** |  **-** |  **707** |  **0.02**  \n**(24** |  **)** |  **-** |  **(402** |  **)** |  **(0.01** |  **)** |  **Tax rate difference between reported and adjusted net income** |  **(755** |  **)** |  **(0.03** |  **)** |  **(402** |  **)** |  **(0.01** |  **)**  \n**$** |  **7,278** |  **$** |  **0.24** |  **$** |  **8,797** |  **$** |  **0.30** |  **Net income adjusted** |  **$** |  **28,625** |  **$** |  **0.95** |  **$** |  **28,997** |  **$** |  **0.99**  \n**Three Months Ended June 30** |  _**(Unaudited;

          "content": "Fiscal Fourth Quarter\nAnd Full-Year\n2024 Results\nConference Call\nAugust 15, 2024\nDISCLAIMER\nThis presentation contains “forward-looking statements”—that is, statements related to future events within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The\nPrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business,\nfinancialperformance, financial condition and results of operations, often contain words such as “estimates,” “targets,” “anticipates,” “hopes,” “projects,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “believes,”\n“seeks,”“may,” “will,” “see,” “should” and similar expressions and the negative versions of those words, and may be identified by the context in which they are used.\nSuch statements, whether expressed or implied, are based upon current expectations of LSI and speak only as of the date made. Reliance should not be placed on forward-looking\nstatements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those\nexpressed or implied. Forward-looking statementsinclude statements that address activities, events or developments that LSI expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future,\nsuch as earnings estimates (including projections andguidance) and other predictions of financial performance. Forward-looking statements are based on LSI’s experience and perception\nof current conditions, trends, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,\nmany of which are beyond LSI’s control.\nThese risks and uncertaintiesinclude, but are not limited to the following: the impact of competitive products and services; product and pricing demands, and market acceptance risks; LSI’s\nreliance on third-partymanufacturers and suppliers; substantial changes to the refueling and convenience store and grocery markets; LSI’s stock price volatility; potential costs associated\nwith litigation, other proceedings and regulatory compliance; LSI’s ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet customers’ needs; LSI’s ability to adequately protect\nintellectual property; information technology security threats and computer crime; reliance on customers and partner relationships; financial difficulties experienced by customers; the\ncyclical andseasonal nature of our business; the adequacy of reserves and allowances for doubtful accounts; the failure of investments, acquisitions or acquired companies to achieve their\nplans or objectives generally; unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses; the inability to effectively execute our business strategies; the ability to retain key employees,\nincluding key employees of acquired businesses; labor shortages or an increase in labor costs; changes in shift in product mix; unfavorable economic, political, and market conditions,\nincluding interest rate fluctuations; changes in U.S. trade policy; the results of asset impairment assessments; risks related to disruptions or reductions in business operations or prospects\ndue to international conflicts and wars, pandemics, epidemics, widespread health emergencies, or outbreaksof infectious diseases such as the coronavirus disease COVID-19; price increases\nof materials; significant shortages of materials; shortages in transportation; increases in fuel prices; sudden or unexpected changes in customer creditworthiness; not recognizing all revenue\nor not receiving all customer payments; write-offs or impairment of capitalized costs or intangible assets in the future or restructuring costs; anti-takeover provisions in LSI’s organizational\ndocuments and in Ohio law; and the other risk factors LSI describes from time to time in SEC filings. There may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently\nbelieve are immaterial which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nYou are cautioned to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. LSI does not guarantee any forward-looking statement, and actual results may differ materially from\nthose projected.

Gross Margin, operating income, net income, and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of long-term performance-based\ncompensation, severance costs, restructuring costs, consulting expenses supporting commercial growth initiatives, and acquisition costs are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. We exclude these non-recurring items because we believe they are not representative of the ongoing results of operations of our\nbusiness. Also included in this presentation are non-GAAP financial measures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization\n(EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA), Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt. We believe that these are useful as supplemental measures in assessing the operating\nperformance of our business. These measures are used by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results and\nare frequently referenced by those who follow the Company. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other\ncompanies. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have\nlimitations in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures\nshould be used only to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to\nthe net income and earnings per share reported for the periods indicated, along with the calculation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Net\nDebt.\n©2024 LSI INDUSTRIES 10\nNon-GAAP RECONCILIATION\nLSI Industries Q4 2023 Q4 2024 FY 23 FY 24\nNet Sales 123,636 129,007 496,979 469,638\nGross Margin 35,864 33,834 136,945 133,168\nSeverance costs/Restructuring costs\n- -
