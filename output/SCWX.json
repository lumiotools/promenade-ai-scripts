[LockBit](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4270906-1&h=3596854874&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2Fblog%2Flockbit-in-action&a=LockBit):The long established 'top dog' of ransomware groups accounted for 17% of listings, down 8% from last year, proving even further how the takedown has impacted their operations.\n  2. PLAY: The second most active group, PLAY doubled its victim count year-over-year.\n  3. RansomHub: A new group, emerging only a week after the LockBit takedown, is already the third most active group with 7% of the share of victims listed.\n\n\n\nA landscape previously dominated by a few, is now home to a broader set of emerging ransomware players. As smaller groups look to become established, it means there is less repeatability and structure in how they operate and organizations need to continue to remain alert for a wider variety of tactics. This year's median dwell time of 28 hours reflects the newness of these partnerships. While some clusters of groups are executing fast 'smash-and-grab' attacks within hours, others spend hundreds of days in networks in the most extreme cases. As the new ecosystem continues to take shape, we can expect to see further variation and shifts in dwell times and methodology.\n\n**The annual State of the Threat Report examines the cybersecurity landscape from June 2023 to July 2024. Additional key findings include:**\n\n  * Law enforcement activity targeting [GOLD MYSTIC](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4270906-1&h=4141441966&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2Fresearch%2Fthreat-profiles%2Fgold-mystic&a=GOLD+MYSTIC) (LockBit) and [GOLD BLAZER](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4270906-1&h=2576473763&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2Fresearch%2Fthreat-profiles%2Fgold-blazer&a=GOLD+BLAZER) (BlackCat/ALPV) caused significant disruption to the status quo of the ransomware operating landscape.\n  * The number of active ransomware groups using \"**name and shame\" leak sites** grew 30% year-over-year.\n  * Despite this growth in ransomware groups, victim numbers **did not rise at the same pace,** showing a significantly more fragmented landscape posing the question of how successful these new groups might be.\n  * Scan-and-exploit and stolen credentials remain the two largest **initial access vectors** (IAV) observed in ransomware engagements based on our observations.\n  * Observed increase in **adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM)** attacks – a notable and concerning trend for cyber defenders.\n  * **AI is growing in use** and in variation for cybercriminals – expanding the scale and credibility of existing scams like CEO fraud or \"obituary pirates.\"\n\n\n\n**Shifting Sands of Ransomware**\n\n\"Ransomware is a business that is nothing without its affiliate model. In the last year, law enforcement activity has shattered old allegiances, reshaping the business of cybercrime. Originally chaotic in their response, threat actors have refined their business operations and how they work. The result is a larger number of groups, underpinned by substantial affiliate migration,\" said Don Smith, VP Threat Intelligence, Secureworks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU™). \"As the ecosystem evolves, we have entropy in threat groups, but also unpredictability in playbooks, adding significant complexity for network defenders.\"\n\n**AiTM and AI as Growing Threats**\n\nIn the past year, threat actors are increasingly stealing credentials and session cookies to gain access by using [AiTM attacks](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4270906-1&h=2356963981&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2Fresources%2Fwc-inside-the-threat-secureworks-ctu-analysis-episode-3&a=AiTM+attacks). This potentially reduces the effectiveness of some types of MFA, a worrying trend for network defenders. These attacks are facilitated and automated by phishing kits that are available for hire on underground marketplaces and Telegram. Popular kits include Evilginx2, EvilProxy and Tycoon2FA.\n\nAs AI tools have become widespread and readily available, it was inevitable that cybercriminals would take note as they look to scale. Since mid-February 2023, Secureworks CTU researchers have observed an increase in posts on underground forums about OpenAI ChatGPT and how it can be employed for nefarious purposes. Much of the discussion relates to relatively low-level activity including phishing attacks and basic script creation.\n\n\"The cybercrime landscape continues to evolve, sometimes minor, occasionally more significant. The growing use of AI lends scale to threat actors, however the increase of AiTM attacks presents a more immediate problem for enterprises, reinforcing that identity is the perimeter and should cause enterprises to take stock and reflect on their defensive posture,\" continued Smith. \n\nOne novel example of AI being used by threat actors, as observed by Secureworks researchers, was the role it played in a fraud perpetrated by so-called [obituary pirates](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4270906-1&h=1374578224&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2Fblog%2Fare-scammers-using-ai-to-enhance-fake-obituary-sites&a=obituary+pirates). Threat actors monitored Google trends following a death to identify interest in obituaries and then used generative AI to create lengthy tributes on sites that were manipulated to the top of Google search results by SEO poisoning. They then directed users to other sites pushing adware or potentially unwanted programs.\n\n**State-Sponsored Threat Activity – A Summary**\n\nThe report also examines the significant activities and trends in the behavior of state-sponsored threat groups belonging to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. This year, we are also including threat group activity from Hamas, which has seen a notable increase since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, now spilling over into the public domain and our aperture. The primary drivers for these countries are geopolitical.\n\n_China:_\n\nChinese cyber activity has continued to track with previous Secureworks observations. Their aims are broadly focused on information theft for political, economic, and military gain. Much of this activity targeted at industrial sectors that align with the high-level objectives of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Five Year Plan. In October 2023, the heads of the US, UK, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand security agencies warned of the \"epic scale\" of Chinese espionage. State-sponsored threat actors were not immune to the law enforcement activity. In March 2024, the US State Department unsealed indictments against seven named individuals all part of the BRONZE VINEWOOD threat group. The indictments contain details of an extensive campaign of intrusions committed by the group over more than a decade of malicious activity. In the same month, the UK government stated that China was responsible for two malicious campaigns against the UK Electoral Commission between 2021 and 2022. However, no information was released about the group responsible.\n\n_Iran:_\n\nIranian internal and external cyber activity remained driven by its political imperatives. Internationally, Iran primarily focuses on Israel, regional adversaries including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, and the US. Iran makes regular use of fake hacktivist personas to target enemies, allowing itself plausible deniability. There are two primary Iranian sponsors of cyber activity: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).\n\n_North Korea:_\n\nNorth Korean threat actors continued their pursuit of revenue generation via cryptocurrency theft and sophisticated fraudulent employment schemes to gain access to Western jobs. They were persistent in targeting the IT sector and weaknesses in the supply chain. There was a major focus on entities in the US, South Korea, and Japan. These activities were set within the geopolitical context of an increased willingness on the part of North Korea to work with Russia and Iran, with the intent to foster relations with countries that are prepared to confront related, perceived enemies despite international sanctions.\n\n_Hamas:_\n\nSecureworks tracks three threat groups: [ALUMINUM SHADYSIDE](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4270906-1&h=2490183951&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2Fresearch%2Fthreat-profiles%2Faluminum-shadyside&a=ALUMINUM+SHADYSIDE), [ALUMINUM SARATOGA](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4270906-1&h=4138200903&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2Fresearch%2Fthreat-profiles%2Faluminum-saratoga&a=ALUMINUM+SARATOGA) and [ALUMINUM THORN](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4270906-1&h=2634932563&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2Fresearch%2Fthreat-profiles%2Faluminum-thorn&a=ALUMINUM+THORN) considered to be aligned with Hamas, the militant group that governs the Gaza Strip. The outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023 led to an uptick of cyber activity targeted at Israel and countries perceived to be aligned with them. However, much of that activity is thought to have been the work of hacktivist groups and personas masquerading as Palestinian but more likely linked to Iran or Russia.\n\n_Russia:_\n\nThe war in Ukraine continues to drive Russian state-sponsored cyber activity, both in Ukraine and abroad. Groups associated with all three of Russia's intelligence agencies were active throughout the past year. CTU researchers assess that Russia's most aggressive use of cyber capabilities in sabotage operations will remain focused on critical infrastructure targets within Ukraine. One notable example of this kind of activity this year was [IRON VIKING's](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4270906-1&h=2070161309&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2Fresearch%2Fthreat-profiles%2Firon-viking&a=IRON+VIKING%27s) cyber espionage attacks against battlefield control systems used by Ukrainian defense forces.\n\n**State of the Threat Report 2024**\n\nThis 8th edition of Secureworks State of the Threat Report provides a concise analysis of how the global cybersecurity threat landscape has evolved over the last 12 months. The information within the report is drawn from the Secureworks CTU firsthand observations of threat actor tooling and behaviors and includes actual incidents.

The Company has not reconciled its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nAs previously announced, the Company will hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2025 results and financial guidance on September 5, 2024, at 8:00 a.m., Eastern time.

The webcast and supplemental information will be archived at the same location.\n\n**About Secureworks**\n\nSecureworks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a global cybersecurity leader that secures human progress with Secureworks Taegis, a SaaS-based, open XDR platform built on 20+ years of real-world detection data, security operations expertise, and threat intelligence and research. Taegis is embedded in the security operations of thousands of organizations around the world who use its advanced, AI-driven capabilities to detect advanced threats, streamline and collaborate on investigations, and automate the right actions.\n\n[_www.secureworks.com_](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4247271-1&h=1833344431&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.secureworks.com%2F&a=www.secureworks.com)\n\n**Operating Metrics**\n\nWe believe that annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a key operating metric that is useful to measure our business because it is driven by our ability to acquire new subscriptions and expand relationships with existing customers. The Company defines ARR as the value of its subscription contracts as of a particular date. Because the Company uses recurring revenue as a leading indicator of future annual revenue, it includes operational backlog. Operational backlog is defined as the recurring revenue associated with pending contracts, which are contracts that have been sold but for which the service period has not yet commenced.\n\n**Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to determining results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release presents information about our non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP Taegis Subscription Solutions gross profit, non-GAAP Managed Security Services gross profit, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) before income taxes, non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit), non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share before income taxes, non-GAAP net earnings (loss) per share, non-GAAP Taegis Subscription Solutions gross margin, non-GAAP Managed Security Services gross margin, weighted-average shares used in computing non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, diluted, and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures provided as a supplement to the results provided in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance by enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future outlook, while allowing for increased transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operational decision-making. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to each of their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, while not relying on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.\n\nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the financial tables accompanying this press release for each of the fiscal periods presented. As presented in the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" table below, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:\n\n_\"Amortization of Intangible Assets\"_ consists of amortization associated with software development costs capitalized and acquired customer relationships and technology. In connection with the acquisition of Dell by Dell Technologies in fiscal 2014 and our acquisition of Delve Laboratories Inc. in fiscal 2021, our tangible and intangible assets and liabilities associated with customer relationships and technology were accounted for and recognized at fair value on the related transaction date.\n\n_\"Stock-based Compensation Expense\"_ means non-cash, stock-based compensation expense related to the Company's equity plan. We exclude such expenses when assessing the effectiveness of our operating performance since stock-based compensation does not necessarily correlate with the underlying operating performance of the business.\n\n_\"Reorganization and Other Related Charges\"_ means expenses associated with the Company's plan to align its investments more closely with its strategic priorities, as described in further detail in the Company's Form 10-K for fiscal year ended February 2, 2024 as well as in other filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\n**Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Company discusses these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that could affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in the Company's other SEC filings.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the statements in this press release with respect to the Company's expectations regarding revenue, non-GAAP net earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, and total annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\"), total revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, and cash from operations for full year fiscal 2025, all of which reflect the Company's current analysis of existing trends and information.\n\nAny or all forward-looking statements the Company makes may turn out to be wrong and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions the Company might make or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those identified in this press release. These forward-looking statements represent the Company's judgment only as of the date of this press release. The Company does not undertake to update, and expressly disclaims any obligation to update, any of its forward-looking statements, whether resulting from circumstances or events that arise after the date the statements are made, new information, or otherwise.\n\n(Tables follow)\n\n**SECUREWORKS CORP.**  \n---  \nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Related Financial Highlights

(individually and collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Secureworks” or the “Company”) is a\nleading global cybersecurity provider of technology-driven security solutions, singularly focused on protecting the Company’s\ncustomers.\nThe Company has one primary business activity, which is to provide customers with technology-driven cybersecurity solutions.\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-maker, who is the Chief Executive Officer, makes operating decisions, assesses\nperformance, and allocates resources on a consolidated basis. There are no segment managers who are held accountable for\noperations and operating results below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, Secureworks operates its business as a single\nreportable segment.\nOn April 27, 2016, the Company completed its initial public offering, or IPO. Upon the closing of the IPO, Dell Technologies\nInc., or Dell Technologies, owned, indirectly through Dell and its subsidiaries, all shares of the Company’s outstanding Class B\ncommon stock, which as of August 2, 2024, represented approximately 78.9% of the Company's total outstanding shares of\ncommon stock and approximately 97.4% of the combined voting power of both classes of the Company's outstanding common\nstock.\nExcept where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, all references in this report to “Secureworks,” “we,”\n“us,” “our,” and “Company” refer to SecureWorks Corp. and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. References to “Dell”\nrefer to Dell Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to\nconform to current year presentation. Preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make\nassumptions and estimations that affect the amounts reported in the Company’s financial statements and notes. The condensed\nconsolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries.\nIntercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nFor the periods presented, Dell has provided various corporate services to the Company in the ordinary course of business,\nincluding finance, tax, human resources, legal, insurance, IT, procurement, and facilities-related services. The cost of these\nservices is charged in accordance with a shared services agreement, as amended or amended and restated, in part, from time to\ntime, that went into effect on August 1, 2015. For more information regarding related party transactions, see “Note 10—Related\nParty Transactions.”\nRevisions\nThe Company’s historical classification of the effects of exchange rate changes on the Company’s foreign-denominated cash\nand cash equivalents balances was not presented separately as the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\nin the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, but rather was included as a component of net cash\nprovided by (used in) operating activities and investing activities. The Company has revised the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows for each fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024 to correct these classifications. For the six months ended August\n4, 2023, the impact of this correction was a decrease of $2.6 million in net cash used in operating activities and other de\nminimis impacts to cash flows from capital expenditures, as included in total cash used in investing activities. The\ncorresponding amounts are presented separately as the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. These\nrevisions do not impact the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Loss, or the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nThe Company has concluded that the effects of this revision are not material to any of our previously issued financial\nstatements. This revision impacts our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for each fiscal quarter in\nfiscal 2024.\n9\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nFiscal Year\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday closest to January 31. The Company refers to the\nfiscal year ending January 31, 2025 and the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024 as fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively.\nFiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 each consist of 52 weeks and each quarter consists of 13 weeks. Unless otherwise indicated, all\nchanges identified for the current-period results represent comparisons to results for the prior corresponding fiscal periods.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates are revised as additional\ninformation becomes available. In the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, estimates are used when accounting\nfor revenue arrangements, determining the cost of revenue, allocating cost, estimating the impact of contingencies, and\nevaluating long-lived asset impairment. In the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, estimates are used in\ndetermining the valuation and recoverability of assets, such as accounts receivables, inventories, fixed assets, capitalized\nsoftware, goodwill, and other identifiable intangible assets. Estimates are also used in determining the reported amounts of\nliabilities, such as taxes payable and the impact of contingencies. All estimates also impact the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty\nin the current economic environment and impacts of inflation. The Company considered the potential impact of the current\neconomic and geopolitical uncertainties on its estimates and assumptions, and it determined there was not a material impact to\nthe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended August 2, 2024. As\nthe current economic environment and certain geopolitical uncertainties continue to develop, many of the Company’s estimates\ncould require increased judgment and be subject to a higher degree of variability and volatility. As a result, the Company’s\nestimates may change materially in future periods.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has incurred losses from operations and operating cash outflows in recent periods and, as of the balance sheet\ndate, the Company has reported a deficit in working capital.\nThe Company’s prior reorganization actions are expected to result in significant cost savings as the Company completes a\ntransition to higher value, higher margin Taegis solutions. The Company expects that this transition better positions the\nCompany for growth with improving operating margins over time. In the event the Company’s financial results are below its\nexpectations, the Company may need to take additional actions to preserve existing cash reserves.\nAs of August 2, 2024, the Company held $47.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. There were no amounts drawn on the\n$50 million revolving credit facility with Dell as of August 2, 2024. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents\nand access to the revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its cash requirements, including to fund its\nbusiness and meet its obligations, for at least 12 months from the filing date of this report.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nNone.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no significant changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as of and for the three and six months\nended August 2, 2024, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024.\n10\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 2 — LOSS PER SHARE\nLoss per share is calculated by dividing net loss for the periods presented by the respective weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding, and it excludes any dilutive effects of share-based awards that may be anti-dilutive. Diluted net\nloss per common share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, including common stock\nissuable upon the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units. The Company applies the two-class method to calculate\nearnings per share. Because the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock share the same rights in dividends and\nearnings, earnings per share (basic and diluted) are the same for both classes of common stock. Since losses were incurred in all\nperiods presented, all potential common shares were determined to be anti-dilutive.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of loss per common share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nAugust 2, August 4, August 2, August 4,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (14,729) $ (32,359) $ (50,805) $ (63,329)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average number of shares outstanding:\nBasic and Diluted 88,540 86,121 88,026 85,776\nLoss per common share:\nBasic and Diluted $ (0.17) $ (0.38) $ (0.58) $ (0.74)\nWeighted-average anti-dilutive share-based awards 11,028 9,375 9,214 7,117\n11\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 3 — CONTRACT BALANCES AND CONTRACT COSTS\nThe Company derives revenue primarily from subscriptions and professional services. Subscription revenue is derived from (i)\nTaegis software-as-a-service, or SaaS, security platform and supplemental Managed Detection and Response, or MDR,\nservices, and (ii) Managed Security Services. Taegis’ core offerings are the security platform, Taegis Extended Detection and\nResponse, or XDR, and the supplemental MDR service, ManagedXDR. Managed Security Services are subscription-based\narrangements that typically include a suite of security services utilizing the Company’s legacy platform. Professional services\ntypically include incident response, adversarial testing services, and other security consulting arrangements.\nThe following table presents revenue by service type (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nAugust 2, August 4, August 2, August 4,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet revenue:\nTaegis Subscription Solutions $ 71,199 $ 66,426 $ 140,274 $ 129,022\nManaged Security Services 93 10,399 3,239 25,062\nTotal Subscription revenue $ 71,292 $ 76,825 $ 143,513 $ 154,084\nProfessional Services 10,890 16,141 24,321 33,277\nTotal net revenue $ 82,182 $ 92,966 $ 167,834 $ 187,361\nPromises to provide the Company’s subscription-based SaaS solutions are accounted for as separate performance obligations\nand managed security services are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Our subscription contracts typically range\nfrom one to three years. Performance obligations related to the Company’s professional services contracts are separate\nobligations associated with each service. Although the Company has multi-year customer relationships for various professional\nservice solutions, the arrangement is typically structured as a separate performance obligation over the contract period and\nrecognized over a duration of less than one year.\nThe deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription\nagreements. The Company invoices its customers based on a variety of billing schedules. During the six months ended\nAugust 2, 2024, on average, approximately 66% of the Company’s recurring revenue was billed annually in advance and\napproximately 34% was billed on either a monthly or quarterly basis in advance. In addition, many of the Company’s\nprofessional services engagements are billed in advance of service commencement. The deferred revenue balance is influenced\nby several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, billing frequency, and invoice timing.\nChanges to the Company’s deferred revenue during the six months ended August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023 are as follows (in\nthousands):\nUpfront payments\nreceived and billings Revenue recognized\nduring the six months during the six months\nAs of February 2, 2024 ended August 2, 2024 ended August 2, 2024 As of August 2, 2024\nDeferred revenue $ 136,951 $ 115,022 $ (118,706) $ 133,267\nUpfront payments\nreceived and billings Revenue recognized\nduring the six months during the six months\nAs of February 3, 2023 ended August 4, 2023 ended August 4, 2023 As of August 4, 2023\nDeferred revenue $ 156,332 $ 114,112 $ (128,074) $ 142,370\n12\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nRemaining Performance Obligation\nThe remaining performance obligation represents the transaction price allocated to contracted revenue that has not yet been\nrecognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancellable contracts that are expected to be invoiced and recognized as\nrevenue in future periods. The remaining performance obligation consists of two elements: (i) the value of remaining services to\nbe provided through the contract term for customers whose services have been activated, or active; and (ii) the value of\nsubscription-based solutions contracted with customers that have not yet been provisioned, or backlog. Backlog is not recorded\nin revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements until the Company establishes a contractual\nright to invoice, at which point backlog is recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, as appropriate. The Company applies the\npractical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification paragraph 606-10-50-14(a) and does not disclose information about\nremaining performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nThe Company expects that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of its contracts will change from year to year due to\nseveral factors, including the amount invoiced at the beginning of the contract term, the timing and duration of the Company’s\ncustomer agreements, varying invoicing cycles of agreements and changes in customer financial circumstances. Accordingly,\nfluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenues.\nAs of August 2, 2024, the Company expects to recognize remaining performance obligations as follows (in thousands):\nExpected to be\nrecognized in Expected to be Expected to be Expected to be\nthe next 12 recognized in recognized in recognized\nTotal months 12-24 months 24-36 months thereafter\nPerformance obligation - active $ 176,474 $ 111,315 $ 46,648 $ 13,980 $ 4,531\nPerformance obligation - backlog 4,611 2,037 1,394 1,180 —\nTotal remaining performance obligations $ 181,085 $ 113,352 $ 48,042 $ 15,160 $ 4,531\nDeferred Commissions and Fulfillment Costs\nThe Company capitalizes a significant portion of its commission expense and related fringe benefits earned by its sales\npersonnel. Historically, the Company capitalized certain costs to install and activate hardware and software used in its managed\nsecurity services, primarily related to a portion of the compensation for the personnel who perform the installation activities.\nThese deferred costs were amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or\nservices to which the assets relate.\nChanges in the balance of total deferred commission and total deferred fulfillment costs during the six months ended August 2,\n2024 and August 4, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of February 2, 2024 Amount capitalized Amount recognized As of August 2, 2024\nDeferred commissions $ 41,815 $ 3,218 $ (7,559) $ 37,474\nDeferred fulfillment costs — — — —\nAs of February 3, 2023 Amount capitalized Amount recognized As of August 4, 2023\nDeferred commissions $ 49,565 $ 4,225 $ (8,820) $ 44,970\nDeferred fulfillment costs 3,232 — (1,805) 1,427\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Secureworks announced the end-of-sale for a number of managed security service\nofferings effective the first day of fiscal 2023. In addition, renewals associated with many of these existing other managed\nsecurity subscription services were not extended beyond the end of fiscal 2023. Consistent with the end-of-life transition of\nthese non-strategic managed security services, these deferred fulfillment costs were fully amortized as of the end of fiscal 2024,\nand the Company no longer has new deferred fulfillment costs related to these offerings that meet the criteria for capitalization\nin accordance with ASC 340.\n13\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 4 — GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill relates to the acquisition of Dell by Dell Technologies and represents the excess of the purchase price attributable to\nSecureworks over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as subsequent business combinations\ncompleted by the Company. Goodwill decreased $0.3 million due to foreign currency translation for the six months ended\nAugust 2, 2024, compared to February 2, 2024. Goodwill totaled $425.2 million and $425.5 million as of August 2, 2024 and\nFebruary 2, 2024, respectively.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis during the third fiscal quarter of\neach fiscal year, or earlier if an indicator of impairment occurs. The Company completed the most recent annual impairment\ntest in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by performing a \"Step 0\" qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, as\nwell as the Company's indefinite-lived trade name asset at the individual asset level. The Company has one reporting unit. The\nqualitative assessment includes the Company's consideration of the relevant events and circumstances that would affect the\nCompany's single reporting unit and indefinite-lived assets, including macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, the\nCompany's overall financial performance including changes to its cost structure and trends in the market price of the Company's\nClass A common stock. After assessing the totality of these events and circumstances, the Company determined it was not\nmore-likely-than not that the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than their respective\ncarrying values. No triggering events have transpired since the performance of the qualitative assessment that would indicate a\npotential impairment occurred during the period through August 2, 2024.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s intangible assets as of August 2, 2024 and February 2, 2024 were as follows:\nAugust 2, 2024 February 2, 2024\nAccumulated Accumulated\nGross Amortization Net Gross Amortization Net\n(in thousands)\nCustomer relationships $ 189,518 $ (154,672) $ 34,846 $ 189,518 $ (147,624) $ 41,894\nAcquired Technology 141,784 (139,558) 2,226 141,784 (139,042) 2,742\nDeveloped Technology 20,040 (10,926) 9,114 17,070 (8,589) 8,481\nFinite-lived intangible assets 351,342 (305,156) 46,186 348,372 (295,255) 53,117\nTrade name 30,118 — 30,118 30,118 — 30,118\nTotal intangible assets $ 381,460 $ (305,156) $ 76,304 $ 378,490 $ (295,255) $ 83,235\nAmortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was approximately $5.0 million and $9.9 million for the three and\nsix months ended August 2, 2024, respectively, and $8.1 million and $16.1 million for the three and six months ended\nAugust 4, 2023, respectively. Amortization expense is included within cost of revenue and general and administrative expense\nin the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no impairment charges related to intangible assets during\nthe three and six months ended August 2, 2024 or August 4, 2023.\n14\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 5 — DEBT\nRevolving Credit Facility\nSecureWorks, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SecureWorks Corp., is a party to a revolving credit agreement with a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Dell Inc. under which the Company obtained a $50 million senior, unsecured revolving credit facility.\nEffective September 6, 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the revolving credit agreement that was effectuated on\nMarch 23, 2023. This amended agreement (1) increased the maximum principal amount of borrowings outstanding under the\nrevolving credit facility to $50 million, (2) removed the one-time increase of up to an additional $30 million in borrowings\nupon mutual agreement by lender and borrower, (3) extended the commitment and required repayment date under the revolving\ncredit agreement to March 23, 2026, and (4) modified the rate at which interest accrues on funds drawn against the revolving\ncredit agreement to the Secured Overnight Finance Rate, or SOFR, plus 2.00%.\nAmounts under the facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time during the term of the facility. The\nproceeds from loans made under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes. The credit agreement contains\ncustomary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a\ncommitment fee of 0.35%, which is due upon expiration of the facility. There was no outstanding balance under the credit\nfacility, and the Company was in compliance with all covenants, as of August 2, 2024 and February 2, 2024. Additionally, there\nwere no amounts borrowed under the credit facility during the three and six months ended August 2, 2024.\nThe borrower will be required to repay, in full, all of the loans outstanding, including all accrued interest, and the facility will\nterminate upon a change of control of SecureWorks Corp. or following a transaction in which SecureWorks, Inc. ceases to be a\ndirect or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SecureWorks Corp. The facility is not guaranteed by SecureWorks Corp. or its\nsubsidiaries.\n15\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 6 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Contingencies— The Company is periodically involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course\nof business. The Company accrues a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and it can\nreasonably estimate the amount of the loss. The Company reviews the status of such matters at least quarterly and adjusts its\nliabilities as necessary to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant\ninformation. Whether the outcome of any claim, suit, assessment, investigation, or legal proceeding, individually or\ncollectively, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash\nflows will depend on a variety of factors. Such factors include the nature, timing, and amount of any associated expenses,\namounts paid in settlement, damages, or other remedies or consequences. Where new information is later obtained and the\nCompany’s views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, the\nCompany would record changes in accrued liabilities during the period in which such a determination is made. As of August 2,\n2024, the Company does not believe that there were any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCustomer-based Taxation Contingencies—Various government entities, or taxing authorities, require the Company to bill its\ncustomers for the taxes they owe based on the services they purchase from the Company. The application of the rules of each\ntaxing authority concerning which services are subject to each tax and how those services should be taxed involves the\napplication of judgment. Taxing authorities periodically perform audits to verify compliance and include all periods that remain\nopen under applicable statutes, which generally range from three to four years. These audits could result in significant\nassessments of past taxes, fines, and interest if the Company were found to be non-compliant. During the course of an audit, a\ntaxing authority may question the Company’s application of its rules in a manner that, if the Company were not successful in\nsubstantiating its position, could result in a significant financial impact to the Company. In the course of preparing its financial\nstatements and disclosures, the Company considers whether information exists that would warrant disclosure or an accrual with\nrespect to such a contingency.\nAs of August 2, 2024, the Company is under audit with various state taxing authorities in which rulings related to the taxability\nof certain of its services are pending; the Company has recorded an estimated liability of $1.7 million related to such matters.\nThe Company expects to continue to appeal certain of these rulings, but should the Company not prevail, it could be subject to\nobligations to pay additional taxes together with associated penalties and interest for the audited tax period.\nIndemnifications and Guarantees—In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under\nwhich it agrees to indemnify its customers from certain losses incurred by the customer from third-party claims relating to the\nservices performed on behalf of the Company or for certain losses incurred by the customer as to third-party claims arising from\ncertain events as defined within the particular contract. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss\nclauses. Historically, payments related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.\nOther guarantees include guarantees of product and service performance. These contingent obligations are not recognized as\nliabilities and have not had any significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements to date.\nConcentrations—The Company sells solutions to customers of all sizes through a combination of partners and its sales\norganization. During the three and six months ended August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023, the Company had no customer that\nrepresented 10% or more of its net revenue.\n16\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 7 — LEASES\nThe Company’s leases primarily relate to office facilities that have remaining lease terms of 0.4 years to 2.4 years, inclusive of\nrenewal or termination options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.\nThe components of lease expenses were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nAugust 2, August 4, August 2, August 4,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nOperating lease cost $ 563 $ 1,083 $ 1,135 $ 2,164\nVariable lease costs 131 130 255 151\nTotal lease costs $ 694 $ 1,213 $ 1,390 $ 2,315\nSupplemental cash flow information:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of\noperating lease liabilities $ 1,356 1,333 $ 2,711 $ 2,661\nWeighted-average information associated with the measurement of remaining operating lease obligations is as follows:\nAugust 2, 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 2.4 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 5.43 %\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of August 2, 2024 (in thousands):\nFiscal Years Ending August 2, 2024\n2025 $ 2,394\n2026 4,526\n2027 4,088\nThereafter —\nTotal operating lease payments $ 11,008\nLess imputed interest 612\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 10,396\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as part of its actions to rebalance investments cross-functionally in alignment with its\ncurrent strategy and growth opportunities, the Company ceased use of certain corporate office space as a part of its real estate-\nrelated cost optimization actions. The right-of-use asset was assessed to be part of an asset group separate from the Company-\nlevel single asset group. Fair value of the asset was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology considering the\nasset's specific use to generate cash flows. The Company determined the asset values were not recoverable and recorded an\nimpairment loss of $2.9 million to its operating lease right-of-use assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. There were no\nimpairments recorded during the three and six months ended August 2, 2024. See Note 12 —“Reorganization and other related\ncosts” for further discussion.\n17\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 8 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES\nThe SecureWorks Corp. 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the 2016 Plan, provides for the grant of options, stock appreciation\nrights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, whether time-based, performance-based or time- and performance-based, deferred\nstock units, unrestricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, other equity-based awards, and cash bonus awards. Awards may be\ngranted under the 2016 Plan to individuals who are employees, officers, or non-employee directors of the Company or any of its\naffiliates, consultants and advisors who perform services for the Company or any of its affiliates, and any other individual\nwhose participation in the 2016 Plan is determined to be in the best interests of the Company by the compensation committee of\nthe board of directors.\nUnder the 2016 Plan, the Company granted 236,901 and 7,628,617 restricted stock units during the three and six months ended\nAugust 2, 2024, respectively, and 911,705 and 8,053,962 restricted stock units during the three and six months ended August 4,\n2023, respectively. The annual restricted stock units granted during these periods vest over a three-year period. Approximately\n23% and 17% of such awards granted during the six months ended August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023, respectively, are subject\nto performance conditions. The majority of the 7,391,716 restricted stock unit awards made during the three months ended May\n3, 2024 were subject to stockholder approval at the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, which took place on June\n25, 2024, of an amendment to the 2016 Plan. The amendment to the 2016 Plan increased the number of shares of Class A\ncommon stock issuable under the plan by 7,500,000 shares. Such stockholder approval was obtained at the annual meeting, and\nthose awards were deemed granted and outstanding for accounting purposes during the three months ended August 2, 2024.\nThe Company may grant long-term cash awards to certain employees under the 2016 Plan. The cash awards issued during the\nlast three fiscal years are not subject to any performance conditions and vest in equal installments over a three-year period. The\nCompany granted an immaterial amount of cash awards during the three and six months ended August 2, 2024 and August 4,\n2023, respectively. The Company recognized $19.2 thousand and $0.3 million of related compensation expense for the three\nand six months ended August 2, 2024, respectively, and $0.4 million and $1.1 million of related compensation expense for the\nthree and six months ended August 4, 2023, respectively.\n18\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 9 — INCOME AND OTHER TAXES\nThe Company’s loss before income taxes, income tax expense (benefit), and effective income tax rate for the three and six\nmonths ended August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nAugust 2, August 4, August 2, August 4,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLoss before income taxes $ (14,005) $ (41,798) $ (23,876) $ (79,896)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 724 $ (9,439) $ 26,929 $ (16,567)\nEffective tax rate (5.2) % 22.6 % (112.8) % 20.7 %\nOn March 13, 2024, Dell’s economic ownership of the Company dropped below 80%. As a result, the Company no longer\nqualifies for inclusion in Dell Technologies’ consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in certain U.S.\nstate jurisdictions that follow similar consolidation requirements. Commencing with this deconsolidation, the Company will file\nits own consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Given the Company's recent history of cumulative losses, a valuation\nallowance was recorded against its federal deferred tax assets, as well as certain U.S. state deferred tax assets. The Company\nrecorded an initial valuation allowance of $26.2 million during the three months ended May 3, 2024. Net deferred tax balances,\nwhich include the impacts of valuation allowances, are included in other non-current assets and other non-current liabilities in\nthe Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company's effective tax rate was a result of the increase in\nthe valuation allowance partially offset by estimated taxable income for the fiscal year to date.\nFor certain U.S. state jurisdictions where the Company continues to be included in consolidated filings with Dell Technologies,\nrelated deferred tax assets continue to be recognized under the separate return method, modified to apply the benefits-for-loss\napproach. Under the benefits-for-loss approach, net operating losses or other tax attributes are characterized as realized by the\nCompany when those attributes are utilized by other members of the Dell consolidated group.\nDuring the six months ended August 4, 2023, the Company did not file separate federal tax returns as the Company generally\nwas included in the tax grouping of other Dell entities within the respective entity’s tax jurisdiction. The income tax benefit has\nbeen calculated using the separate return method, modified to apply the benefits-for-loss approach. Under the benefits-for-loss\napproach, net operating losses or other tax attributes are characterized as realized by the Company when those attributes are\nutilized by other members of the Dell consolidated group.\nEffective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct\nresearch and development, or R&D, expenses in the year incurred and instead requires taxpayers to capitalize R&D expenses,\nincluding software development cost, and subsequently amortize such expenses over five years for R&D activities conducted in\nthe United States and over fifteen years for R&D activities conducted outside of the United States. This legislation has\nmaterially impacted the Company's deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance.\nAs of August 2, 2024 and February 2, 2024, the Company had a net operating loss receivable from Dell of $5.8 million and\n$5.0 million, respectively. The Company had $4.5 million and $4.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of August 2, 2024\nand February 2, 2024, respectively.\n19\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 10 — RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nAllocated Expenses\nFor the periods presented, Dell has provided various corporate services to Secureworks in the ordinary course of business. The\ncosts of these services are governed by a shared services agreement between Secureworks and Dell Inc. The total amounts of\nthe charges under the shared services agreement with Dell were $0.7 million and $1.4 million for the three and six months\nended August 2, 2024, respectively, and $0.8 million and $1.6 million for the three and six months ended August 4, 2023,\nrespectively. Management believes that the basis on which the expenses have been allocated reasonably reflects the utilization\nof services provided to or the benefit received by the Company during the periods presented.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nFor the periods presented, related party transactions and activities involving Dell Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries were\nnot always consummated on terms equivalent to those that would prevail in an arm’s-length transaction where conditions of\ncompetitive, free-market dealing may exist.\nThe Company purchases computer equipment for internal use from Dell Inc. and its subsidiaries that is capitalized within\nproperty and equipment in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Purchases of computer equipment\nfrom Dell and EMC Corporation, or EMC, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Dell Technologies that provides enterprise\nsoftware and storage, totaled $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and six months ended August 2, 2024, respectively, and\n$0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three and six months ended August 4, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company also recognized revenue related to solutions provided to significant beneficial owners of Secureworks common\nstock, which include Mr. Dell and affiliates of Mr. Dell. The revenues recognized by the Company from solutions provided to\nMr. Dell, MSD Capital, L.P. (n/k/a, DFO Management, LLC, a firm founded for the purposes of managing investments of Mr.\nDell and his family), DFI Resources LLC, an entity affiliated with Mr. Dell, and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation were\nimmaterial to the Company.\nThe Company provides solutions to certain customers whose contractual relationships have historically been with Dell rather\nthan Secureworks, although the Company has the primary responsibility to provide the services. Effective August 1, 2015, in\nconnection with the IPO, Dell transferred many of these customer contracts to the Company, forming a direct contractual\nrelationship between the Company and the end customer. For customers whose contracts have not yet been transferred or whose\ncontracts were subsequently originated through Dell under a reseller agreement, the Company recognized revenues of\napproximately $13.8 million and $27.9 million for the three and six months ended August 2, 2024, respectively, and $14.3\nmillion and $29.3 million for the three and six months ended August 4, 2023, respectively.\nAs the Company’s customer, Dell also purchases services from the Company. The Company recognized revenues from such\npurchases of approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and six months ended August 2, 2024, respectively, and\n$0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three and six months ended August 4, 2023, respectively. For each of the periods\npresented, the majority of these revenues represented professional services revenue.\nAs a result of the foregoing related party arrangements, the Company has recorded the following related party balances in the\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of August 2, 2024 and as of February 2, 2024 (in thousands):\nAugust 2, February 2,\n2024 2024\nRelated party payable (in accrued and other current liabilities) $ 1,756 $ 4,868\nAccounts receivable from customers under reseller agreements with Dell (in accounts\nreceivable, net) $ 7,445 $ 5,748\nNet operating loss tax sharing receivable under agreement with Dell $ 5,784 $ 4,976\n20\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 11 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company measures fair value within the guidance of the three-level valuation hierarchy. This hierarchy is based upon the\ntransparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The categorization of a measurement\nwithin the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three\nlevels are defined as follows:\n• Level 1 - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n• Level 2 - Other observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data\n• Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe assets and liabilities of the Company that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the respective input levels as\nof August 2, 2024 and February 2, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nAugust 2, February 2,\n2024 2024\nLevel 1 Level 1\nCash equivalents - Money Market Funds $ 1,736 $ 1,691\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their\nrespective fair value due to their short-term nature.\n21\nSECUREWORKS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 12 — REORGANIZATION AND OTHER RELATED COSTS\nBeginning in fiscal year ended February 3, 2023, the Company committed to a plan to align its investments more closely with\nits strategic priorities to meet the expected future needs of the business by reducing the Company’s workforce and\nimplementing certain real estate-related and other cost optimization actions. Under this plan and through continued\nreorganization actions, the Company began rebalancing investments cross-functionally in alignment with the Company’s\ncurrent strategy and growth opportunities, such as focusing on the higher value, higher margin Taegis solutions, optimizing the\nCompany’s organizational structure to increase its scalability, and other priorities, to better position the Company for continued\ngrowth with improving operating margins over time. Expenses associated with these actions consisted primarily of severance\nand other termination benefits, real estate-related expenses, and various other cost saving measures. The Company incurred\nexpenses associated with the plan of approximately $1.5 million during the six months ended August 2, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the liability associated with these charges that is included in accrued and other current\nliabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (in thousands):\nReal estate-\nWorkforce related Other Total\nBalance as of February 3, 2023 $ 7,550 $ — $ 1,394 $ 8,944\nReorganization charge 13,873 3,272 — 17,145\nCharges settled in cash (15,802) — (1,394) (17,196)\nCharges settled in non-cash — (3,272) — (3,272)\nBalance as of February 2, 2024 $ 5,621 $ — $ — $ 5,621\nReorganization charge $ 1,476 $ — $ — $ 1,476\nCharges settled in cash (4,194) — — (4,194)\nBalance as of August 2, 2024 $ 2,903 $ — $ — $ 2,903\n22\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis management's discussion and analysis is based upon the financial statements of Secureworks which have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should be read in conjunction\nwith our audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended February 2, 2024 included in Part II, Item 8 of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024 that was filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024, which\nwe refer to as the Annual Report. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-\nlooking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs, and future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially\nfrom those discussed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences\ninclude those discussed in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and in \"Risk Factors\" in Part I,\nItem 1A of our Annual Report, as may be updated in subsequent quarterly reports.\nOur fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday closest to January 31. We refer to the fiscal year ending\nJanuary 31, 2025 and the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024 as fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. Fiscal 2025 and\nfiscal 2024 each consist of 52 weeks, and each quarter consists of 13 weeks. Unless otherwise indicated, all changes identified\nfor the current-period results represent comparisons to results for the prior corresponding fiscal periods.\nAll percentage amounts and ratios presented in this management’s discussion and analysis were calculated using the\nunderlying data in thousands.\nExcept where the context otherwise requires or as otherwise indicated, (1) all references to \"Secureworks,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\"\nand \"our Company\" in this management's discussion and analysis refer to SecureWorks Corp. and our subsidiaries on a\nconsolidated basis, (2) all references to \"Dell\" refer to Dell Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and (3) all\nreferences to \"Dell Technologies\" refer to Dell Technologies Inc., the ultimate parent company of Dell Inc.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global cybersecurity provider of technology-driven solutions singularly focused on protecting our customers.\nOur vision is to be the essential cybersecurity company for a digitally connected world. We believe we are the security platform\nof choice to deliver a holistic approach to security at scale for our customers to achieve their best security outcomes. We\ncombine our considerable experience from securing thousands of customers, for whom we process billions of customer events\nleveraging artificial intelligence and machine-learning in our security platform, with the actionable insights from our team of\nelite researchers, analysts, and consultants to create a powerful network effect that provides increasingly strong protection for\nour customers.\nOur proprietary Taegis security platform utilizes an open architecture that is designed to process a wide variety of telemetry to\nsee security threats quickly and leverage our customers’ existing investments. Our solutions collect and process vast amounts of\ndata across the IT ecosystem by integrating a wide array of proprietary and third-party security products. This open-platform\napproach allows us to aggregate events from a wide range of endpoint, network, cloud, and business systems to increase the\neffectiveness of our solutions.\nBy aggregating and analyzing data from sources around the world, we offer solutions that enable organizations to:\n• prevent security breaches,\n• detect malicious activity,\n• respond rapidly when a security breach occurs, and\n• identify emerging threats.\nWe believe a platform that supports innovation and collaboration enables the power of the security community to outmaneuver\nthe adversary. Leveraging our extensive security expertise and threat intelligence, we utilize our unique insights to extend our\nTaegis XDR platform to defend against cyber-attacks.\nThe integrated approach we have pioneered enables us to deliver a broad portfolio of security solutions to organizations of\nvarying size and complexity. We seek to provide the right level of security for each customer’s particular situation, which\nevolves with our customers as their organizations grow and change over time. Our flexible and scalable solutions secure the\nevolving needs of large enterprises as well as small and medium-sized businesses and U.S. state and local government agencies\nwith limited in-house capabilities and resources.\nWe offer our customers:\n• software-as-a-service, or SaaS, solutions,\n• managed solutions, and\n• professional services, including incident response and adversarial testing services.\n24\nOur security solutions leverage our proprietary technologies, security operations workflows, and extensive expertise and\nknowledge of the tactics, techniques, and procedures of the adversary that we have developed over more than two decades. As\nkey elements of our strategy, we seek to:\n• be the SaaS security platform of choice,\n• broaden our reach with security service providers to deliver our security platform globally, and\n• empower the global security community to beat the adversary at scale.\nTaegis was purpose-built as a SaaS platform that combines the power of artificial intelligence and machine-learning capabilities\nwith actionable security analytics and threat intelligence to unify detection and response across endpoint, network, cloud, email,\nand other systems for better security outcomes and simpler security operations. The Taegis security platform is a core element\nof our SaaS solutions, which leverage workflows designed from our extensive security operations expertise and our integrated\norchestration and automation capabilities to increase the speed of response actions.\nWe offer an integrated suite of technology-driven security solutions enabled by our Taegis security platform and team of highly\nskilled security experts. Our technology-driven security solutions offer an innovative approach to prevent, detect, and respond\nto cybersecurity breaches. The platform collects, aggregates, correlates, and analyzes billions of events daily from our extensive\ncustomer base utilizing sophisticated algorithms to detect malicious activity and deliver security countermeasures, dynamic\nintelligence and valuable context regarding the intentions and actions of cyber adversaries. Through our Taegis solutions, which\nare sold on a subscription basis, we provide global visibility and insight into malicious activity, enabling our customers to\ndetect, respond to, and effectively remediate threats quickly.\nIn addition to our Taegis solutions, we offer a variety of professional services to advise customers on a broad range of security\nand risk-related matters, which include incident response, penetration testing services, and Taegis professional services, that we\nbelieve will accelerate the adoption of our software solutions.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that our sustained success will depend on many factors, including the adoption of our Taegis solutions by\norganizations, continued investment in our technology and threat intelligence research, our introduction of new solutions, our\nability to increase sales of our solutions to new and existing customers, and our ability to attract and retain top talent. Although\nthese areas present significant opportunities, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure we remain successful. We\noperate in an intensely competitive industry and face, among other competitive challenges, pricing pressure resulting from\nactions taken by our larger competitors to reduce the prices of their security prevention, detection, and response solutions, as\nwell as the prices of their managed security services. If we are unable to continue to manage our investments in an efficient\nmanner or to effectively execute our strategies aimed to foster sustained success, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe key factors affecting our performance include the following:\nAdoption of Technology-Driven Solution Strategy. The evolving landscape of applications, modes of communication, and IT\narchitectures makes it increasingly challenging for organizations of all sizes to protect their critical business assets, including\nproprietary information, from cyber threats. New technologies heighten security risks by increasing the number of ways in\nwhich a threat actor can attack a target, giving users greater access to important business networks and information, and\nfacilitating the transfer of control of underlying applications and infrastructure to third-party vendors. An effective security\nstrategy requires the coordinated deployment of a solution across the entire network infrastructure. Our Taegis security\nsolutions are designed to facilitate the successful implementation of such a strategy, but continuous investment in, and\nadaptation of, our technology will be required in the ever-evolving threat landscape. Our financial results will be affected by the\ndegree to which prospective and current customers recognize the mission-critical nature of our technology-driven information\nsecurity solutions and subsequently purchase our solutions.\nInvestment in Our Technology and Threat Intelligence Research. Our software platform serves as the core of our technology-\ndriven security solutions. We believe it provides our customers with an integrated perspective and key visibility into their\nnetwork environments and potential security threats. Our software platform is augmented by threat intelligence from our\nCounter Threat Unit research team, which conducts exclusive research into threat actors, uncovers new attack techniques,\nanalyzes emerging threats, and evaluates the risks posed to our customers. We expect to continue making investments into our\nresearch and development efforts, including remaining on the forefront of threat intelligence so that we can adapt our software\nplatform to new technologies as well as to changes in existing technologies. It is our belief that our performance will be\nsignificantly dependent on our ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving threat landscape, and we believe that continued\ninvestment into our Taegis subscription solutions will contribute to our long-term revenue growth, while the costs of such\ninvestments may continue to adversely affect our prospects for near-term profitability.\n25\nIntroduction of New Security Solutions. Our performance is significantly dependent on our ability to continue to innovate and\nintroduce new information security solutions, such as our Taegis solutions, that protect our customers from an expanding array\nof cybersecurity threats. We intend to continue to invest in security solutions innovation and leadership, including by hiring top\ntechnical talent and focusing on core technology innovation. In addition, we will continue to evaluate and utilize third-party\nproprietary technologies, where appropriate, for the continuous development of complementary offerings. We believe that our\ninvestment in security solutions development will increase the likelihood we will achieve long-term revenue growth, but this\ninvestment may continue to adversely affect our prospects for near-term profitability.\nInvestments in Expanding Our Customer Base.\nEmbracing our Partner Ecosystem. To support future sales, we expect to need to continue to devote resources to developing\nstrategic partnerships with our channel partners, technology alliance partners, and system integrators. We have made, and plan\nto continue making, investments in both marketing and go-to-market efforts with our partners. These investments may not\nresult in increasing revenue or improving our results of operations in the near term, although we do expect both will improve in\nthe long term from these investments.\nDeepening Our Customer Relationships. The continued growth of our business also depends in part on our ability to sell\nadditional solutions to our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of the solutions they previously purchased,\nour portfolio of solutions provides us with a significant opportunity to expand these relationships.\nInvestment in Our People. The difficulty in providing effective information security is exacerbated by the highly competitive\nenvironment for identifying, hiring, and retaining qualified information security professionals. We believe our technology\nleadership, brand, exclusive focus on information security, customer-first culture, and robust training and development program\nenable us to attract and retain highly talented professionals with a passion for building a career in the information security\nindustry. These professionals are led by a highly experienced and tenured management team with extensive IT security\nexpertise and a record of developing successful new technologies and solutions to help protect our customers. We expect to\ncontinue to invest in attracting and retaining top talent to support and enhance our information security offerings.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe use certain operating metrics and our financial results to evaluate our performance and monitor the growth of our business.\nRelevant key operating metrics are presented below as of the dates indicated and for the fiscal periods then ended.\nAugust 2, 2024 August 4, 2023\nTaegis subscription customer base 1,900 2,000\nTotal customer base 3,100 4,500\nTaegis annual recurring revenue (in millions) $ 289.6 $ 275.5\nTotal annual recurring revenue (in millions) $ 289.7 $ 305.8\nTaegis average subscription revenue per customer (in thousands) $ 149.7 $ 135.4\nTotal average subscription revenue per customer (in thousands) $ 149.5 $ 131.2\nTaegis Subscription Customer Base. We define our Taegis subscription customer base as the number of customers who have a\nTaegis subscription agreement as of a particular date.\nTotal Customer Base. We define total customer base as the number of customers that subscribe to our Taegis solutions and\nmanaged security services and customers that buy professional services from us, as of a particular date.\nTotal Annual Recurring Revenue. We define total annual recurring revenue as of the measurement date. Changes to recurring\nrevenue may result from the expansion of our offerings and sales of additional solutions to our existing customers, as well as\nthe timing of customer renewals.\nTotal Average Subscription Revenue Per Customer. We define total average subscription revenue per customer as the average\nannual revenue per customer that subscribes to either our Taegis or other managed security subscription solutions, or both, as of\nthe measurement date. Total average subscription revenue per customer is primarily driven by the persistence of cyber threats\nand the results of our sales and marketing efforts to increase the awareness of our solutions. Our customer composition of both\nenterprise and small and medium sized businesses provides us with an opportunity to expand our professional services revenue.\nAs of each of August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023, approximately 47% of our professional services customers subscribed to our\nTaegis solutions or managed security services.\n26\nNet Revenue Retention Rate. Net revenue retention rate is an important measure of our success in retaining and growing\nrevenue from our subscription-based customers. To calculate our revenue retention rate for any period, we compare the annual\nrecurring revenue of our subscription-based customers at the beginning of the fiscal period, or base recurring revenue, to the\nsame measure from that same cohort of customers at the end of the period, which we refer to as retained recurring revenue. By\ndividing the end-of-period retained recurring revenue by the base recurring revenue from the beginning of the period, we\nmeasure our success in retaining and growing installed revenue from the specific cohort of customers we served at the\nbeginning of the period. Our calculation includes the positive revenue impacts of selling and installing additional solutions to\nthis cohort of customers and the negative revenue impacts of customer attrition during the period. The calculation, however,\ndoes not include the positive impact on revenue from sales of solutions to any customers acquired during the period.\nOur net revenue retention rate remained consistent year-over-year as of August 2, 2024, reflecting the end-of-life transition of\nour non-strategic managed security services which was completed at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Net revenue\nretention rates may increase or decline from period to period as a result of various factors, including the timing of solutions\ninstallations, customer renewal rates, and changes to solution offerings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use supplemental measures of our performance, which are derived from our financial information, but which are not\npresented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\nof America, referred to as GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures presented in this management’s discussion and analysis\ninclude non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP Taegis Subscription Solutions cost of revenue, non-GAAP Managed Security\nServices cost of revenue, non-GAAP subscription cost of revenue, non-GAAP professional services cost of revenue, non-\nGAAP gross profit, non-GAAP Taegis Subscription Solutions gross profit, non-GAAP Managed Security Services gross profit,\nnon-GAAP subscription gross profit, non-GAAP professional services gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP\nTaegis Subscription Solutions gross margin, non-GAAP Managed Security Services gross margin, non-GAAP subscription\ngross margin, non-GAAP professional services gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP research and\ndevelopment expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP\noperating income (loss), non-GAAP income (loss) before income taxes, non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit), non-GAAP\nnet income (loss), non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share before income taxes, non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit) per share,\nnon-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, weighted-average shares used in computing non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, diluted,\nand adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and reorganization and\nother related charges, or adjusted EBITDA. We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information\npresented on a GAAP basis. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to help evaluate our\nfinancial performance and operating results by enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance, while allowing for\nincreased transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operational decision-making\nand enabling more meaningful period-to-period comparisons and comparisons to our peers. Non-GAAP measures have been\nutilized as metrics used to determine variable compensation for employees.\nThere are, however, limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this management’s discussion and\nanalysis. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other\ncompanies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting\nthe usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures we present, as defined by us, exclude the items described in the reconciliation below. As the\nexcluded items can have a material impact on earnings, our management compensates for this limitation by relying primarily on\nGAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures supplementally. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be\nconsidered as indicators of performance in isolation from, or as a substitute for, revenue, subscription revenue, professional\nservices revenue, Taegis Subscription Solutions revenue, Managed Security Services revenue, gross profit, subscription gross\nprofit, professional services gross profit, Taegis Subscription Solutions gross profit, Managed Security Services gross profit,\ncost of revenue, subscription cost of revenue, professional services cost of revenue, Taegis Subscription Solutions cost of\nrevenue, Managed Security Services cost of revenue, operating expense, research and development expenses, sales and\nmarketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, gross margin, subscription gross margin, professional services gross\nmargin, Taegis Subscription Solutions gross margin, Managed Security Services gross margin, operating income (loss), net\nincome (loss), or earnings (loss) per share in accordance with GAAP, and the non-GAAP financial measures should be read\nonly in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\n27\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures for each of the periods presented. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and\nexpenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in our non-GAAP\npresentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.\nThe following is a summary of the items excluded from the most comparable GAAP financial measures to calculate our non-\nGAAP financial measures:\n• Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization associated with software\ndevelopment costs capitalized and acquired customer relationships and technology. In connection with the acquisition\nof Dell by Dell Technologies in fiscal 2014 and our acquisition of Delve Laboratories Inc. in fiscal 2021, our tangible\nand intangible assets and liabilities associated with customer relationships and technology were accounted for and\nrecognized at fair value on the related transaction date.\n• Stock-based Compensation Expense. Non-cash, stock-based compensation expense relates to Secureworks’ equity\nplan. We exclude such expense when assessing the effectiveness of our operating performance since stock-based\ncompensation does not necessarily correlate with the underlying operating performance of the business.\n• Reorganization and other related charges. The aggregate adjustment for expenses associated with the Company's plan\nto align its investments more closely with its strategic priorities, as described in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements—Note 12—Reorganization and Other Related Costs.\n28\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nAugust 2, 2024 August 4, 2023 August 2, 2024 August 4, 2023\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nRevenue:\nTaegis Subscription Solutions $ 71,199 $ 66,426 $ 140,274 $ 129,022\nManaged Security Services 93 10,399 3,239 25,062\nTotal Subscription revenue $ 71,292 $ 76,825 $ 143,513 $ 154,084\nProfessional services 10,890 16,141 24,321 33,277\nTotal revenue $ 82,182 $ 92,966 $ 167,834 $ 187,361\nGAAP gross profit $ 54,737 $ 52,909 $ 112,513 $ 104,518\nAmortization of intangibles 1,433 4,537 2,853 9,017\nStock-based compensation expense 683 531 1,370 1,002\nNon-GAAP gross profit $ 56,853 $ 57,977 $ 116,736 $ 114,537\nGAAP Taegis Subscription Solutions gross profit $ 51,150 $ 45,686 $ 100,794 $ 88,374\nAmortization of intangibles 1,433 1,127 2,853 2,196\nStock-based compensation expense 351 169 617 248\nNon-GAAP Taegis Subscription Solutions gross profit $ 52,934 $ 46,982 $ 104,264 $ 90,818\nGAAP Managed Security Services gross profit $ (924) $ 1,055 $ 837 $ 4,607\nAmortization of intangibles — 3,410 — 6,821\nStock-based compensation expense — 40 48 107\nNon-GAAP Managed Security Services gross profit $ (924) $ 4,505 $ 885 $ 11,535\nGAAP operating loss $ (13,131) $ (41,162) $ (23,798) $ (77,514)\nAmortization of intangibles1 4,957 8,060 9,900 16,064\nStock-based compensation expense2 8,572 7,620 17,541 14,890\nReorganization and other related charges — 14,232 1,476 14,232\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) $ 398 $ (11,250) $ 5,119 $ (32,328)\nGAAP net loss $ (14,729) $ (32,359) $ (50,805) $ (63,329)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 724 (9,439) 26,929 (16,567)\nAmortization of intangibles1 4,957 8,060 9,900 16,064\nStock-based compensation expense2 8,572 7,620 17,541 14,890\nReorganization and other related charges — 14,232 1,476 14,232\nNon-GAAP income (loss) before income taxes (476) (11,886) 5,041 (34,710)\nNon-GAAP income tax expense (benefit)3 (111) (3,266) 1,185 (8,954)\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) $ (365) $ (8,620) $ 3,856 $ (25,756)\nGAAP loss per share $ (0.17) $ (0.38) $ (0.58) $ (0.74)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 0.01 (0.11) 0.31 (0.19)\nAmortization of intangibles 0.06 0.10 0.11 0.19\nStock-based compensation expense 0.10 0.08 0.20 0.17\nReorganization and other related charges — 0.17 0.02 0.17\nNon-GAAP earnings (loss) per share before income taxes $ 0.00 $ (0.13) $ 0.06 $ (0.40)\nNon-GAAP income tax expense (benefit) 0.00 (0.03) 0.01 (0.10)\nNon-GAAP earnings (loss) per share* $ 0.00 $ (0.10) $ 0.04 $ (0.30)\nWeighted-average shares used in computing non-GAAP earnings\n(loss) per share, diluted 88,540 86,121 90,028 85,776\n* Sum of reconciling items may differ from total due to rounding of individual components\n29\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nAugust 2, 2024 August 4, 2023 August 2, 2024 August 4, 2023\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nGAAP net loss $ (14,729) $ (32,359) $ (50,805) $ (63,329)\nInterest and other, net 874 636 78 2,382\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 724 (9,439) 26,929 (16,567)\nDepreciation and amortization 5,547 8,981 11,414 17,961\nStock-based compensation expense 8,572 7,620 17,541 14,890\nReorganization and other related charges — 14,232 1,476 14,232\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 988 $ (10,329) $ 6,633 $ (30,431)\n1 Includes amortization of intangibles as follows:\nCost of revenue $ 1,433 $ 4,537 $ 2,853 $ 9,017\nGeneral and administrative 3,524 3,523 7,047 7,047\n2 Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nCost of revenue $ 683 $ 531 $ 1,370 $ 1,002\nResearch and development 2,769 2,681 6,148 5,283\nSales and marketing 1,476 1,097 2,662 1,938\nGeneral and administrative 3,644 3,311 7,361 6,667\n3 In periods in which the Company has non-GAAP income before tax, the non-GAAP income tax expense is based on the Company's\nestimated blended tax rate.

Upon the closing of our IPO, Dell Technologies owned, indirectly through Dell Inc.\nand Dell Inc.’s subsidiaries, all shares of our outstanding Class B common stock, which as of August 2, 2024 represented\napproximately 78.9% of our total outstanding shares of common stock and approximately 97.4% of the combined voting power\nof both classes of our outstanding common stock. In early March 2024, Dell’s economic ownership of the Company dropped\nbelow 80%. As a result, we no longer qualify for inclusion in Dell Technologies’ U.S. federal income tax return and most U.S.\nstate jurisdictions. For more information, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9—Income and Other Taxes”\nin our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nAs a majority-owned subsidiary of Dell, we receive from Dell various corporate services in the ordinary course of business,\nincluding certain finance, tax, human resources, legal, insurance, IT, procurement, and facilities-related services. The costs of\nthese services have been charged in accordance with a shared services agreement, as amended or amended and restated, in part,\nfrom time to time, that went into effect on August 1, 2015, which is the effective date of our carve-out from Dell. For more\ninformation regarding the allocated costs and related party transactions, see “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements—Note 10—Related Party Transactions” in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nAdditionally, we participate in various commercial arrangements with Dell, under which we, for example, provide information\nsecurity solutions to third-party customers with whom Dell has contracted with to provide our solutions, procure hardware,\nsoftware, and services from Dell, and sell our solutions through Dell in the United States and some international jurisdictions.\nIn connection with our IPO, effective August 1, 2015, we entered into agreements with Dell that govern these commercial\narrangements. In general, these agreements were initially effective for up to one to three years and include extension and\ncancellation options. To the extent that we choose, or are required to transition away from the corporate services currently\nprovided by Dell, we may incur additional non-recurring transition costs to establish our own stand-alone corporate functions.\nFor more information regarding the allocated costs and related party transactions, see “Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements—Note 10—Related Party Transactions” in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in\nthis report.\n31\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sales of our subscriptions and professional services.\n• Subscription Revenue. Subscription revenue primarily consists of subscription fees derived from our Taegis solutions.\nTaegis’ core offerings are the security platform, Taegis XDR, and our supplemental MDR service, ManagedXDR.\nManaged Security Services are other subscription-based arrangements pursuant to which we derive revenue from our\nnon-strategic suite of security services utilizing our legacy platform. Our subscription contracts typically range from\none to three years. The revenue and any related costs for these deliverables are recognized ratably over the contractual\nterm, beginning on the date when the tenant is made available to customers.\n• Professional Services Revenue. Professional services revenue consists primarily of incident response solutions and\nadversarial testing services. Professional services engagements are typically purchased as fixed-fee and retainer-based\ncontracts. Professional services customers typically purchase solutions pursuant to customized contracts that are\nshorter in duration. Revenue from these engagements is recognized under the proportional performance method of\naccounting. Revenue from time- and materials-based contracts is recognized as costs are incurred at amounts\nrepresented by the agreed-upon billing rates. In general, these contracts have terms of less than one year.\nThe fees we charge for our solutions vary based on a number of factors, including the solutions selected, the number of\ncustomer devices covered by the selected solutions, and the level of management we provide for the solutions. In the second\nquarter of fiscal 2025, approximately 87% of our revenue was derived from subscription-based arrangements, attributable to\nTaegis solutions and managed security services, while approximately 13% was derived from professional services\nengagements. As we respond to the evolving needs of our customers, the relative mix of subscription-based solutions and\nprofessional services we provide our customers may fluctuate. International revenue, which we define as revenue contracted\nthrough non-U.S. entities, represented approximately 40% and 38% of our total net revenue in the second quarter fiscal 2025\nand the second quarter fiscal 2024, respectively.\nOver each period presented in this report, our pricing strategy for our various offerings was relatively consistent and did not\nsignificantly affect our revenue growth. We may, however, adjust our pricing to remain competitive and support our strategic\ninitiatives.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of costs incurred to provide subscription and professional services.\n• Cost of Subscription Revenue. Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of personnel-related expenses associated\nwith maintaining our platforms, delivering managed services to our subscription customers, and hosting these\nplatforms. Personnel-related expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and performance-based compensation.\nAlso included in cost of subscription revenue is amortization of equipment and costs associated with hardware utilized\nas part of providing subscription services, amortization of technology licensing fees, amortization of intangible assets,\namortization of external software development costs capitalized, maintenance fees, and overhead allocations. As our\nbusiness grows, the cost of subscription revenue associated with our solutions may fluctuate.\n• Cost of Professional Services. Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of personnel-related expenses,\nsuch as salaries, benefits, and performance-based compensation. Cost of professional services revenue also includes\nfees paid to contractors who supplement or support our solutions, maintenance fees, and overhead allocations. As our\nbusiness grows, the cost of professional services revenue associated with our solutions may fluctuate.\nGross Profit and Margin\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors,\nincluding the mix between our existing solutions, introduction of new solutions, personnel-related costs, and cloud hosting\ncosts. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate depending on these factors; however, we expect them to increase over time with\nexpected growth and a higher mix of Taegis subscription solutions revenue compared to managed security services and\nprofessional services revenue.\n32\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOur operating costs and expenses consist of research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and\nadministrative expenses.\n• Research and Development, or R&D, Expenses. Research and development expenses include compensation and\nrelated expenses for the continued development of our solutions offerings, including a portion of costs related to our\nthreat research team, which focuses on the identification of system vulnerabilities, data forensics, and malware\nanalysis. R&D expenses also encompass expenses related to the development of prototypes of new solutions offerings\nand allocated overhead. Our customer solutions have generally been developed internally. We operate in a competitive\nand highly technical industry; therefore, to maintain and extend our technology leadership, we intend to continue to\ninvest in our R&D efforts by hiring more personnel to enhance our existing security solutions and add complementary\nsolutions.\n• Sales and Marketing, or S&M, Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, and\nperformance-based compensation benefits and related expenses for our S&M personnel, travel and entertainment,\nmarketing and advertising programs (including lead generation), customer advocacy events, and other brand-building\nexpenses, as well as allocated overhead.\n• General and Administrative, or G&A, Expenses. General and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of\nhuman resources and recruiting, finance and accounting, legal support, information management and information\nsecurity systems, facilities management, corporate development, and other administrative functions, and are partially\noffset by allocations of information technology and facilities costs to other functions.\n• Reorganization and other related charges. Reorganization and other related charges consist primarily of severance and\nother termination benefits and real estate-related expenses, as described in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements—Note 12—Reorganization and Other Related Costs.”\nInterest and Other, Net\nInterest and other, net consists primarily of the effect of exchange rates on our foreign currency-denominated asset and liability\nbalances and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. All foreign currency transaction adjustments are\nrecorded as foreign currency gains (losses) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. To date, we have had\nminimal interest income.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) consists of domestic and foreign income taxes. We maintain a valuation allowance for federal and\ncertain state deferred tax assets. Based on our history of losses, we expect to maintain this substantially full valuation allowance\nfor the foreseeable future as it is more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets may not be realized.\nFor a further discussion of income tax matters, see “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 9—Income\nand Other Taxes” in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n33\nResults of Operations\nThree and six months ended August 2, 2024 compared to the three and six months ended August 4, 2023\nThe following tables summarize our key performance indicators for the three and six months ended August 2, 2024 and\nAugust 4, 2023.\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nAugust 2, 2024 August 4, 2023 August 2, 2024 August 4, 2023\n% of % of % of % of\n$ Revenue $ Revenue $ Revenue $ Revenue\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nNet revenue:\nSubscription $ 71,292 86.7 % $ 76,825 82.6 % $ 143,513 85.5 % $ 154,084 82.2 %\nProfessional Services 10,890 13.3 % 16,141 17.4 % 24,321 14.5 % 33,277 17.8 %\nTotal net revenue $ 82,182 100.0 % $ 92,966 100.0 % $ 167,834 100.0 % $ 187,361 100.0 %\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription $ 21,066 29.5 % $ 30,084 39.2 % $ 41,882 29.2 % $ 61,103 39.7 %\nProfessional Services 6,379 58.6 % 9,973 61.8 % 13,439 55.3 % 21,740 65.3 %\nTotal cost of revenue $ 27,445 33.4 % $ 40,057 43.1 % $ 55,321 33.0 % $ 82,843 44.2 %\nTotal gross profit $ 54,737 66.6 % $ 52,909 56.9 % $ 112,513 67.0 % $ 104,518 55.8 %\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 22,804 27.7 % $ 28,236 30.4 % $ 47,352 28.2 % $ 59,408 31.7 %\nSales and marketing 24,512 29.8 % 31,237 33.6 % 48,413 28.8 % 65,763 35.1 %\nGeneral and administrative 20,552 25.0 % 20,366 21.9 % 39,070 23.3 % 42,629 22.8 %\nReorganization and other related charges — — % 14,232 15.3 % 1,476 0.9 % 14,232 7.6 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 67,868 82.6 % $ 94,071 101.2 % $ 136,311 81.2 % $ 182,032 97.2 %\nOperating loss $ (13,131) (16.0) % $ (41,162) (44.3) % $ (23,798) (14.2) % $ (77,514) (41.4) %\nNet loss $ (14,729) (17.9) % $ (32,359) (34.8) % $ (50,805) (30.3) % $ (63,329) (33.8) %\nOther Financial Information (1)\nNon-GAAP cost of revenue:\nNon-GAAP Subscription $ 19,282 27.0 % $ 25,338 33.0 % $ 38,364 26.7 % $ 51,731 33.6 %\nNon-GAAP Professional Services 6,048 55.5 % 9,651 59.8 % 12,734 52.4 % 21,093 63.4 %\nTotal Non-GAAP cost of revenue $ 25,329 30.8 % $ 34,989 37.6 % $ 51,098 30.4 % $ 72,824 38.9 %\nNon-GAAP gross profit $ 56,853 69.2 % $ 57,977 62.4 % $ 116,736 69.6 % $ 114,537 61.1 %\nNon-GAAP operating expenses:\nNon-GAAP research and development $ 20,035 24.4 % $ 25,555 27.5 % $ 41,204 24.6 % $ 54,125 28.9 %\nNon-GAAP sales and marketing 23,036 28.0 % 30,140 32.4 % 45,751 27.3 % 63,825 34.1 %\nNon-GAAP general and administrative 13,384 16.3 % 13,532 14.6 % 24,662 14.7 % 28,915 15.4 %\nNon-GAAP operating expenses $ 56,455 68.7 % $ 69,227 74.5 % $ 111,617 66.5 % $ 146,865 78.4 %\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) $ 398 0.5 % $ (11,250) (12.1) % $ 5,119 3.1 % $ (32,328) (17.3) %\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) $ (365) (0.4) % $ (8,620) (9.3) % $ 3,856 2.3 % $ (25,756) (13.7) %\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 988 1.2 % $ (10,329) (11.1) % $ 6,633 4.0 % $ (30,431) (16.2) %\n(1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, including our reasons for including the measures, material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures, and a reconciliation of each\nnon-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures as a percentage of revenue are\ncalculated based on total GAAP net revenue, except for non-GAAP subscription cost of revenue and non-GAAP professional services cost of revenue\nmeasures, which are calculated based on GAAP subscription net revenue and GAAP professional services net revenue, respectively.\n34\nRevenue\nThe following table presents information regarding our net revenue for the three and six months ended August 2, 2024 and\nAugust 4, 2023.\nThree Months Ended Change Six Months Ended Change\nAugust 2, August 4, August 2, August 4,\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nNet revenue:\nTaegis Subscription Solutions $ 71,199 $ 66,426 $ 4,773 7.2 % $ 140,274 $ 129,022 $ 11,252 8.7 %\nManaged Security Services 93 10,399 (10,306) (99.1) % 3,239 25,062 (21,823) (87.1) %\nTotal Subscription revenue $ 71,292 $ 76,825 $ (5,533) (7.2) % $ 143,513 $ 154,084 $ (10,571) (6.9) %\nProfessional services 10,890 16,141 (5,251) (32.5) % 24,321 33,277 (8,956) (26.9) %\nTotal net revenue $ 82,182 $ 92,966 $ (10,784) (11.6) % $ 167,834 $ 187,361 $ (19,527) (10.4) %\nSubscription Revenue. For the three and six months ended August 2, 2024, subscription revenue decreased $5.5 million, or\n7.2%, and $10.6 million, or 6.9%, respectively. The revenue decrease reflects our continued focus on reducing non-strategic\nservice offerings and prioritizing the growth of our Taegis Subscription Solutions.\nProfessional Services Revenue. For the three and six months ended August 2, 2024, professional services revenue decreased\n$5.3 million, or 32.5%, and $9.0 million, or 26.9%, respectively. The revenue decrease reflects both our focus on reducing non-\nstrategic professional service offerings and an overall decrease of billable hours when compared with fiscal 2024 periods.\nFor the three and six months ended August 2, 2024, international revenue, which we define as revenue contracted through non-\nU.S. entities represented 40% and 39%, respectively. For the three and six months ended August 4, 2023, international revenue\nrepresented 38% and 37% of total revenue, respectively.

For the three months ended August 2, 2024, professional services cost of revenue\ndecreased $3.6 million, or 36.0%. As a percentage of revenue, professional services cost of revenue decreased 320 basis points\nto 58.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, professional services cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased 430 basis points to\n55.5%.

Subscription gross margin increased 9.7% and 10.5% for the three and six months ended August 2,\n2024, respectively. The increase in subscription gross margin is primarily attributable to lower vendor costs as we continue to\nscale the delivery of our higher value, higher margin Taegis Subscription Solutions.\nSubscription gross margin on a GAAP basis includes amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding these adjustments, gross margin increased 6.0% and 6.9% for the three and six months ended\nAugust 2, 2024, respectively.\nProfessional Services Gross Margin. Professional services gross margin increased 3.2% and 10.0% for the three and six months\nended August 2, 2024, respectively. We expect professional services gross margin to fluctuate due to the timing of the revenue\nand related expense reductions associated with the reduction of our non-strategic professional services offerings.\nProfessional services gross margin on a GAAP basis includes stock-based compensation expense.

During the three and six months ended August 2, 2024, the Company incurred\nexpenses of $1.5 million associated with its reorganization plan, consisting primarily of severance and other termination\nbenefits.\n38\nOperating Loss\nOur operating loss for the three months ended August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023 was $13.1 million and $41.2 million,\nrespectively. As a percentage of revenue, our operating loss was 16.0% and 44.3% for the three months ended August 2, 2024\nand August 4, 2023, respectively. The decrease in our operating loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating\nexpenses as a percentage of revenue and was supplemented by increased gross margins driven by our higher value, higher\nmargin Taegis solutions.\nOur operating loss for the six months ended August 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023 was $23.8 million and $77.5 million,\nrespectively. As a percentage of revenue, our operating loss was 14.2% and 41.4% for the six months ended August 2, 2024 and\nAugust 4, 2023, respectively. The decrease in our operating loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses\nas a percentage of revenue and was supplemented by increased gross margins driven by our higher value, higher margin Taegis\nsolutions.\nOperating loss on a GAAP basis includes amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and\nreorganization related costs. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding these adjustments, our non-GAAP operating income was $0.4\nmillion and $5.1 million for the three and six months ended August 2, 2024, respectively, compared to non-GAAP operating\nloss of $11.3 million and $32.3 million for the three and six months ended August 4, 2023, respectively.\nInterest and Other, Net\nInterest and other, net represented expense of $0.9 million and $0.1 million for the three and six months ended August 2, 2024,\nrespectively, compared with net expense of $0.6 million and $2.4 million for the three and six months ended August 4, 2023,\nrespectively. The change primarily reflects the effects of foreign currency transactions and related exchange rate fluctuations.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur income tax expense was $0.7 million, or (5.2)%, and $26.9 million, or (112.8)%, of our pre-tax loss during the three and\nsix months ended August 2, 2024, respectively. Our income tax benefit was $9.4 million, or 22.6%, and $16.6 million, or\n20.7%, of our pre-tax loss during the three and six months ended August 4, 2023, respectively. The change in the effective tax\nrate was primarily attributable to the impact of tax deconsolidation from Dell during the three months ended May 3, 2024.\nAdditionally, the change in effective tax rate was driven by the impact of certain discrete adjustments related to the vesting of\nstock-based compensation awards in the current quarter and the recognition of additional benefits related to research and\ndevelopment credits.\nNet Income (Loss)\nOur net loss of $14.7 million decreased $17.6 million, or 54.5%, for the three months ended August 2, 2024 compared to the\nthree months ended August 4, 2023. Our net loss of $50.8 million decreased $12.5 million, or 19.8%, for the six months ended\nAugust 2, 2024 compared to the six months ended August 4, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to our decreased\noperating loss, partially offset by the impact of income tax expense associated with the tax deconsolidation from Dell during the\nthree months ended May 3, 2024.\nNet loss on a non-GAAP basis for the three months ended August 2, 2024 was $0.4 million compared to non-GAAP net loss of\n$8.6 million for the three months ended August 4, 2023. For the six months ended August 2, 2024, non-GAAP net income was\n$3.9 million compared to non-GAAP net loss of $25.8 million for the six months ended August 4, 2023.\n39\nLiquidity and Capital Commitments\nOverview\nAs of August 2, 2024, we have $47.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and\naccess to the revolving credit facility with Dell, described below, provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our cash\nrequirements, including to fund our business and meet our obligations for at least 12 months from the filing date of this report\nand for the foreseeable future thereafter.\nAs of the balance sheet date, we have reported a deficit in working capital. This deficit in working capital represents an excess\nof our current liabilities over our current assets and is primarily the result of the significant balance of deferred revenue,\nreported as a current liability, as of the balance sheet date. We have, in recent periods, incurred losses from operations and\noperating cash outflows. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our rate of\nrevenue growth, the timing and extent of our expansion into new markets, the timing of introductions of new functionalities and\nenhancements to our solutions, potential acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, continuing market\nacceptance of our solutions, and general economic and market conditions.\nWe expect our recent reorganization actions to result in significant cost savings as we focus on driving growth through our\nhigher value, higher margin Taegis solutions. We believe these efforts will optimize our organizational structure and increase\nscalability to better position us for growth with improving operating margins over time.\nIn the event that our financial results are below our expectations, which may result from the factors mentioned above or other\nfactors, we may need to take additional actions to preserve existing cash reserves. To the extent we undertake future material\nacquisitions, investments, or unanticipated capital or operating expenditures, we may require additional capital or need to incur\nindebtedness. In this context, we regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance our capital structure. In addition to our $50 million\nrevolving credit facility, sources of financing may include arrangements with unaffiliated third parties. The timing, term, size,\nand pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to obtain any such financing on favorable terms or at all.\nSelected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, are set forth below as of the dates indicated.\nAugust 2, February 2,\n2024 2024\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 47,628 $ 68,655\nRevolving Credit Facility\nSecureWorks, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, is party to a revolving credit agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nDell Inc. under which we obtained a $50 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Effective September 6, 2023, the\nrevolving credit agreement was amended and restated to (1) increase the maximum principal amount of borrowings outstanding\nunder the revolving credit facility to $50 million, (2) remove the one-time increase of up to an additional $30 million in\nborrowings upon mutual agreement by the lender and borrower, (3) extend the commitment and required repayment date under\nthe revolving credit agreement to March 23, 2026, and (4) modify the rate at which interest accrues on funds drawn against the\nrevolving credit agreement to SOFR plus 2.00%.\nAmounts under the facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time during the term of the facility. The\nproceeds from loans made under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes. The credit agreement contains\ncustomary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default. The unused portion of the facility is subject to a\ncommitment fee of 0.35%, which is due upon expiration of the facility. There was no outstanding balance under the facility as\nof August 2, 2024 or as of February 2, 2024, and we did not borrow any amounts under the facility during any period covered\nby this report.\nThe borrower will be required to repay, in full, all of the loans outstanding, including all accrued interest, and the facility will\nterminate upon a change of control of SecureWorks Corp. or following a transaction in which SecureWorks, Inc. ceases to be a\ndirect or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SecureWorks Corp. The facility is not guaranteed by us or our subsidiaries.\nFor more information regarding the facility, see “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5—Debt” in\nour condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n40\nCash Flows\nSix Months Ended\nAugust 2, August 4,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet change in cash from:\nOperating activities $ (8,808) $ (67,390)\nInvesting activities (3,994) (2,940)\nFinancing activities (7,010) (5,711)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1,215) (2,577)\nChange in cash and cash equivalents $ (21,027) $ (78,618)\nOperating Activities — Cash used in operating activities totaled $8.8 million and $67.4 million for the six months ended\nAugust 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023, respectively.

The use of cash for the six months ended August 2, 2024 reflected employee\ntax withholding payments on restricted stock awards paid by us of $7.0 million and $5.7 million for the six months ended\nAugust 2, 2024 and August 4, 2023, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of August 2, 2024, we were not subject to any obligations pursuant to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are\nreasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report have been prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP for interim financial information and the requirements of the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all the\ninformation and disclosures required by GAAP for a complete financial statement presentation. The year-end condensed\nbalance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In the\nopinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals and disclosures considered necessary for a fair\ninterim presentation have been included. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAs described in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1—Description of the Business and Basis of\nPresentation” in our consolidated financial statements included in this report, management assessed the critical accounting\npolicies as disclosed in our Annual Report and determined that there were no changes to our critical accounting policies or to\nour estimates associated with those policies during the three and six months ended August 2, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1—Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation”\nin our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of recently issued accounting\npronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our financial statements.\n41\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur results of operations and cash flows have been and will continue to be subject to fluctuations because of changes in global\ninflation and foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the\nBritish Pound, the Romanian Leu, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar, the Indian Rupee and the Canadian Dollar, the\ncurrencies of countries where we currently have our most significant international operations. Our expenses in international\nlocations are generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located.\nAs our international operations grow, we may begin using foreign exchange forward contracts to partially mitigate the impact\nof fluctuations in net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined below under SEC rules, management recognizes\nthat any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of\nachieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible\ncontrols and procedures relative to their cost.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange of 1934, or\nExchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange\nAct is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial\nofficer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nIn connection with the preparation of this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of August 2, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of August 2, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nInternal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures which (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\n(c) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate\nauthorization of management and the board of directors, and (d) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 2, 2024\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n42\nPart II. Other Information\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nWe have discussed risks affecting us under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended February 2, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.

Mr. Toomey,\nplease begin.\nKevin Toomey - SecureWorks Corp - Vice President, Investor Relations\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to the SecureWorks' second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Joining me today are Wendy\nThomas, our Chief Executive Officer; and Alpana Wegner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring this call, unless otherwise indicated, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures.

With that, I'll turn the call over to SecureWorks' CEO, Wendy Thomas.\nWendy Thomas - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nThank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone. Our business continued its strong momentum in the second quarter. Taegis revenue grew 7% year over\nyear to $71 million and we delivered on our Q2 total revenue commitment.\nAnnual recurring revenue or ARR now stands at $290 million, driven by the strength in new customer acquisition and expansion. And our Taegis\naverage revenue per customer or ARPC expanded to $150,000 per customer.\nOur non-GAAP Taegis gross margin of 74% remained strong, growing 360 basis points year over year. And we delivered positive adjusted EBITDA\nonce again this quarter. We are demonstrating that the security outcomes delivered by our Taegis platform.\n2\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

And Taegis is increasingly receiving accolades from\nindustry experts. SecureWorks was recently recognized as the gold winner in the Golden Bridge Awards in the category of AI and cybersecurity\ninnovation. The only company out of more than 1,000 nominated to win this award, a testament to our commitment to excellence and innovation,\nhelping organizations reduce cyber risk and prevent cyber-attacks, by harnessing the power of AI in managed detection and response.\nIn the second quarter, we progressed our growth strategy in several key areas. Specifically, we launched Taegis IDR, our new identity threat detection\nand response solution solving a threat vector that has plagued companies for years and furthering the protection of our customers.\nWe gained traction across our global partner ecosystem, adding new key partners, increasing momentum and sales productivity, and partner win\nrates. And we continue to increase the extensibility of our platform to enable customization of playbooks, integrations, and advanced detectors\nto drive scale in the platform and increasing margins for partners and for us.\nI'll turn to product innovation in the second quarter, starting with a significant product advancement in identity security. First for background, as\ntraditional cyber defenses have hardened, attackers are taking advantage of vulnerable user identities with nearly 80% of breaches involving some\nform of identity compromised in the mix.\nAnd given that identity misconfiguration impact 95% of organizations, the risk here remains high. To put that risk into context, the average cost\nof a data breach reported last year was $4.5 million. In speaking with CISOs, this is often the number one fear that keeps them up at night, one that\nisn't covered by traditional controls such as endpoints.\nThis is why we built and launched Taegis IDR, our identity threat detection and response solution to help security leaders detect, prioritize, and\nrespond to identity-based threats across their organizations environment and on the dark web.\nConventional identity and access management controls like multi-factor authentication are helpful, but insufficient. Taegis IDR provides comprehensive\nattack surface coverage of credential access techniques, providing visibility into identities, monitoring for gaps in the environment, flagging risky\nuser behaviors, alerting when credentials have been exposed on the dark web and detecting and accelerating response to identity-based threats\nin lockstep with Taegis XDR.\nLike all threats, speed is of the essence and these capabilities and a time to detect that's counted in seconds are superior to what we see in the\nmarket today, and these will make a meaningful difference in protecting our customers' environments from one of the most prevalent and lucrative\nattack vectors deployed by threat actors.\nI'm pleased with the feedback from our early adopters on Taegis IDR and the results they are experiencing. Customers appreciate Taegis IDR's\nability to rapidly detect gaps and other missed configurations in their environments, particularly in areas of misconfiguration and vulnerable\nexposures across the Azure and Microsoft ecosystems.\nTaegis IDR ensures customers can close those gaps, while preventing threat actors from accessing and then moving laterally within their network.\nThis quarter, we also launched a more personalized MDR offering with guidance on proactive security posture management and defense called\nTaegis ManagedXDR Plus many organizations struggle to find tailored cybersecurity solutions that fit their unique needs at an affordable price.\nThey often have to settle for a one-size-fits-all approaches that don't offer the proactive defenses they need for resilience. The Taegis Plus offering\naddresses this gap by providing a more targeted threat hunting experience, personalized security health guidance, and customized reporting to\nsupport compliance with a growing set of regulatory requirements.\nWith this offering. We are making good on our commitments to help our customers mature their security posture over time with a clear return on\ntheir investments. This too grows our share of wallet further propelling our industry leading ARPC.\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

This company had a local MSSP relationship that was not providing the capabilities that they needed to address.\nGaps and threat detection were falling on their lean team, which meant they had little to no time to proactively manage the security posture of\ntheir organization in the face of rising cyber-attacks on their business.\nThis customer chose ManagedXDR Plus for the personalized proactive approach to getting ahead of the risks, improving their security posture,\naddressing the regulatory compliance requirements, while scaling their security team all at a meaningful return on investment.\nOur Taegis platform is also supporting our go-to-market momentum, but the industry is experiencing an inflection point in the approach to security\nresilience. We see this in the displacement not only of legacy security technologies, but also in the consolidation of spend on and the number of\ntechnology partners.\nVia our Taegis XDR platform, we are expanding to address a growing set of security use cases such as identity and exposure management. Our\nopen and integrated approach de-risks the consolidation of technologies with full visibility into the efficacy of Taegis endpoint controls, ensuring\nTaegis is well positioned as organizations reevaluate their security investments and resilient strategies.\nOur support of choice means that customers can work within their own time constraints around their technology evolution with optionality to\nevolve their security controls to save vendor spend and management costs at a compelling per endpoint pricing model that has no surprise variable\ndata charges.\nLast quarter, we won a consolidation opportunity with a leading multinational electronics company where the team had invested in multiple\nsecurity products in recent years, but were not seeing the results they had hoped for. Their team was even more overwhelmed with alerts from a\nvariety of costly and unconnected security controls, while facing rising cyber risks to their business.\nThis customer was seeking valid detections and the automation required to scale their existing SecOps team. By consolidating on Taegis, they\nimmediately benefited from fewer, higher fidelity detections with full threat context and automated response capabilities.\nThe ability to seamlessly manage security operations, 24/7 with a predictable and compelling total cost of ownership, led them to make SecureWorks\ntheir global security partner. We also saw great momentum across our global partner ecosystem this quarter, with the addition of new key partners\nand acceleration in our deals won together.\nThis quarter, we expanded the number of partners we have with global reach, while offering all of our partners' strong operating margins, customized\nsales and technical enablement and marketing collaboration.\nThe broader channel increasingly appreciates the competitive advantages that Taegis and the SecureWorks suite of solutions offer, demonstrably\nreducing risk and supporting resilience, increasing the market's recognition that XDR represents the next era in security.\nSupported by the growing success and our partner first go-to-market, we saw increasing momentum in sales productivity with our better together\ngo to market motion in 2Q and our partner win rate improved to the highest level since we launched our partner first go-to-market motion.\nIn Q2, approximately 80% of global Taegis new logo sales closed were partner deals, reflecting the security value Taegis-based solutions bring to\ntheir customers. In the second quarter, we also continued to add to the more than 50 managed security services partners in our program.\nI'll highlight one MSSP partnership signed this quarter with a premier provider of IT and technology solutions. This partner is delivering managed\ndetection and response services powered by the Taegis XDR platform to protect its elite clients across the financial services, life sciences, and\nprofessional services sectors.\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Our agile\nexpansion of features and capabilities to protect against threat actor access vectors, delivering organizations' improved security risk postures and\nthe best security outcomes and are open without compromise approach.\nThese combined with our growing successful partnership ecosystem, put us at an advantage in an environment where vendor consolidation and\nscaling spend on both security technology and talent are top priorities.\nDemand for our Taegis security offerings remains strong. Taegis is the platform of choice for organizations to bolster their security posture at a\nproven return on investment, driving our growth now and into the future. I want to thank you for investing in our mission to secure human progress,\nand thank you to our customers and partners for joining forces with us. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Alpana to cover our financial\nresults and guidance.\nAlpana Wegner - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Wendy. Good morning, everyone. I will review our Q2 results before I provide expectations for Q3 and fiscal year '25. We once again hit\nour financial commitments in Q2. We delivered total revenue exceeding $82 million, which was at the high end of our expectations, primarily on\nthe strength of subscription deals closing earlier in the quarter.\nYear-over-year total revenue growth was impacted by a $13 million decline in revenue from the wind-down of our non-strategic legacy business.\nTaegis subscription revenue was $71 million, up 7% year over year. Total ARR increased 5% year over year to $290 million, in line with our expectations.\nOur ARPC was $150 thousand , up 14% year over year and remains a premium to the industry average, underscoring the value that Taegis provides\nto our customers. The growth in our ARPC was driven by strength in new logo and existing customer expansion.\nWe ended the quarter with 1,900 Taegis customers. We saw new customers added in the quarter at a higher ARPC than the customers that churned.\nAs our Taegis pricing is largely on a per endpoint basis, growth in endpoints is another indicator of platform expansion. Our endpoint count grew\nmore than 9% year over year in the second quarter. Our Q2 operating results were strong, reflecting our continued focus on operational efficiency,\nproductivity improvements, and cost discipline.\nQ2 non-GAAP Taegis subscription gross margin was 74.3%, an improvement of 360 basis points versus second quarter a year ago, driven by\nautomation, continued cloud architecture scaling, and by leveraging our AI and machine learning capabilities across the business.\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 680 basis points to approximately 69% in the quarter. Total gross margins reflect the end-of-life of our\nother MSS business in Q1, resulting in revenue being nearly zero in Q2.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1 million in line with our guidance of $1 to $3 million and an improvement from a loss of $10 million in Q2 of the prior year.\nEBITDA was impacted with more than $1.3 million of redundant or transitional costs associated with the end-of-life of our other MSS business.\nGAAP net loss was $15 million for the second quarter or $0.17 per share compared with GAAP net loss of $32 million or $0.38 per share in the same\nperiod last year. Non-GAAP net income was breakeven or $0.00 per share compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $9 million or $0.10 per share in\nthe same period last year.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

We ended Q2 with a strong balance sheet with $48 million in cash, no debt, and an undrawn\n$50 million credit facility. Our cash flow from operations was $4 million in the quarter compared with $27 million used in the prior year period. The\ndecreased use of our operating cash is driven by our focus on cost discipline, reduction in duplicative costs, and increase in operational efficiencies.\nAs a reminder, our cash flow can fluctuate from quarter to quarter with the first half seasonally being a use of cash, primarily due to the timing of\nannual incentive payouts and the second half typically generating cash from operations.\nNow turning to third quarter and full year fiscal '25 guidance. For Q3 fiscal year '25, we expect total revenue of $80 million to $82 million, adjusted\nEBITDA to be between breakeven and $2 million, and we expect a range of non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.01 to non-GAAP net income per\nshare of $0.01.\nFor the full year fiscal '25, we now expect total ARR to be $300 million or greater total revenue of $328 million to $335 million. Total non-GAAP\ngross margins to be 68%, inclusive of Taegis gross margins to be 74%.\nAdjusted EBITDA to be between $6 million and $12 million, non-GAAP net income per share to be between $0.03 and $0.09, cash flow from\noperations to be between cash used of $2 million and cash generated of $8 million, and we expect CapEx to be in line with fiscal year '24.\nIn closing, our Q2 results give us confidence in our ability to meet our 2025 outlook. We are executing on our growth strategy and will continue to\ndeliver additional value to our customers and partners by opportunistically investing in sales and marketing to accelerate our partner momentum\nand in product development on new and innovative capabilities, both across add-on and native security products. We remain committed to EBITDA\nprofitability as we continue to drive scale in our business.\nThank you for joining us on the call today. Wendy will now rejoin us as we begin Q&A. Operator, can you please introduce the first question?\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\nHamza Fodderwala, Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nHi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe, Wendy, I'll start with you. Obviously, a lot of macro uncertainty out there, but from a\nvery intense threat environment at the same time. I'm wondering, going into your new fiscal year, how are you feeling about the overall macro\nand spending environment? And then maybe, Alpana, for you, how are you feeling about your position from an investment and a sales capacity\nstandpoint to really drive that top line growth sustainably going forward? Thank you.\nWendy Thomas - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nGood morning. Thanks Hamza for the questions. When we look at the marketplace right now, we see continued good demand for cybersecurity\nin general. And then specifically for Taegis, the acceleration in our opportunity around kind of legacy technology displacement vendor consolidation,\nparticularly SIEM replacements, when we look at the sort of macro factors for us, our sales cycles were stable if not slightly better, kind of within\nthe range of recent times. We haven't seen a big shift there.\nAnd frankly, just given where we are in terms of about a little over 18 months into our partner first strategy, we saw really good performance in\nterms of those relationships, this quarter highest win rates, 80% of new sales, increasing mix of deals coming from those partners. So from our\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

To address the second question that you had, just from that investment and sales capacity standpoint, I'd say a couple\nof things there. One is we have done some, as you know, from last year, done some restructuring within our go-to-market organization. And we\ndo feel like we've got the right seller profile today as well as the right capacity to be able to deliver on the top line.\nOur partner ecosystem and as Wendy just said, the positive momentum that we're seeing there is a more efficient go to market. And we do see\nthat, that is generating the capability for us to deliver greater sales productivity.\nThat being said, I do expect that and you saw a little bit of that in Q2 that we'll continue to invest in the go to market as well as products. Those are\ntwo fundamental areas to ensure that we can hit what we want to do from a top line perspective. And from an overall perspective, I'd say sales and\nmarketing where it came in on Q2 as a percentage of revenue is where we expect it to trend for the rest of the year.\nOperator\nMike Cikos, Needham.\nMike Cikos - Needham & Company LLC - Analyst\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. I just wanted to circle back to the prepared remarks. I think there was a comment that some deals\nhad closed earlier in the quarter, which benefited subscription revenues.\nIt doesn't sound like it from a macro standpoint, but just wanted to see like that the positive from that would be, hey, linearity in the quarter\nimproved to a certain degree. It's always to read that negatively. They would say, hey, maybe there was something macro related that may have\nweighed on demand in the back half of the quarter. Can you just clarify that dynamic to make sure that we're all being thoughtful here on that?\nAlpana Wegner - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, it was a positive dynamic from our perspective, which is just typically we see more deals come in at the end of the quarter than at the beginning\nof the quarter. This was just unusual in that we had some larger deals come through at the earlier part of the quarter.\nSo definitely a positive from our perspective and did not necessarily pull away from what we saw towards the end of the quarter.\nMike Cikos - Needham & Company LLC - Analyst\nAnd anything to read as far as potential sustainability for that improved linearity or was this quarter maybe viewed as maybe too early to call it\ntrend just yet?\nAlpana Wegner - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I don't see it as a trend at this point. I would say that it was just a bit of anomaly for that for Q2. Look I admit that CFOs would -- I would love\nto see it happen every quarter on a repetitive basis, but it's a little early to call that as trend.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

And then just a quick follow-up if I could. I know that we were saying how EBITDA this quarter was impacted by those redundant costs, I\nbelieve it was $1.3 million is what you guys had cited. Just as a reminder for the audience, can you help us think about what are the remaining\ntransitional costs from that end of life of other MSS that still need to flush out? How should we think about that over the rest of the year?\nAlpana Wegner - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I'm happy to say that we've got those costs behind us at this point. As you look at the second half of the year, you will see that we've got no\nremaining costs from an legacy business the Other MSS. And as you saw in Q2, the revenue had already come down to a very amount.\nSo that goes to zero as well as the costs. We're at a point where we've transitioned and completed the wind down completely at the end of Q2,\nwhich, as you know, is a pretty significant milestone for us and really enables the team to be focused on purely the go forward, which is very exciting\nfor us.\nWendy Thomas - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nYeah, you didn't ask, but I mean pretty tremendous execution by the team to complete that transition. This is what opens it up for us as a business\nto grow in total revenue and sustain profitability with a business that now has turned towards building go-to-market momentum and investing\nin that as well as new product innovation as we've been able to leverage the platform we've built to take on more security use cases with a lot of\ninvestment that's already been made, so great incremental growth opportunities for us.\nMike Cikos - Needham & Company LLC - Analyst\nTotally understand and excited to see that next chapter for SecureWorks. Thank you, guys.\nOperator\nSaket Kalia, Barclays.\nUnidentified Participant\nHey, thank you. You have Carly on for Saket today, and thank you so much for taking my questions. I think really, I want to focus on some of the\ntrends that we're seeing in industry right now. So first, given the consolidation that we've seen in SIEM market recently, how are you and the team\nthinking about the velocity of some displacements in the industry right now? Is this disruption and creating opportunity for your broader Taegis\nplatform?\nAnd I'd also love to just touch a little bit on that trend that you've been talking about consolidation of spend in the industry, especially on the\nnumber of technology partners from customers, how is Secureworks kind of positioned in that trend, especially now with some of your newer\nproducts to really benefit from that trend of consolidation? Thank you.\nWendy Thomas - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nThanks, Carly. Glad to take that. So I'll speak to the SIEM particularly first, which is that, that has been an opportunity where we've increasingly seen\nour customers are more than ready to move away from noisy hard and expensive to maintain SIEMs to an XDR approach to detection and response.\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

We started building this platform nearly\nseven years ago, now that is a very difficult thing to replicate in terms of the capabilities that we bring to bear to detection and automated response.\nSo that is a trend that for us we will continue to see more and more deals, I believe moving to Taegis as a result. When I think about the consolidation\ntrend, the way we designed the platform was also keeping in mind that essentially niche security products would become features of the platform\nover time.\nAnd we would be able to address with this holistic approach to shielding a customer's entire technology estate with the XDR platform. And our\nIDR launch is a great example of that exposure management, our EDR launch and sort of 2.0 launch of that last quarter.\nThey're all examples of the abilities towards an integrated platform to provide complete protection, but at a really compelling return on investment\nfor customers. So in both the consolidation conversation with native controls as well as the core detection and response capabilities to replace\nSIEMs, we like where we're positioned in the market in terms of those tailwinds.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) [Madeline Brooks], Bank of America.\nMadeline Brooks - BofA Global Research - Analyst\nWendy, this question is for you. There's a lot of positive signals from the quarter like endpoint growth, which is up more than 9%, ARPC is up 14%.\nBut then we're seeing ARR, which -- correct me if I'm wrong -- is majority Taegis is up only 5% and further degradation from last quarter.\nSo I guess can you just help us understand the dynamics of bridging the gap between these really good positive points like the endpoint growth\nand ARPC growth. But for kind of why we're not seeing that reflect in revenue right now, but maybe talk through the net retention or return dynamic\nthat could be impacting that? Thank you.\nWendy Thomas - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nGood morning and thanks for the question. We absolutely see some sort of leading and lagging indicators in terms of different growth vectors,\nand that's why we look across all of them. Endpoint growth is clearly important given the growth in our managed services partner business model,\nwhich is if you recall, is when we really count those as one end customer, but continue to grow revenue, which drives our ARPC and our endpoint\ncount according to those relationships and that's why we continue to kind of break those apart to just give you visibility into the different routes\nto market that we have.\nWhen I think about our ARR growth, we're very confident around the turn we're seeing in getting traction in our partner first model, both in terms\nof the partners we continue to find with global reach -- really high quality, scaled global reach type of partners.\nAnd our investments have increasingly turned towards the enablement and support of those customers. And as we exit 2Q and see that growing\npipeline, as we head into the second half, that definitely underpins our confidence in our ability to see ARR, endpoint and expansion in our ARPC\ncontinue.\nMadeline Brooks - BofA Global Research - Analyst\nAnd maybe just one follow-up question there, too. Has the dynamics in churn have changed as you've gotten to the end of sunsetting your legacy\nbusiness, because we think if I recall correctly there were a lot of customers who were able to transition over to the Taegis platform that was giving\na nice boost to growth? So is that maybe weighing a little bit on growth rates as well as being naturally at the end of that transition period?\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Maybe I'll share a little bit there on what we're seeing from a churn perspective and where our focus is on just from\nour overall retention. To your point, I would say that preponderance of any sort of carryover from transition and the legacy customer bases for the\nmost part behind us at this point.\nWe do see as any normal business would, we do see some levels of attrition across the customer base. From an ARPC standpoint, we did see some\nvariability and what we add from a new customer base being at a higher ARPC and the ones that are churning being at a lower ARPC.\nThere could be some connectivity there that you could make, which is that the lower ARPC from a fit perspective isn't really the sort of market\nsegment that is looking for our type of MDR services. And those often times can be a nice opportunity for us to share and to transfer those over to\nour MSSP partners because they are better suited for what they're offering.\nSo there might be a little bit of overhang there, but we would say the preponderance is sort of behind us. And really for us, the focus from a retention\nstandpoint is around what we see is where we get good retention across our customer bases when we've got good strong, deep relationships,\nwe've got additional ROI and value that we can add to them through our product portfolio, which is much centered on as Wendy shared in her\nprepared remarks, the product portfolio expansion that we are investing in and focused on.\nAnd then at the core is just the constant continuous improvement that we see across our platform and our delivery from a SecOps perspective in\ndetection and response. And that's really underpinned by the automation that you see that we're investing in and seeing some of the benefits of\nthat, not only from what we can do with our customer base in terms of retentiveness, but also it gets a little bit of that benefit, obviously from a\ngross margin perspective as well.\nMadeline Brooks - BofA Global Research - Analyst\nGot it. Just one more ending comment from me here is competitors in your space disclose the number of modules and other products that our\ncustomers are adopting across the base, right? So some disclose three-plus modules, others are disclosing eight-plus modules, any qualitative\ndiscussions around kind of more product adoption would be helpful and maybe going forward would be helpful to see some disclosures as the\nplatform story takes place around the number of products that your customers are adopting. That's it for me. Thanks.\nAlpana Wegner - SecureWorks Corp - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, thank you for that. And certainly, as we think more about the number of products that we're launching, we're in that early stages of that this\nyear. It's definitely on our radar to be able to share that information because we think it will be to your point meaningful for analysts and investors.\nOperator\nThank you. There are currently no further questions at this time. Mr. Toomey, I'd like to turn the call back over to you.\nKevin Toomey - SecureWorks Corp - Vice President, Investor Relations\nGreat. Thank you.
