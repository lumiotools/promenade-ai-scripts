had robust efficacy for total PANSS score,\npositive symptoms, and two measures of function (CGI-S, PSP)\n• In the vocal biomarker positive group, which had moderate to severe negative symptoms,\nbrilaroxazine had robust efficacy for negative symptoms\n• Turn latency measures and human raters’ scale scores cross-validate each other\n• Turn latency provides further support for the

He has contributed significantly to several drug approvals spanning neurology and psychiatry. He has designed,\nimplemented, supervised, and/or conducted >125 CNS and clinical pharmacology clinical trials ranging from first into patient through to proof of concept, implements Asian Bridging\nstrategies, and has overseen large global Phase III registration trials. He is a leader in the use of signal detection and subject strategies to minimize placebo. Dr. Ereshefsky’s contributions,\nfrom the unique perspective of a clinical scientist (clinical psychiatric pharmacist and psychopharmacologist) has supported clinical development planning, PK/PD evaluations, translational\nstrategies, and methodological innovation for Schizophrenia, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Parkinson’s (PD), Alzheimer’s Diseases (AD), and pain indications. He currently focuses on\nstrategies to de-risk early development through proof of concept.\nCurrently he is the Chief Science Officer (CSO) and owner of Follow the Molecule LLC, providing consulting services to pharma, CROs, and technology vendors.
