(“Asset Entities” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ASST)** , a provider of digital marketing and content delivery services across Discord and other social media platforms, and a Ternary Payment Platform company, today announced it has signed an agreement with its Head of Entertainment, Jeff Blue, and has acquired a fifty percent (50%) ownership interest in allfilm, TV, streaming and media rights to Blue’s story,  _One Step Closer: From Xero to #1: Becoming Linkin Park_.\n\nBlue’s inspirational story chronicles how he discovered and developed Linkin Park, overcoming the odds, enduring 44 showcase rejections from almost every record label in the world. Blue served as the band’s music publisher at Zomba Music, Executive Producer of Hybrid Theory, and Vice President of A&R at Warner Bros. Records where he ultimately signed the band. Despite the rollercoaster ride of switching the band’s singer, bass player, three band name changes, and almost being dropped by Blue’s boss, the band’s debut album, Hybrid Theory, remains the biggest-selling debut album of the 21st century.\n\nBlue hired founding member Brad Delson as his intern after meeting Delson at a class Blue taught at UCLA in 1997 and discovered the late Chester Bennington in Phoenix in 1999 and brought him in as the new lead singer. The band ultimately changed their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory, and then to Linkin Park in 2000. Linkin Park is one of the world’s best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide with _Hybrid Theory_ becoming the best-selling debut rock album of the 21st Century.The band has won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three World Music Awards.\n\nPer the agreement, Asset Entities has also engaged with Mr. Blue to write the screenplay, with an anticipated completion date by the end of February 2025. Published by Simon & Schuster/Posthill Press in 2020**,**_One Step Closer: From Xero to #1: Becoming Linkin Park_ has been translated into seven different languages. Most recently, the band announced a massive 2025 worldwide tour in support of its new album, “ _From Zero_ ,” released on November 15, 2024.\n\n“We are thrilled at Asset Entities to finalize this agreement and complete this acquisition,” said Executive Chairman, Michael Gaubert. “Given the amazing worldwide popularity of both Linkin Park and Jeff Blue’s  _One Step Closer_ , we are optimistic that such an inspirational story deserves a film/media adaptation and will be a ‘must-see’ by the many millions of the band’s fans around the world.”\n\nGaubert tells the story of Jeff Blue’s quote about Linkin Park and the album _Hybrid Theory_ becoming such a success, where Blue said, “you never know when your life is going to line up just perfectly enough so you can walk into your own future.”\n\n“Acquiring half of the film, TV, streaming, and media rights to this story, we believe, is an incredible asset that may result in significant revenue for Asset Entities in the future,” said Gaubert.\n\nIndeed, Jeff Blue’s work as a producer and A&R executive in the music industry has resulted in sales of over 160 million albums worldwide, with over 50 signed artists, over 60 publishing deals, and hundreds of film & TV placements.\n\nToday’s news follows Asset Entities’ announcement on October 14, 2024, that it had signed with another Jeff Blue artist Grammy Award-winning R&B and soul singer, songwriter, producer and actress Macy Gray, to **D** esign, **D** evelop, and**M** anage her server on the Discord social community platform.\n\nTo learn about Asset Entities, please go to [www.assetentities.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8ejxhuMgQZ-vEAA-k3TJmvGgp3Wm6HVgXKsxN5WxwjXYn9Dz1DnEjiyXk1szpVzN5ty7ptoKD2lHFJtlCPazdWM6RkDqLkHYuj7SmhvyNgc=).

(“Asset Entities” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ASST)** , a provider of digital marketing and content delivery services across Discord and other social media platforms, and a Ternary Payment Platform company, today announced it has acquired the assets in the TikTok Shop space known as the TikTok Money Machine which includes its Discord community.\n\nThe Discord community teaches content creators how to sell products on TikTok Shop via the use of product content videos. It also connects major consumer product brands with these content creators, offering the latter the opportunity to earn sales commissions, via their TikTok accounts, on each product sale completed. Asset Entities has also secured consulting agreements with TikTokers and lead creators of the Discord, who have an aggregate of 280,000 followers on Instagram and 4,700,000 followers on TikTok.\n\nAs reported by Asset Entities on November 15th, this TikTok transaction comes on the heels of a 237% increase in gross revenues for the period ending September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company expects that the acquisition will add approximately $300,000 a year of additional revenue to the Company and bring Asset Entities into the TikTok Shop market. Through expansion and scalability, the Company believes it can increase existing TikTok Money Machine revenues resulting from the acquisition over the next year.\n\nSince its U.S. launch in September 2023, through the end of September 2024, TikTok Shop has amassed domestic revenue of over $4.6 billion. Currently, more than half of all US-based marketers sell on the platform.1\n\nTikTok Shop enables merchants to sell directly to TikTok users through a suite of in-app shopping touchpoints. The platform’s ecosystem includes a \"Shop\" tab for browsing products, shoppable videos to purchase items from in-feed content, live shopping experiences, an affiliate program where creators and influencers can promote products and earn sales commissions, product tagging within videos, brand storefronts, and a seamless checkout process allowing users to purchase products without leaving the platform. \n\nRecently, TikTok signed a key partnership enabling its users to purchase products from Amazon directly within the TikTok app. TikTok followed up this alliance by signing a deal that allows members of Walmart Connect – that company’s advertising platform – to promote their products through TikTok’s in-feed, native video ad formats.\n\n“We are excited to complete another agreement expanding our share of the Discord community market, especially one allowing us to enter the exploding TikTok Shop market,” said CEO Arshia Sarkhani. “This acquisition is another step in our strategic plan that began with our purchase of the Ternary Payment Processing Platform and OptionsSwing Discord Server last November, and our purchase of Pure Profits and TommyBoyTV this June. We are confident that, like those acquisitions, today’s acquisition will result in a significant increase in our gross revenues. Moving forward, we will continue to explore additional acquisitions accretive to revenue,” he said.\n\nTo learn about Asset Entities, please go to [www.assetentities.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5fTau5WIMxu24V14f0v8X74NBEIjx_MXPQDpBzlPCM02pyfvA8emzFpXq2okmHHj-SzJMonBGWsIubk1UmGi260g4Li5WV55I-08Zl7s6rk=).

(“Asset Entities” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: ASST)** , a provider of digital marketing and content delivery services across Discord and other social media platforms, and a Ternary Payment Platform company, announced today that famed dog behavioralist Jas Leverette, star of the _Netflix_ show _Canine Intervention_ , has selected Asset Entities to **D** esign, **D** evelop and **M** anage his dog training community server on the Discord social community platform, and has entered into an agreement with the Company to collaborate on building a subscription-based digital dog training community on Discord.\n\nThis new digital community will feature personal instruction from Jas and his team at his San Jose, California dog training facility, Cali K9, on such canine skills as obedience, socialization, behavior modification, agility, and puppy training, and will provide dog owners with assorted problem-solving strategies.\n\nConsidered one of today’s most popular dog training media influencers with over 460,000 followers on Instagram and 220,000 followers on TikTok, Mr. Leverette rose to fame in February 2021 when he began hosting _Canine Intervention_ , a worldwide _Netflix_ TV reality show focused on dog training. Throughout the series, which takes place in Oakland, California, Mr. Leverette demonstrates various innovative strategies to resolve a full range of canine obedience issues, including solutions that also adjust the behavior of dog owners. Through his expertise, the show has become celebrated as a useful tool for the thousands of households who love their sometimes-misbehaving pets, but who are unable to afford the services of a professional dog trainer.\n\nHis popularity on _Canine Intervention_ has also led to many other appearances by Jas on such programs as the _Ellen DeGeneres Show_ , _Access Hollywood_, _TMZ_ , _Dr. Phil_ , and numerous news and lifestyle shows.\n\nMr. Leverette’s expertise and engaging personality have enabled him to assemble a star-studded list of celebrity clients. In the sports world, these include Stephen Curry and Jonathan Kuminga of the Golden State Warriors, former Las Vegas Raiders and Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, Pittsburgh Steelers running back Najee Harris, various players from the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams, and two-time former welterweight world champion boxer Andre Berto.\n\nAmong entertainers, Jas currently provides dog training services to Michael B. Jordan, Kevin Hart, Demi Moore, Rico Love, Jason Derulo, Mozzy, Coi Leray, Nef the Pharaoh, Draya Michele, Holly Robinson Peete, and Sage the Gemini. He also works with several Silicon Valley and San Francisco executives, including those from Pacific Gas and Electric, and the San Francisco Mint.\n\n![Jas Leverette from the hit Netflix series](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/c5907dde-2cd0-4a37-ad5c-86f442d5d019/canineintervention.jpg)\n\nBorn in New York, Jas grew up in Oakland, where he began developing his unique brand of body language to communicate with dogs and horses. After becoming a full-time dog and horse trainer and behavior expert, he earned a certification as a PSA (Protection Sports Association) decoy, thereby gaining recognition as an expert evaluator of working dogs’ physical qualities and character traits including stamina, endurance, agility, temperament, ability to handle stress, courage, handler loyalty and the desire to work. Armed with this training, Jas began working with multiple local law enforcement agencies to train their dogs in these essential skills.\n\nToday, after decades of training dogs and horses – as well as dozens of dog trainers themselves -- Jas maintains his passion for his work and love for the process of helping an animal – even ones with the most challenging behavior issues -- overcome their individual traumas and reach their full potential as loyal and loving pets.\n\nAsset Entities Chief Executive Officer, Arshia Sarkhani, added, “Working with a massively popular and engaging personality such as Jas Leverette, we believe, will help make our new digital dog training initiative grow at a rapid pace. We are excited to have Jas join the Asset Entities team.”\n\nTo visit Jas Leverette’s social media pages, please go to:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/calik9/?hl=en](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MuWsQ83OygQGujwJG_QYjrwFFwOqbCD62H6eh2an8Dt2aZgBRAszq4MRZtsGvs1jytM4miprqEQ39uJF-LFs_LSEsO91A2_a0iM0Y6_9GaTi3-J4d8NKdZjGPQ2WtFRSzjV7L4VMbsxkegCiZr2iEQ==)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@CaliK9DogTraining](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MuWsQ83OygQGujwJG_QYjqHZjfltJHbgS56ghvEfLzj6p4WwFhDKMFDOV-SQm0bUaZVFxApq0h5ct72o5jZBPTjUSzoReqZCFS3dYr3YMQGiNRvD2C70b_AZT8gwzoxoYGzBA5bHDDy_PR25RXw4tw==)\n\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@calik9?_t=8itMFWHtgct&_r=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaYYUOfA6WYk1zD__K-pEJZa14CSLMA9jLv2G0a9Oab57eDwkvzVmr9LN3w_aem_R4DRq-Sa4HQQC8u0dnzKOw](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MuWsQ83OygQGujwJG_QYjpUOkQ_YO4XTPL3eVtMxPGU6thcZqN9GYJrp3ZNEGLP3yl3FEoanzf9ftoE9pjKWLlXkMP0v7ee6DmG_NoTnvBV1-EvqNXB_hrSOZr7t_MvbFT9gZqqvJEOwqxJiMNUyrmKrLCivR8ZuvrWqJyXjU5deHmVcqZXsk4IXgKap084LsRPbXIj6ph5N5HwLyM0U-LF819T8paQjDWHEGfYzAEAYa7NvwYowg0lXzjFnJgpET_V5UIKMtbj1pd-cJYYHv-iuzhgMEQszuSb_HkbmUac-jNpl3a6VN8Is4MPoG82ICfrVvm6zk8B0Up-s0YAcOiFmv5JhAtsfy3AStpJzgYwjei-L5ekOs00NYyJCHV0Q4rQOKYxLg8eM0-QZwqifI5Ij3MiWGAaAxYI-kbUE0Yvd5tBAC1x-9kxhPlKF3JKY3KEZqLAinJIV5GcHezdhqVYkOfyzfVJtIg7Ck3pMDKg=)\n\nTo learn about Asset Entities, please go to [www.assetentities.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=x_8Qosu-jkGVEX2QcenNNc90TJFmArbJtgZEnZIiiF2Mkm2w1UUJOWPufLs_c4RvOHix_tIuEYH3AOTG38CJwb9XCa65ri7T5qdaX6ykr35DfAHfkt12lcAR5_rxGf0k2Ns_68OL75uD136IF8pj3LbcSEzg6aKuwi_XgZwsr-_GL55Y-rTWi0ECeyuCzEdMAROh462Nj1rVsBGV8NcqIiLNp9XgWUCzNrXjN6VFS-Hwk3h6tIV9fpOccgSaC23C77wJyo55PDXVmjL3Yy_91vFgW8twBkyZRL-jyDQdS84nXaQ9KUZQY1IyMglByJVG21PT4UFEjsy4I_WZIapGaxxVR14f878kHfWMItsBZo8-_SymtemtnO_b7pnkxYFydg54ex9c62Qlb4wd_uekYsLmE_o8mVaRvpkNeHGm_sDf-7UuG_oPRVqq04kgeFbu).

Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or the Company’s future performance, including its financial performance and projections, growth in revenue and earnings, and business prospects and opportunities.

In evaluating these forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors including those that are described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s periodic reports which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These and other factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements are only predictions.
