The 250,000-square-foot facility serves clients across the United States and is powered by the latest technology, making it a paragon of modern warehouse operations. With AI-driven capabilities like autonomous mobile robotics and advanced logistics, it can achieve 10 times the shipping velocity of traditional IT fulfillment centers. \n\n![Very Narrow Aisle technology at the new Insight Solutions Integration Center in Fort Worth, Texas, turns 40,000 square feet of shelving space effectively into 70,000 square feet of traditional stock space thanks to wire-guided, movable shelves.

Combined with Insight’s Solutions Integration Center in Hanover Park, Illinois, which is strategically located next to one of the biggest U.S. airports, Insight can reach 94 percent of the country via ground shipping. \n\nThe Fort Worth Solutions Integration Center, which also houses on-premises data centers and IT configuration labs, boasts several key features that set it apart from standard fulfillment facilities, including: \n\n  * Warehouse [automation technologies](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insight.com%2Fen_US%2Fwhat-we-do%2Fexpertise%2Fmodern-infrastructure%2Finfrastructure-automation.html&esheet=54148008&newsitemid=20241106863301&lan=en-US&anchor=automation+technologies&index=4&md5=9106648821c3f0a16fcb4a6d83a482bf) orchestrated by [Malin](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malinusa.com%2Fautomation&esheet=54148008&newsitemid=20241106863301&lan=en-US&anchor=Malin&index=5&md5=5ecebe39b21588c2cdc6e9a828d8ed49) ensure efficient product movement through the center. These include automated robotics, conveyor systems, and wire-guided Raymond forklifts in very narrow aisle (VNA) configurations to maximize storage capacity. This ensures that the devices and technology that clients need are always readily available. It also results in precise inventory handling, achieving up to 99 percent accuracy and increasing usable inventory space by 75 percent. \n  * [Geek+ robots](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geekplus.com%2Fshelf-to-person-picking&esheet=54148008&newsitemid=20241106863301&lan=en-US&anchor=Geek%2B+robots&index=6&md5=81e201f080b5af6942dfc110fdcc5d60) accurately and autonomously pick devices every 6 seconds, minimizing collection time and safety risks thanks to 80 percent less foot traffic on the warehouse floor. This also enables rush deployments for clients as assets can be quickly pulled from inventory, configured, and shipped to end users. \n  * Integrated technologies with the use of [Intel® SceneScape](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fdeveloper%2Ftools%2Fscenescape%2Foverview.html&esheet=54148008&newsitemid=20241106863301&lan=en-US&anchor=Intel%26%23174%3B+SceneScape&index=7&md5=20dc5244b2196095629a000c2cef1cfe) drive AI and spatial computing into workflow management. This empowers fast, data-driven decisions without requiring constant cloud connectivity, making it ideal for logistics, manufacturing, and beyond. \n  * A major investment in networking and data center infrastructure enables rapid configuration of more than 3,500 devices simultaneously without degradation. \n\n\n\nSpeaking at the center’s opening, Insight CEO Joyce Mullen said: “Cutting the ribbon today for this facility is a proud milestone for all of us. It’s our latest technology showcase — everything that we've invested in, from the labs and the network infrastructure to the data center and the robotics, is based on partnerships with the world-class technology brands we sell and trust. It’s an exhibition of what we do for our clients and allows us to demonstrate [our solutions](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insight.com%2Fen_US%2Fwhat-we-do%2Fexpertise.html&esheet=54148008&newsitemid=20241106863301&lan=en-US&anchor=our+solutions&index=8&md5=4047719cc5ba09873512ed3b5c9d7b3a) in action.” \n\nFort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker said: “Fort Worth has positioned itself as a key player in the nation’s technological landscape, making our city an ideal hub for companies like Insight to grow and thrive. Insight’s investment underscores Fort Worth’s growing position as a leader in technology and innovation. The state-of-the-art Solutions Integration Center not only showcases the innovative [digital transformation](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insight.com%2Fen_US%2Fwhat-we-do%2Foutcomes.html&esheet=54148008&newsitemid=20241106863301&lan=en-US&anchor=digital+transformation&index=9&md5=90b81dfae3471694826cd2ba42be53e9) work that Insight brings to its clients globally, but also strengthens our local economy by creating new jobs. We are thrilled to welcome this world-class facility and the opportunities it brings to our community.” \n\nInsight’s commitment to sustainability and safety is evident throughout the facility: \n\n  * An energy-efficient design intelligently distributes cooling to the data center and integration labs while minimizing energy consumption in the robotics warehouse space. Consequently, the facility uses 27 fewer air conditioners than comparable logistics and data centers. \n  * As part of its [Insight Flex for Devices](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insight.com%2Fen_US%2Fwhat-we-do%2Fexpertise%2Fdigital-workplace%2Fdevice-as-a-service.html&esheet=54148008&newsitemid=20241106863301&lan=en-US&anchor=Insight+Flex+for+Devices&index=10&md5=503717c43ade1e791d9287aa685bb541) comprehensive device lifecycle care program, the center’s hardware repair and recycling services safely dispose of old devices and reduce e-waste. Insight is one of the only Solutions Integrators certified to handle both in-warranty and out-of-warranty repairs for leading technology brands. Last year alone, Insight’s integration and disposal services helped clients recycle 3.7 million pounds of computer equipment. \n  * AI-powered video security cameras from [Verkada](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verkada.com%2F&esheet=54148008&newsitemid=20241106863301&lan=en-US&anchor=Verkada&index=11&md5=55371e3219755584b0feab4a68d50b86) leverage large language and large vision models to set proactive alerts for different facility events, detect line-crossing into prohibited areas, understand occupancy trends, and more. This results in enhanced inventory control and floor safety, including automatically creating safety corridors through the movable VNA shelving stacks. \n\n\n\n“Our new Solutions Integration Center is a demonstration of the world-class digital transformation solutions we build for our clients,” said Megan Amdahl, senior vice president of client experience and chief operating officer for North America at Insight. “The facility exemplifies modern efficiency and the power of AI to streamline a business. This investment underscores our commitment to providing our clients with smarter and more reliable service, meeting their technology needs faster than ever.\" \n\nTake a virtual tour of Insight’s new Solutions Integration Center at [insight.com/SolutionsIntegrationCenter](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insight.com%2FSolutionsIntegrationCenter&esheet=54148008&newsitemid=20241106863301&lan=en-US&anchor=insight.com%2FSolutionsIntegrationCenter&index=12&md5=aeea60826340ab69cac5bc7329efd5ab).

When referring to non-GAAP measures, the Company refers to them as “Adjusted.” See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information. A tabular reconciliation of financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release. \n\nIn some instances, the Company refers to changes in net sales, gross profit, earnings from operations and Adjusted earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company refers to changes in Adjusted diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. These are also considered to be non-GAAP measures. The Company believes providing this information excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates provides valuable supplemental information to investors regarding its underlying business and results of operations, consistent with how the Company and its management evaluate the Company’s performance. In computing these changes and percentages, the Company compares the current year amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior year amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period. The performance measures excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nThe tax effect of Adjusted amounts referenced herein were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded, adjusted for the effects of valuation allowances on net operating losses in certain jurisdictions. \n\n**GUIDANCE**\n\nFor the full year 2024, we now expect Adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $9.40 and $9.70. We also now expect to deliver mid single-digit gross profit growth and continue to expect that our gross margin will be in the 19% to 20% range. \n\nThis outlook assumes: \n\n  * interest expense of $58 to $60 million; \n  * an effective tax rate of approximately 25.5% for the full year; \n  * capital expenditures of $35 to $40 million; and \n  * an average share count for the full year of 35.1 million shares. \n\n\n\nThis outlook excludes acquisition-related intangibles amortization expense of approximately $70 million, assumes no acquisition or integration related expenses, transformation or severance and restructuring expenses, net and no significant change in our debt instruments or the macroeconomic environment. Due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting some of these types of expenses, which impact net earnings, diluted earnings per share and selling and administrative expenses, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of such expenses, if any, to net earnings, diluted earnings per share and selling and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the full year 2024 forecast. \n\n**CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast today at 9:00 a.m. ET to discuss third quarter 2024 results of operations. A live webcast of the conference call (in listen-only mode) will be available on the Company’s web site at [http://investor.insight.com/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.insight.com%2F&esheet=54145189&newsitemid=20241031036211&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.insight.com%2F&index=1&md5=ea0b33dab3001415fba8f42c22eee4c6), and a replay of the webcast will be available on the Company’s web site for a limited time following the call. To access the live conference call, please register in advance using the event link on the Company's web site. Upon registering, participants will receive dial-in information via email, as well as a unique registrant ID, event passcode, and detailed instructions regarding how to join the call. \n\n**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are referred to as “Adjusted”. Adjusted earnings from operations, Adjusted net earnings and Adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude (i) severance and restructuring expenses, net, (ii) certain executive recruitment and hiring related expenses, (iii) amortization of intangible assets, (iv) transformation costs, (v) certain acquisition and integration related expenses, (vi) gains and losses from revaluation of acquisition related earnout liabilities, (vii) certain third-party data center service outage related expenses and recoveries, and (viii) the tax effects of each of these items, as applicable. Transformation costs represent costs we are incurring to transform our business, to help us achieve our strategic objectives, including becoming a leading solutions integrator. The Company excludes these items when internally evaluating earnings from operations, tax expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the Company and earnings from operations for each of the Company’s operating segments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also includes the impact of the benefit from the note hedge where the Company’s average stock price for the third quarter of 2024 was in excess of $68.32, which is the initial conversion price of our convertible senior notes (the “Convertible Notes”). Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, (iv) amortization of intangible assets, (v) severance and restructuring expenses, net, (vi) certain executive recruitment and hiring related expenses, (vii) transformation costs (viii) certain acquisition and integration related expenses, (ix) certain third-party data center service outage related expenses and recoveries, and (x) gains and losses from revaluation of acquisition related earnout liabilities. Adjusted return on invested capital (“ROIC”) excludes (i) severance and restructuring expenses, net, (ii) certain executive recruitment and hiring related expenses, (iii) amortization of intangible assets, (iv) transformation costs, (v) certain acquisition and integration related expenses, (vi) certain third-party data center service outage related expenses and recoveries, (vii) gains and losses from revaluation of acquisition related earnout liabilities, and (viii) the tax effects of each of these items, as applicable. \n\nThese non-GAAP measures are used by the Company and its management to evaluate financial performance against budgeted amounts, to calculate incentive compensation, to assist in forecasting future performance and to compare the Company’s results to those of the Company’s competitors. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency, facilitate comparisons to prior periods and the Company’s competitors’ results and assist in forecasting performance for future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**FINANCIAL SUMMARY TABLE** **(DOLLARS

Do Not Copy or Distribute. © 2024 Insight Direct USA, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 1\nDisclosures\n◦ Safe harbor statement\nThis presentation includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 related to Insight’s plans and expectations. Statements\nthat are not historical facts, including those related to our expectations about future financial results and the assumptions related thereto, including expectations related to SADA, our\nexpectations regarding supply constraints, our expectations regarding backlog shipments, our expectations regarding future expected trends in the IT market and our opportunities for\ngrowth, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or future events to differ\nmaterially from such statements. Insight Enterprises, Inc. (the \"Company\") undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements, except as\notherwise required by law. More detailed information about forward-looking statements and risk factors is included in today’s press release and discussed in the Company’s most recently\nfiled periodic reports and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n◦ Non-GAAP measures\nThis presentation will reference certain non-GAAP financial information as ‘Adjusted’. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document to our actual GAAP\nresults is attached to the back of this presentation and included in the press release issued today, which you may find on the Investor Relations section of our website at\ninvestor.insight.com. These non-GAAP measures are used by the Company and its management to evaluate financial performance against budgeted amounts, to calculate incentive\ncompensation, to assist in forecasting future performance and to compare the Company’s results to those of the Company’s competitors. The Company believes that these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency, facilitate comparisons to prior periods and the Company’s competitors’ results and assist in\nforecasting performance for future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures\npresented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with\nGAAP.\n◦ Constant currency\nIn some instances, the Company refers to changes in net sales, gross profit, earnings from operations and Adjusted earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North\nAmerica, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company refers to changes in Adjusted diluted earnings per share on a\nconsolidated basis excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. These are also considered to be non-GAAP measures. The Company believes providing this\ninformation excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates provides valuable supplemental information to investors regarding its underlying business and results of\noperations, consistent with how the Company and its management evaluate the Company’s performance. In computing these changes and percentages, the Company compares the\ncurrent year amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior year amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted\naverage translation rate for the current period.\nIInnssiigghhtt PPrroopprriieettaarryy && CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall..

As a Fortune 500-ranked solutions integrator, we enable secure, end-\nto-end digital transformation and meet the needs of our clients through a comprehensive portfolio of\nsolutions, far-reaching partnerships and 36 years of broad IT expertise. We amplify our solutions and\nservices with global scale, local expertise and our e-commerce experience, enabling our clients to realize\ntheir digital ambitions in multiple ways. Our company is organized in the following three operating\nsegments, which are primarily defined by their related geographies:\nOperating Segment Geography\nNorth America United States and Canada\nEMEA Europe, Middle East and Africa\nAPAC Asia-Pacific\nOur offerings in North America and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware,\nsoftware and services, including cloud solutions. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC\nsegments consist largely of software and certain software-related services and cloud solutions.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements\ncontain all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position as of September 30, 2024 and our\nresults of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and cash flows\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2023 was derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet at such date. The\naccompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance\nwith the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and consequently do not include all of the\ndisclosures normally required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nThe results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full\nyear, due in part to the seasonal nature of our business. These unaudited consolidated financial statements\nshould be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, including the related\nnotes thereto, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Insight Enterprises, Inc. and its\nwholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nand disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.\nAdditionally, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of net sales and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we\nevaluate our estimates, including those related to sales recognition, anticipated achievement levels under\npartner funding programs, assumptions related to stock-based compensation valuation, allowances for\ndoubtful accounts, valuation of inventories, litigation-related obligations, valuation allowances for deferred\ntax assets, valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangible assets and goodwill\nand impairment of long-lived assets, including purchased intangibles and goodwill, if indicators of potential\nimpairment exist.\n6\n\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard\nUpdate (\"ASU\") No. 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures\", which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments'\nsignificant expenses on an interim and annual basis. The amendments aim to improve interim disclosure\nrequirements, clarify situations where an entity can reveal multiple segment measures of profit or loss,\nprovide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and include\nother disclosure requirements. The main objective of the amendments is to assist investors in\nunderstanding the entity's overall performance and evaluate potential future cash flows. The guidance is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption being permitted. We did not early adopt this\nguidance. The updated guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated\nfinancial statements or disclosures.\nThere have been no other material changes in, or additions to the recently issued accounting\nstandards as previously reported in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that affect or may affect our\ncurrent financial statements.\n2. Receivables, Contract Liabilities and Performance Obligations\nContract Balances\nThe following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCurrent receivables, which are included in “Accounts receivable,\nnet” $ 3,897,481 $ 3,568,290\nContract assets, net 85,767 120,518\nLong-term accounts receivable 828,465 412,666\nLong-term contract assets, net 105,273 132,780\nContract liabilities, which are included in “Accrued expenses and\nother current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” 114,420 107,217\nSignificant changes in the gross contract assets balances during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):\nContract\nAssets\nBalances at December 31, 2023 $ 272,287\nReclassification of beginning contract assets to receivables, as a result of rights to\nconsideration becoming unconditional (80,520)\nContract assets recognized, net of reclassification to receivables 21,465\nMeasurement period adjustments to acquired contract assets (4,838)\nBalances at September 30, 2024 $ 208,394\nContract assets consist of amounts the Company is entitled to for the resale of third-party\nconsumption-based services, prior to payment becoming unconditional.

As of September 30, 2024,\ncontract assets, net of allowances, were $191,040,000.\nGross contract assets by our internal risk ratings as of September 30, 2024 are summarized as\nfollows (in thousands):\nContract\nAssets\nLow risk $ 38,314\nModerate risk 46,854\nHigh risk 123,226\nTotal contract assets $ 208,394\nChanges in the contract liabilities balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nare as follows (in thousands):\nContract\nLiabilities\nBalances at December 31, 2023 $ 107,217\nReclassification of the beginning contract liabilities to revenue, as the result of\nperformance obligations satisfied (68,993)\nCash received in advance and not recognized as revenue 76,196\nBalances at September 30, 2024 $ 114,420\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of\n$56,429,000 related to its contract liabilities.\nTransaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\nThe following table includes estimated net sales related to performance obligations that are\nunsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of September 30, 2024 that are expected to be recognized in the\nfuture (in thousands):\nServices\nRemainder of 2024 $ 45,266\n2025 78,594\n2026 31,948\n2027 and thereafter 43,328\nTotal remaining performance obligations $ 199,136\nWith the exception of remaining performance obligations associated with our OneCall Support\nServices contracts which are included in the table above regardless of original duration, the remaining\nperformance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less are not included in the\ntable above. Amounts not included in the table above have an average original expected duration of seven\nmonths. Additionally, for our time and material services contracts, whereby we have the right to\nconsideration from a client in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the client of our\nperformance completed to date, we recognized revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice\nas of September 30, 2024 and do not disclose information about related remaining performance obligations\nin the table above. Our time and material contracts have an average expected duration of 27 months.\n8\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe majority of our backlog historically has been, and continues to be, open cancellable\npurchase orders. We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is predictive of future results,\ntherefore we do not include performance obligations under open cancellable purchase orders, which do not\nqualify for revenue recognition, in the table above.\n3. Assets Held for Sale\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we completed the sale of our properties in\nMontreal, Canada and Sheffield, United Kingdom for total net proceeds of approximately $15,476,000. We\nrecognized a net gain on sale of approximately $6,813,000, reported in severance and restructuring\nexpenses, net.\n4. Net Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (\"EPS\") is computed by dividing net earnings available to common\nstockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted\nEPS is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of\ndilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive\npotential common shares include outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and certain shares underlying\nthe Convertible Notes and the warrants relating to the Call Spread Transactions, as applicable. A\nreconciliation of the denominators of the basic and diluted EPS calculations follows (in thousands, except\nper share data):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet earnings $ 58,208 $ 60,247 $ 212,679 $ 190,701\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares used\nto compute basic EPS 32,216 32,574 32,459 33,127\nDilutive potential common\nshares due to dilutive RSUs,\nnet of tax effect 300 278 308 275\nDilutive potential common\nshares due to the Convertible\nNotes 3,258 2,774 3,269 2,533\nDilutive potential common\nshares due to the Warrants 2,557 1,577 2,409 1,214\nWeighted average shares used\nto compute diluted EPS 38,331 37,203 38,445 37,149\nNet earnings per share:\nBasic $ 1.81 $ 1.85 $ 6.55 $ 5.76\nDiluted $ 1.52 $ 1.62 $ 5.53 $ 5.13\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 500 and 10,000, respectively, of our\nRSUs were excluded from the diluted EPS calculations because their inclusion would have been anti-\ndilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 65,000 and 72,000, respectively, of\nour RSUs were excluded from the diluted EPS calculations because their inclusion would have been anti-\ndilutive.\n9\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\n5. Debt, Inventory Financing Facilities, Finance Leases and Other Financing Obligations\nDebt\nOur long-term debt consists of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nABL revolving credit facility $ 262,408 $ 591,500\nSenior unsecured notes due 2032 491,959 —\nConvertible senior notes due 2025 332,434 347,988\nFinance leases and other financing obligations 15 1,033\nTotal 1,086,816 940,521\nLess: current portion of long-term debt (332,439) (348,004)\nLong-term debt $ 754,377 $ 592,517\nOn May 14, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended,\nthe \"credit agreement\") to modify our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “ABL facility”). The\namendment, among other things, releases certain immaterial guarantors from their obligations under the\ncredit agreement. Our maximum borrowing amount under the ABL facility is $1,800,000,000, including a\nmaximum borrowing capacity that could be used for borrowing in certain foreign currencies of\n$350,000,000. From time to time and at our option, we may request to increase the aggregate amount\navailable for borrowing under the ABL facility by up to an aggregate of the U.S. dollar equivalent of\n$750,000,000, subject to customary conditions, including receipt of commitments from lenders. The ABL\nfacility is guaranteed by certain of our material subsidiaries and is secured by a lien on certain of our assets\nand certain of each other borrower’s and each guarantor’s assets. The ABL facility provides for an\nuncommitted first-in, last-out revolving facility in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000. The interest\nrates applicable to borrowings under the ABL facility are based on the average aggregate excess availability\nunder the ABL facility as set forth on a pricing grid in the credit agreement. The ABL facility matures on\nJuly 22, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, eligible accounts receivable and inventory permitted availability\nto the full $1,800,000,000 facility amount, of which $262,408,000 was outstanding.\nThe ABL facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. If\na default occurs (subject to customary grace periods and materiality thresholds) under the credit\nagreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of\ncommitments and required payment of all outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and fees\npayable under the credit agreement.\nSenior Unsecured Notes due 2032\nOn May 20, 2024, we issued $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes\ndue 2032 (the \"Senior Notes\") that mature on May 15, 2032. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured\nobligations of the Company and guaranteed by each of the Company's existing and future direct and\nindirect U.S. subsidiaries that is or becomes a guarantor or borrower under the ABL facility, subject to\ncertain exceptions. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding\nborrowings under the ABL facility. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the \"Senior\nNotes Indenture\") containing certain covenants that limit the Company's ability to, subject to certain\nexceptions, create, incur, or assume liens to secure debt, among other things. The Senior Notes bear\ninterest at an annual rate of 6.625% payable semiannually, in arrears, on May 15th and November 15th of\neach year beginning on November 15, 2024.\n10\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe Company may redeem the Senior Notes prior to May 15, 2027, with an amount equal to the\nnet cash proceeds received by the Company from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to\n106.625% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but\nexcluding, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed\n40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are subject to redemption at\nspecified prices on or after May 15, 2027 plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such notes redeemed,\nto, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to May 15, 2027, the\nCompany may, on one or more occasions, redeem the Senior Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon\nnotice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes plus a “make-whole”\npremium as specified in the Senior Notes Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but\nexcluding, the redemption date.\nIf the Company experiences certain change of control events, together with a ratings decline, as\ndescribed in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase\nsome or all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and\nunpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nThe Senior Notes are subject to certain customary events of default and acceleration clauses. As\nof September 30, 2024, no such events have occurred.\nConvertible Senior Notes due 2025\nIn August 2019, we issued $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (the\n\"Convertible Notes\") that mature on February 15, 2025. The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual\nrate of 0.75% payable semiannually, in arrears, on February 15th and August 15th of each year. The\nConvertible Notes are general unsecured obligations of Insight and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured\nbasis by Insight Direct USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 15, 2024, holders\nof the Convertible Notes could have converted their notes at their option at any time under certain\ncircumstances. Beginning June 15, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day\nimmediately preceding the maturity date, the holders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time,\nregardless of such circumstances.\nThe Convertible Notes mature on February 15, 2025, and we are required to settle the principal\namount of the Convertible Notes in cash. As such, the Convertible Notes balance net of unamortized debt\nissuance costs is classified as a current liability.\nUpon conversion, we will pay cash equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, plus\nshares of our common stock for any additional amounts due. The conversion rate will initially be 14.6376\nshares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial\nconversion price of approximately $68.32 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to\nchange in certain circumstances and will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition,\nfollowing certain events that occur prior to the maturity date or following our issuance of a notice of\nredemption, the conversion rate is subject to an increase for a holder who elects to convert their notes in\nconnection with those events or during the related redemption period in certain circumstances.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change, the holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or\nany portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount\nof the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the\nfundamental change repurchase date. As of September 30, 2024, none of the criteria for a fundamental\nchange or a conversion rate adjustment had been met.\n11\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nAs of September 30, 2024, the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion, including\nthe effect of a fundamental change and subject to other conversion rate adjustments, was 6,460,532.\nIn September 2023, an individual Convertible Note holder exercised their option to convert their\nConvertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $16,895,000, which was settled in January 2024.\nAs a result, the principal amount of the Convertible Notes was settled in cash with additional amounts due\nbeing settled in shares of our common stock.\nThe Convertible Notes are subject to certain customary events of default and acceleration\nclauses. As of September 30, 2024, no such events have occurred.\nThe Convertible Notes consist of the following balances reported within the consolidated balance\nsheets (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nLiability:\nPrincipal $ 333,105 $ 350,000\nLess: debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization (671) (2,012)\nNet carrying amount $ 332,434 $ 347,988\nIn January 2022, we filed an irrevocable settlement election notice with the note holders to\ninform them of our election to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash.\nThe remaining life of the debt issuance cost accretion is approximately 0.37 years. The effective\ninterest rate on the principal of the Convertible Notes is 0.75%.\nInterest expense resulting from the Convertible Notes reported within the consolidated\nstatement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is made up of\ncontractual coupon interest and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nConvertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transaction\nIn connection and concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the\nCall Spread Transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock.\nThe convertible note hedge consists of an option to purchase up to 5,123,160 common stock\nshares at a price of $68.32 per share. The hedge expires on February 15, 2025 and can only be\nconcurrently executed upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes. We paid approximately $66,325,000\nfor the convertible note hedge transaction.\nAdditionally, we sold warrants to purchase 5,123,160 shares of common stock at a price of\n$103.12 per share. The warrants expire on May 15, 2025 and can only be exercised at maturity. The\nCompany received aggregate proceeds of approximately $34,440,000 for the sale of the warrants.\nThe Call Spread Transactions have no effect on the terms of the Convertible Notes and reduce\npotential dilution by effectively increasing the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes to $103.12\nper share of the Company’s common stock.\n12\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nInventory Financing Facilities\nWe have an unsecured inventory financing facility with MUFG Bank Ltd (“MUFG”) for\n$280,000,000. We have maximum availability under our unsecured inventory financing facility with PNC\nBank, N.A. (“PNC”) of $375,000,000, including a $25,000,000 facility in Canada (the \"Canada facility\"). We\nalso have an unsecured inventory financing facility with Wells Fargo in EMEA (the \"EMEA facility\") of\n$50,000,000. The inventory financing facilities will remain in effect until they are terminated by any of the\nparties. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company transitioned the reference rate for invoices issued in\nU.S. Dollars under the PNC facility from LIBOR to the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"Term\nSOFR\") benchmark provisions. If balances are not paid within stated vendor terms (typically 60 days), they\nwill accrue interest at prime plus 2.00% on the MUFG facility, Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average plus\n4.50% on the Canada facility and Term SOFR, EURIBOR, or SONIA, as applicable, plus 4.50% and 0.25%\non the PNC (other than the Canada facility) and EMEA facilities, respectively. Amounts outstanding under\nthese facilities are classified separately as accounts payable – inventory financing facilities in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets and within cash flows from financing activities in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our combined inventory financing facilities had a total maximum\ncapacity of $705,000,000, of which $235,192,000 was outstanding.\n6. Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 22.5%\nand 24.2%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was higher than the United States federal statutory rate of\n21.0% due primarily to state income taxes and higher taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions, partially\noffset by excess tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based compensation, tax benefits\nrelated to research and development activities, and tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain\nacquisition earnout liabilities.\nOur effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 24.7%\nand 25.4%, respectively. Our effective tax rates were higher than the United States federal statutory rate\nof 21.0% due primarily to state income taxes and higher taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions, partially\noffset by excess tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based compensation and tax benefits\nrelated to research and development activities.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had approximately $12,135,000 and\n$13,947,000, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits. Of these amounts, approximately $1,570,000 and\n$1,767,000, respectively, related to accrued interest. In the future, if recognized, the remaining liability\nassociated with uncertain tax positions could affect our effective tax rate. We do not believe there will be\nany changes to our unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months that would have a material effect on\nour effective tax rate.\nWe are currently under audit in various jurisdictions for tax years 2017 through 2022. Although\nthe timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the\nexamination phase of these audits may be concluded within the next 12 months, which could increase or\ndecrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, based on the status of the various\nexaminations in multiple jurisdictions, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be\nmade at this time, but the estimated effect on our income tax expense and net earnings is not expected to\nbe significant.\n13\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\n7. Share Repurchase Program\nOn May 18, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to\n$300,000,000 of our common stock, including $100,000,000 that remained available from prior\nauthorizations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, this repurchase authorization was\nsubstantially exhausted. On September 11, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the\nrepurchase of up to $300,000,000 of our common stock, in addition to any amount that remained from\nprior authorizations. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $300,000,476 remained available for\nrepurchases under our share repurchase plan. Our share repurchases may be made on the open market,\nsubject to Rule 10b-18 or in privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, through 10b5-1 plans\nor otherwise, at management’s discretion. The number of shares purchased and the timing of the\npurchases will be based on market conditions, working capital requirements, general business conditions\nand other factors. We intend to retire the repurchased shares.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 835,188 shares of our\ncommon stock on the open market at a total cost of $165,020,000 (an average price of $197.58 per\nshare). During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we did not repurchase any shares of our\ncommon stock.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,022,545 shares of our\ncommon stock on the open market at a total cost of $200,020,000 (an average price of $195.61 per\nshare). During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 1,633,620 shares of our\ncommon stock on the open market at a total cost of $217,108,000 (an average price of $132.90 per\nshare). All shares repurchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nwere retired.\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nContractual\nIn the ordinary course of business, we issue performance bonds to secure our performance\nunder certain contracts or state tax requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately\n$29,525,971 of performance bonds outstanding. These bonds are issued on our behalf by a surety\ncompany on an unsecured basis; however, if the surety company is ever required to pay out under the\nbonds, we have contractually agreed to reimburse the surety company.\nManagement believes that payments, if any, related to these performance bonds are not\nprobable at September 30, 2024. Accordingly, we have not accrued any liabilities related to such\nperformance bonds in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has a minimum required purchase commitment of approximately $100,467,000\npursuant to an agreement primarily related to cloud services. The total purchase commitment is required to\nbe met or exceeded during a 5-year period, starting October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2028. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 we had a remaining purchase commitment of $81,446,000. If total purchases do not\nmeet the required commitment by September 30, 2028, the shortfall must be prepaid by the Company and\ncan be used for further purchases through September 30, 2029.\nThe Company has a minimum required purchase commitment of approximately $40,000,000\npursuant to an agreement primarily related to software as a service. The total purchase commitment is\nrequired to be met during a 4-year period, starting November 30, 2022 through November 29, 2026. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 we had a remaining purchase commitment of $26,123,000.\n14\n\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe Company has recorded a contingent liability of approximately $21,236,000 payable to a\npartner to settle various contractual commitments to resell a minimum amount of cloud services to clients.\nEmployment Contracts and Severance Plans\nWe have employment contracts with, and severance plans covering, certain officers and\nmanagement teammates under which severance payments would become payable in the event of specified\nterminations without cause or terminations under certain circumstances after a change in control. In\naddition, vesting of outstanding nonvested RSUs would accelerate following a change in control. If\nseverance payments under the current employment agreements or plan payments were to become\npayable, the severance payments would generally range from three to twenty-four months of salary.\nIndemnifications\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements\nunder which we agree to indemnify either our clients or third-party service providers from certain losses\nincurred relating to services performed on our behalf or for losses arising from defined events, which may\ninclude litigation or claims relating to past performance. These arrangements include, but are not limited\nto, the indemnification of our clients for certain claims arising out of our performance under our sales\ncontracts, the indemnification of our landlords for certain claims arising from our use of leased facilities and\nthe indemnification of the lenders that provide our credit facilities for certain claims arising from their\nextension of credit to us. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.\nManagement believes that payments, if any, related to these indemnifications are not probable\nat September 30, 2024. Accordingly, we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in\nour consolidated financial statements.\nWe have entered into separate indemnification agreements with certain of our executive officers\nand with each of our directors. These agreements require us, among other requirements, to indemnify such\nofficers and directors against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments and settlements incurred by\nsuch individual in connection with any action arising out of such individual’s status or service as our\nexecutive officer or director (subject to exceptions such as where the individual failed to act in good faith or\nin a manner the individual reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the\nCompany) and to advance expenses incurred by such individual with respect to which such individual may\nbe entitled to indemnification by us. There are no pending legal proceedings that involve the\nindemnification of any of the Company’s directors or officers.\nContingencies Related to Third-Party Review\nFrom time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We\nare also subject to various governmental, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not\nsuch claims have merit and warrant accrual. Where appropriate, we accrue estimates of anticipated\nliabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our\nresults of operations and our cash flows.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are party to various legal proceedings incidental to the business, including\npreference payment claims asserted in client bankruptcy proceedings, indemnification claims, claims of\nalleged infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, employment\nclaims, claims related to services provided, interruptions, or outages, claims of alleged non-compliance\nwith contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. We regularly\nevaluate the status of the legal\n15\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nproceedings in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable\npossibility that a loss, or an additional loss, may have been incurred and determine if accruals are required.\nIf accruals are not required, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of\npossible loss or range of possible loss can be made. Although litigation is inherently unpredictable, we\nbelieve that we have adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses. It is possible,\nnevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity could be materially\nand adversely affected in any particular period by the work required pursuant to any legal proceedings or\nthe resolution of any legal proceedings during such period. Legal expenses related to defense of any legal\nproceeding or the negotiations, settlements, rulings and advice of outside legal counsel in connection with\nany legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.\n9.

Charges are allocated to our operating segments, and the allocations have been\ndetermined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided\nto or benefits received by the operating segments.\n18\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following tables present our results of operations by reportable operating segment for the\nperiods indicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNorth\nAmerica EMEA APAC Consolidated\nNet sales:\nProducts $ 1,391,176 $ 249,642 $ 32,961 $ 1,673,779\nServices 325,407 62,964 25,736 414,107\nTotal net sales 1,716,583 312,606 58,697 2,087,886\nCosts of goods sold:\nProducts 1,237,012 219,573 29,686 1,486,271\nServices 131,514 26,652 11,364 169,530\nTotal costs of goods sold 1,368,526 246,225 41,050 1,655,801\nGross profit 348,057 66,381 17,647 432,085\nOperating expenses:\nSelling and administrative expenses 259,954 57,808 12,234 329,996\nSeverance and restructuring\nexpenses 7,242 1,240 61 8,543\nAcquisition and integration related\nexpenses 25 668 2 695\nEarnings from operations $ 80,836 $ 6,665 $ 5,350 $ 92,851\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNorth\nAmerica EMEA APAC Consolidated\nNet sales:\nProducts $ 1,562,861 $ 300,485 $ 26,808 $ 1,890,154\nServices 298,011 53,911 24,210 376,132\nTotal net sales 1,860,872 354,396 51,018 2,266,286\nCosts of goods sold:\nProducts 1,401,472 272,083 23,988 1,697,543\nServices 125,543 22,604 11,726 159,873\nTotal costs of goods sold 1,527,015 294,687 35,714 1,857,416\nGross profit 333,857 59,709 15,304 408,870\nOperating expenses:\nSelling and administrative expenses 244,154 54,435 11,204 309,793\nSeverance and restructuring\nexpenses, net 2,650 271 2 2,923\nAcquisition and integration related\nexpenses 970 3,322 — 4,292\nEarnings from operations $ 86,083 $ 1,681 $ 4,098 $ 91,862\n19\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNorth\nAmerica EMEA APAC Consolidated\nNet sales:\nProducts $ 4,380,214 $ 881,464 $ 102,491 $ 5,364,169\nServices 973,548 212,856 78,460 1,264,864\nTotal net sales 5,353,762 1,094,320 180,951 6,629,033\nCosts of goods sold:\nProducts 3,909,271 791,907 92,947 4,794,125\nServices 392,484 81,857 34,189 508,530\nTotal costs of goods sold 4,301,755 873,764 127,136 5,302,655\nGross profit 1,052,007 220,556 53,815 1,326,378\nOperating expenses:\nSelling and administrative expenses 771,066 178,377 35,221 984,664\nSeverance and restructuring\nexpenses 12,783 2,639 216 15,638\nAcquisition and integration related\nexpenses 1,486 678 2 2,166\nEarnings from operations $ 266,672 $ 38,862 $ 18,376 $ 323,910\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNorth\nAmerica EMEA APAC Consolidated\nNet sales:\nProducts $ 4,695,751 $ 1,006,216 $ 101,441 $ 5,803,408\nServices 896,251 166,910 73,260 1,136,421\nTotal net sales 5,592,002 1,173,126 174,701 6,939,829\nCosts of goods sold:\nProducts 4,206,071 920,956 92,693 5,219,720\nServices 393,788 59,526 33,420 486,734\nTotal costs of goods sold 4,599,859 980,482 126,113 5,706,454\nGross profit 992,143 192,644 48,588 1,233,375\nOperating expenses:\nSelling and administrative expenses 745,259 159,253 33,525 938,037\nSeverance and restructuring\nexpenses, net 1,052 1,840 63 2,955\nAcquisition and integration related\nexpenses 1,127 3,322 — 4,449\nEarnings from operations $ 244,705 $ 28,229 $ 15,000 $ 287,934\n20\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following is a summary of our total assets by reportable operating segment (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nNorth America $ 6,500,158 $ 6,521,591\nEMEA 1,358,765 1,058,734\nAPAC 186,013 171,820\nCorporate assets and intercompany eliminations, net (758,493) (1,465,795)\nTotal assets $ 7,286,443 $ 6,286,350\nWe recorded the following pre-tax amounts, by reportable operating segment, for depreciation\nand amortization in the accompanying consolidated financial statements (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDepreciation and amortization of property\nand equipment:\nNorth America $ 6,160 $ 6,064 $ 18,403 $ 17,207\nEMEA 917 726 2,574 1,925\nAPAC 127 112 396 323\n7,204 6,902 21,373 19,455\nAmortization of intangible assets:\nNorth America 16,823 7,718 45,557 23,269\nEMEA 1,805 822 5,135 1,642\nAPAC 74 108 292 332\n18,702 8,648 50,984 25,243\nTotal $ 25,906 $ 15,550 $ 72,357 $ 44,698\n10. Acquisition\nInfocenter\nEffective May 1, 2024, we acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of\nInfocenter.io Corporation (\"Infocenter\") for a cash purchase price of $265,000,000, net of cash and cash\nequivalents acquired of $5,103,000, which is comprised of the initial purchase price of $269,477,000 paid\nin cash upon the acquisition and contractual adjustments to the purchase price of $626,000 paid in July\n2024. The purchase price also includes the estimated fair value of earn out payments of approximately\n$24,200,000, which provide an incentive opportunity for the sellers of up to $106,250,000, based on\nInfocenter achieving certain EBITDA performance through April 2026. Infocenter is a pure-play ServiceNow\nElite Partner dedicated to automating business processes on the Now Platform®. We believe this\nacquisition enhances our Solutions Integrator offering framework to drive better business outcomes for our\nclients by enabling them to scale their multicloud environments with modern infrastructure, applications,\nand unified data and AI platforms.\n21\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was approximately $97,362,000, including\napproximately $123,900,000 of identifiable intangible assets, consisting primarily of customer relationships\nthat will be amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of ten years. As\nthese intangible assets are not tax deductible, we recognized a related deferred tax liability of\napproximately $31,832,000. The preliminary purchase price was allocated using the information currently\navailable. Further information obtained upon the finalization of the fair value assumptions for identifiable\nintangible assets acquired and various accrued expense balance assessments could lead to an adjustment\nof the purchase price allocation. Goodwill acquired approximated $191,838,000, which was recorded in our\nNorth America operating segment.\nWe consolidated the results of operations for Infocenter within our North America operating\nsegment since its acquisition on May 1, 2024. Our historical results would not have been materially affected\nby the acquisition of Infocenter and, accordingly, we have not presented pro forma information as if the\nacquisition had been completed at the beginning of each period presented in our consolidated statement of\noperations.\nWe recognized net gains within selling and administrative expenses of $4,000,000 due to the net\ndecrease in the estimated fair value of the earnout payments for both the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nSADA\nEffective December 1, 2023, we acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of\nSADA Systems, LLC (successor to SADA Systems, Inc. via conversion) (\"SADA\") for a cash purchase price\nof $399,762,000, excluding cash and cash equivalents acquired of $24,701,000. SADA is a leading cloud\nconsultancy and technical services provider and six-time Google Cloud Partner of the Year, including cloud\nlicensing and professional services to small, mid-sized and corporate/enterprise commercial clients, state\nand federal governments and educational institutions across North America, Europe and Asia. Based in Los\nAngeles, California, SADA has three office locations in North America, India and Armenia with more than\n800 teammates. We believe that this acquisition advances our strategy and further strengthens our unique\nposition as a leading Solutions Integrator offering market-leading multicloud solutions at scale. We further\nbelieve SADA's partnership with Google Cloud will enhance our ability to serve clients who operate across\nmultiple clouds and accelerate adoption of widely sought-after technologies like GenAI. SADA is being\nreported as a part of our North America operating segment.\nThe total purchase price of $426,050,000, which is net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of\n$24,701,000, is comprised of the initial purchase price of $423,290,000 paid in cash upon the SADA\nacquisition, contractual adjustments to the purchase price of $1,173,000 paid in March 2024 and a seller\nretention fund of $5,000,000 payable post-closing. The purchase price also includes the estimated fair\nvalue of earnout payments of approximately $21,288,000, which provides an incentive opportunity for the\nsellers of up to $390,000,000, based on the SADA business achieving EBITDA and revenue growth\nperformance through 2026. A portion of the purchase price was used to settle SADA’s stock-based\ncompensation liabilities of $68,335,000 and pay SADA’s transaction costs of approximately $16,852,000 at\nacquisition and after contractual adjustments in accordance with the purchase agreement.\n22\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price and the estimated fair value of\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (in thousands):\nTotal purchase price, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired $ 426,050\nFair value of net assets acquired:\nCurrent assets $ 348,043\nIdentifiable intangible assets - see description below 158,100\nProperty and equipment 2,266\nOther assets 244,342\nCurrent liabilities (332,010)\nLong-term liabilities, including long-term accounts payable (115,171)\nTotal fair value of net assets acquired 305,570\nExcess purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired\n(\"goodwill\") $ 120,480\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price as shown in the table\nabove was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based\non their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired was\nrecorded as goodwill. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a net adjustment of $3,458,000\nwas recorded to reduce goodwill, primarily due to certain measurement period adjustments to accounts\nreceivable, contract assets, net, accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nThe estimated fair values of the majority of the current assets and liabilities are based upon\ntheir historical costs on the date of acquisition due to their short-term nature, with the exception of\ncontract assets. The estimated fair value of the property and equipment are also based upon historical\ncosts as they approximate fair value. The contract assets are an exception to the fair value model and are\nevaluated under relevant revenue recognition guidance including an allowance for credit losses using the\ncurrent expected credit loss (“CECL”) model.\nThe preliminary estimated fair value of net assets acquired was approximately $305,570,000,\nincluding $158,100,000 of identifiable intangible assets, consisting primarily of customer relationships of\n$124,700,000 and non-compete agreements of $26,200,000. The fair values were determined using the\nmultiple-period excess earnings method and the lost income method, respectively.\nThe identifiable intangibles resulting from the acquisition are amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over the following estimated useful lives:\nIntangible Assets Estimated Economic Life\nCustomer relationships 10 Years\nTrade name 3 Years\nNon-compete agreements 3-5 Years\nGoodwill of $120,480,000, which was recorded in our North America operating segment,\nrepresents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to tangible and\nidentifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from SADA. The goodwill is not amortized and\nwill be tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The addition of the SADA\ntechnical employees to our team and the opportunity to grow our business are the primary factors making\nup the goodwill recognized as part of the transaction.\n23\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe intangible assets and goodwill are tax deductible as the transaction is a deemed asset\nacquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the Seller Parties undertook an internal restructuring\npursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(F).\nThe purchase price allocation is preliminary and was allocated using information currently\navailable. Further information related to accounts receivable, contract assets, accounts payable, goodwill\nand various accrued expense balance assessments may lead to an adjustment of the purchase price\nallocation.\nWe have consolidated the results of operations for SADA since its acquisition on December 1,\n2023. Our historical results would not have been materially affected by the acquisition of SADA and,\naccordingly, we have not presented pro forma information as if the acquisition had been completed at the\nbeginning of each period presented in our consolidated statement of operations.\nWe recognized net gains within selling and administrative expenses of $20,684,000 due to the\nnet decrease in the estimated fair value of the earnout payments for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024.\nAmdaris\nEffective August 17, 2023, we acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of\nAmdaris Group Limited (“Amdaris”) for a cash purchase price, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, of\napproximately $82,875,000, excluding the estimated fair value of an earnout, reported in other liabilities,\nwith a range of payouts through 2026 of $0 to $54,391,000. We paid the earnout of $14,348,000 for\nAmdaris' 2023 performance in March 2024. Amdaris, an award-winning software development and digital\nservices specialist, provides innovative software development, application support, managed services and\nconsultancy services to the customers in the United Kingdom with service delivery centers located in\nseveral eastern European countries. Amdaris has been recognized as a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner. We\nbelieve this acquisition expands our global Modern Apps and Data & AI areas of solutions expertise as a\nleading solutions integrator and enhances our technological capabilities and scale to deliver an even\nbroader range of customized services and solutions to clients in EMEA.\nThe fair value of net assets acquired was approximately $34,060,000, including $41,291,000 of\nidentifiable intangible assets, consisting primarily of customer relationships that will be amortized using the\nstraight line method over the estimated economic life of ten years. The purchase price was allocated using\nthe information available. During the first quarter of 2024, we finalized the fair value assumptions for\nidentifiable intangible assets with no changes being made to amounts previously recorded. Goodwill\nacquired approximated $71,698,000, which was recorded in our EMEA operating segment.\nWe consolidated the results of operations for Amdaris within our EMEA operating segment\nbeginning on August 17, 2023, the effective date of the acquisition. Our historical results would not have\nbeen materially affected by the acquisition of Amdaris and, accordingly, we have not presented pro forma\ninformation as if the acquisition had been completed at the beginning of each period presented in our\nconsolidated statement of operations.\nWe recognized net gains within selling and administrative expenses of $2,442,000 and\n$6,430,000 due to the net decrease in the estimated fair value of the earnout payments for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n24\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements\nand the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We refer to our\ncustomers as “clients,” our suppliers as “partners” and our employees as “teammates.”\nQuarterly Overview\nToday, every business is a technology business. We help our clients accelerate their digital\njourney to modernize their businesses and maximize the value of technology. We serve these clients in\nNorth America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). As a Fortune 500-\nranked solutions integrator, we enable secure, end-to-end digital transformation and meet the needs of our\nclients through a comprehensive portfolio of solutions, far-reaching partnerships and 36 years of broad IT\nexpertise. We amplify our solutions and services with global scale, local expertise and our e-commerce\nexperience, enabling our clients to realize their digital ambitions in multiple ways. Our offerings in North\nAmerica and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware, software and services, including cloud\nsolutions. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments consist largely of software and\ncertain software-related services and cloud solutions.\nOn a consolidated basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2024:\n• Net sales of $2.1 billion decreased 8% compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease in net sales reflects decreases in hardware and software net sales,\npartially offset by an increase in services net sales. Excluding the effects of fluctuating\nforeign currency exchange rates, net sales also decreased 8% compared to the third quarter\nof 2023.\n• Gross profit of $432.1 million increased 6% compared to the three months ended September\n30, 2023. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, gross profit\nincreased 5% compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n• Compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, gross margin expanded\napproximately 270 basis points to 20.7% of net sales in the three months ended September\n30, 2024. This expansion primarily reflects an increase in higher margin services net sales\ncompared to the same period in the prior year.\n• Earnings from operations increased 1%, year over year, to $92.9 million in the third quarter\nof 2024 compared to $91.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily\ndue to an increase in gross profit in the current quarter, partially offset by an increase in\nselling and administrative expenses. Excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency\nexchange rates, earnings from operations also increased 1% year over year.\n• Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $58.2 million and $1.52, respectively, for\nthe third quarter of 2024. This compares to net earnings of $60.2 million and diluted\nearnings per share of $1.62 for the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share\ndecreased 6% year to year, and excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency\nexchange rates, also decreased 6% year to year.\n25\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nThroughout the “Quarterly Overview” and “Results of Operations” sections of this “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we refer to changes in net sales,\ngross profit, selling and administrative expenses and earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and\nin North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates,\nwhich are financial measures that are adjusted from our financial results prepared in accordance with the\nUnited States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We believe providing this information\nexcluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates provides valuable supplemental\ninformation to investors regarding our underlying business and results of operations, consistent with how\nwe, including our management, evaluate our performance. In computing the changes in amounts and\npercentages, we compare the current period amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable\naccounting standards to the prior period amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the\nweighted average translation rate for the current period. The performance measures excluding the effects\nof fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the\nmeasures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nDetails about segment results of operations can be found in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist\nin the understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in\nthose consolidated financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that contributed to\nthose changes, as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nSupply Chain Constraints, Demand and Inflation Update\nSupply constraints that have had an industry-wide impact since the beginning of 2020 eased in\nthe second half of 2023. We believe that any remaining supply constraints and extended lead times for\ncertain infrastructure, including networking products, have now normalized back to near historic levels.\nDespite the easing supply constraints, we continue to see a general slowdown in our clients' decision\nmaking, which we believe will continue in the short term.\nInflation contributed to higher interest rates on all of our variable rate facilities. While these\ninterest rates are expected to decrease, we anticipate higher than historical rates for the remainder of\n2024. We are actively monitoring changes to the global macroeconomic environment, including those\nimpacting our supply chain and interest rates, and assessing the potential impacts these challenges may\nhave on our current results, financial condition and liquidity. We are also mindful of the potential impact\nthese conditions could have on our clients, partners and prospects for the remainder of 2024 and beyond.\n26\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a\nsummary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,\nItem 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The preparation of\nthese consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,\nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities\nthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ from estimates we\nhave made. Members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and\nrelated disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nThere have been no changes to the items disclosed as critical accounting estimates in\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7\nof our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCosts of goods sold 79.3 82.0 80.0 82.2\nGross profit 20.7 18.0 20.0 17.8\nSelling and administrative expenses 15.9 13.7 14.9 13.5\nSeverance and restructuring expenses, net\nand acquisition and integration related\nexpenses 0.4 0.2 0.2 0.2\nEarnings from operations 4.4 4.1 4.9 4.1\nNon-operating expense, net 0.8 0.6 0.7 0.4\nEarnings before income taxes 3.6 3.5 4.2 3.7\nIncome tax expense 0.8 0.8 1.0 1.0\nNet earnings 2.8 % 2.7 % 3.2 % 2.7 %\nWe generally experience some seasonal trends in our sales of IT hardware, software and\nservices. Software and certain cloud net sales are typically seasonally higher in our second and fourth\nquarters. Business clients, particularly larger enterprise businesses in the United States, tend to spend\nmore, particularly on product, in our fourth quarter. Sales to the federal government in the United States\nare often stronger in our third quarter, while sales in the state and local government and education markets\nare also often stronger in our second quarter. Sales to public sector clients in the United Kingdom are often\nstronger in our first quarter. These trends create overall variability in our consolidated results.\nOur gross profit across the business and related to product versus services sales are, and will\ncontinue to be, impacted by partner incentives, which can and do change significantly in the amounts made\navailable and in the related product or services sales being incentivized by the partner. Incentives from our\nlargest partners are significant and changes in the amounts and incentive requirements, including those\nrelated to cloud transactions, which occur regularly, have and could continue to impact our results of\noperations to the extent we are unable to shift our\n27\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nfocus and respond to them.

The increase in earnings from operations was primarily driven by an increase in gross profit, partially\noffset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses, when compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nAPAC's earnings from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 23%, or\n$3.4 million (also increasing 23% when excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange\nrates), compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, earnings\nfrom operations increased by approximately 160 basis points to 10.2%. The increase in earnings from\noperations was primarily driven by an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in selling and\nadministrative expenses, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNon-Operating Expense (Income).\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net primarily relates to borrowings under our ABL\nfacility, the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2032 (the \"Senior Notes\"), the Convertible Notes and imputed\ninterest under our inventory financing facilities, partially offset by interest income generated from interest\nearned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. Interest expense, net for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 increased 38%, or $4.6 million, compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023. This was primarily due to the issuance of the Senior Notes in May 2024 partially offset by lower loan\nbalances under our ABL facility, increased interest income and decreased imputed interest under our\ninventory financing facilities. Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nincreased 37%, or $11.6 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the issuance of the Senior Notes and higher loan\nbalances under our ABL facility, partially offset by decreased imputed interest under our inventory financing\nfacilities and higher interest income.\nImputed interest under our inventory financing facilities was $2.5 million and $7.3 million for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.2 million and $10.7 million for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in imputed interest under our inventory\nfinancing facilities was a result of lower average daily balances under the facilities during the period. For a\ndescription of our various financing facilities, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I,\nItem 1 of this report.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate of 22.5% for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 was lower than our effective tax rate of 24.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to\ntax benefits related to the revaluation of certain acquisition earnout liabilities and increased tax benefits for\nresearch and development activities recorded in the current year period.\nOur effective tax rate of 24.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than\nour effective tax rate of 25.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the\neffective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to tax benefits related\nto the revaluation of certain acquisition earnout liabilities and higher excess tax benefits on the settlement\nof employee share-based compensation in the current year period.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Pillar II Initiative\nintroduced a 15% global minimum tax for certain multinational groups exceeding minimum annual global\nrevenue thresholds. Several countries in which Insight operates have enacted legislation adopting the\nminimum tax effective January 1, 2024. The minimum tax did not have a material impact on our effective\ntax rate as of September 30, 2024, nor do we expect it to have a material impact on our 2024 annual\neffective tax rate. We will continue to monitor any future impact as additional countries enact legislation to\nadopt this tax.\n36\n37\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated cash flow information for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 417,731 $ 413,742\nNet cash used in investing activities (288,868) (96,430)\nNet cash used in financing activities (82,523) (235,628)\nForeign currency exchange effect on cash, cash equivalent and restricted\ncash balances 2,660 (1,074)\nIncrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 49,000 80,610\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 270,785 165,718\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 319,785 $ 246,328\nCash and Cash Flow\n• Our primary uses of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were to fund\nthe acquisition of Infocenter, repay debt, including principal upon conversion of a portion of\nthe Convertible Notes, fund repurchases of our common stock and to pay earnouts and other\nacquisition related payments.\n• Operating activities provided $417.7 million in cash during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $413.7 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Capital expenditures were $32.4 million and $29.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid approximately $265.0 million,\nto acquire Infocenter, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of $5.1 million.\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased $200.0 million of our\ncommon stock compared to $217.1 million of repurchases during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n• We issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which we used to\npay down a portion of our borrowings under our ABL facility.\n• We had net repayments under our ABL facility during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 of $333.3 million, using proceeds from the Senior Notes, compared to net borrowings\nof $34.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• We had net borrowings under our inventory financing facilities of $3.1 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to net repayments of $32.5 million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023.\nWe anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with the funds available under our\nfinancing facilities, will be adequate to support our expected cash and working capital requirements for\noperations, as well as other strategic acquisitions, over the next 12 months and beyond. We expect existing\ncash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating cash activities and\ncash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as capital expenditures, strategic\nacquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, principal payment on the Convertible Notes that mature in\nFebruary 2025 and are freely convertible at the option of the Convertible Note holders, debt repayments\nand repayment of our inventory financing facilities for the next 12 months. We currently expect to fund\nknown cash commitments\n38\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nbeyond the next 12 months through operating cash activities and/or other available financing resources.\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n• Our cash conversion cycle is inverted, meaning on average we pay our partners on terms\nshorter than we receive payments from our clients. This means we generate more cash in\nour operations in periods of sequential decline in sales and particularly in hardware net sales.\n• Cash flow provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 was $417.7 million\ncompared to cash provided by operating activities of $413.7 million in the first nine months\nof 2023.\n• Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 1% during the first nine months of 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023.\nOur consolidated cash flow operating metrics were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nDays sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable (“DSOs”) (a) 172 125\nDays inventory outstanding (“DIOs”) (b) 8 9\nDays purchases outstanding in ending accounts payable (“DPOs”) (c) (162) (99)\nCash conversion cycle (days) (d) 18 35\n(a)Calculated as the balance of current accounts receivable, net at the end of the quarter\ndivided by daily net sales. Daily net sales is calculated as net sales for the quarter divided by\n92 days.\n(b)Calculated as the balance of inventories at the end of the quarter divided by daily costs of\ngoods sold. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter\ndivided by 92 days.\n(c) Calculated as the sum of the balances of accounts payable – trade and accounts payable –\ninventory financing facilities at the end of the quarter divided by daily costs of goods sold.\nDaily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92\ndays.\n(d)Calculated as DSOs plus DIOs, less DPOs.\n• Our cash conversion cycle was 18 days in the third quarter of 2024, down from 35 days in\nthe third quarter of 2023.\n• The net changes were a result of a 63 day increase in DPOs and a 1 day decrease in DIOs,\npartially offset by a 47 day increase in DSOs.\n• The net decrease in our cash conversion cycle year over year was primarily the result of:\n• the impact to DPOs of the SADA acquisition, a significant agency transaction that\nbased on its terms had not cleared by quarter end and changes in vendor mix;\n• the benefit to DIOs of the reduction in hardware sales and changes in our operating\nstrategy; and\n• the impact to DSOs of the SADA acquisition combined with a significant agency\ntransaction that based on its terms had not cleared by quarter end.\n• Our cash conversion cycle is impacted by netted costs that we apply to our services net sales\nto appropriately record net sales that we earn as an agent. These netted costs, while\nexcluded from both net sales and cost of goods sold, are processed and applied to accounts\nreceivable and accounts payable in each reporting period. As a result, our DSO and DPO\ncalculated on the basis of unadjusted net sales and\n39\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nunadjusted cost of goods sold are inherently inflated. Netted costs were $2.4 billion and\n$1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Adjusting our cash\nconversion cycle calculation by adding netted costs to both daily net sales and daily cost of\ngoods sold results in a decrease to our cash conversion cycle from 18 days to 17 days in the\nthird quarter of 2024 and results in a decrease from 35 days down to 25 days in the third\nquarter of 2023, which we believe provides a more accurate reflection of our cash flow\noperating metrics.\n• We expect that cash flow from operations will be used, at least partially, to fund working\ncapital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average\nterms we grant to our clients to take advantage of supplier discounts.\n• We intend to use cash generated in the remainder of 2024 in excess of working capital needs\nto pay down our ABL facility and inventory financing facilities and for strategic acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities\n• We paid $265.0 million to acquire Infocenter on May 1, 2024, net of cash and cash\nequivalents acquired of $5.1 million. Additionally, we paid $5.2 million, net of cash and cash\nequivalents acquired, to acquire an entity in our EMEA segment, on July 1, 2024.\n• We acquired Amdaris for approximately $82.9 million, net of cash and cash equivalents\nacquired and excluding earn outs and hold backs in the nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\n• We received proceeds from the sale of assets of $13.8 million in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n• We received proceeds from the sale of assets, including our properties held for sale, of $15.5\nmillion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Capital expenditures were $32.4 million and $29.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n• We expect capital expenditures for the full year 2024 to be in a range of $35.0 to $40.0\nmillion.\nNet cash used in financing activities\n• In May 2024, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which\nwe used to pay down a portion of our borrowings under our ABL facility.\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments under our ABL\nfacility of $333.3 million using proceeds from the Senior Notes.\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net borrowings under our ABL\nfacility that increased our outstanding long-term debt balance by $34.3 million.\n• We had net borrowings under our inventory financing facilities of $3.1 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to net repayments of $32.5 million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• We repaid approximately $16.9 million principal upon conversion of a portion of the\nConvertible Notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable\nactivity in the prior year period.\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made earnout and acquisition\nrelated payments of $18.3 million associated with our Amdaris and Hanu acquisitions.\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid $10.7 million, the majority of\nthe earnout associated with the Hanu acquisition.\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased $200.0 million of our\ncommon stock.\n40\nTable of Contents\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n• During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased $217.1 million of our\ncommon stock.\nFinancing Facilities\nOur debt balance as of September 30, 2024 was $1,086.8 million. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe current portion of our long-term debt primarily relates to the Convertible Notes.\n• Our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to\nmeet overall business objectives.\n• The Convertible Notes are subject to certain events of default and certain acceleration\nclauses. As of September 30, 2024, no such events have occurred.\n• The Senior Notes are subject to certain events of default and certain acceleration clauses. As\nof September 30, 2024, no such events have occurred.\n• Our ABL facility contains various covenants customary for transactions of this type, including\ncomplying with a minimum receivable and inventory requirement and meeting monthly,\nquarterly and annual reporting requirements.\n• The credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and\nevents of default.\n• At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\n• While the ABL facility has a stated maximum amount, the actual availability under the\nABL facility is limited by a minimum accounts receivable and inventory requirement.\nAs of September 30, 2024, eligible accounts receivable and inventory were sufficient\nto permit access to the full $1.8 billion under the ABL facility of which $262.4 million\nwas outstanding.\nWe also have agreements with financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory\nfrom various suppliers under certain terms and conditions.\n• These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable – inventory financing facilities in\nour consolidated balance sheets.\n• Our inventory financing facilities have an aggregate availability for vendor purchases of\n$705.0 million, of which $235.2 million was outstanding at September 30, 2024.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nCash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income\ntaxation upon repatriation to the United States. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $272.1\nmillion in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, primarily residing in Canada, the\nNetherlands and Australia. Certain of these cash balances will be remitted to the United States by paying\ndown intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business or through actual dividend\ndistributions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, which include indemnifications.
